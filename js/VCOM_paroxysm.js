If you're irritated to the point of having a wild fit, like if you see someone trying to steal your car, you might go into a paroxysm of rage. When the clowns performed their act, the audience went into a paroxysm of giggles. A paroxysm can be medical, too, like when an illness suddenly attacks, and you get symptoms like chills and a fever right away.</p></div>`;
