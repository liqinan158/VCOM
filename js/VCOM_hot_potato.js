A <i>hot potato</i> is an issue that makes everyone feel uncomfortable.</p><p class="long">The phrase <i>hot potato</i> comes up a lot in politics. For example, a reporter might explain that a candidate won't speak about a controversial topic because it's "a political <i>hot potato</i>," or an issue that people disagree strongly about. <i>Hot potato</i> comes from the idea of passing a literal hot baked potato from one person to another â€” no one wants to be left holding it for very long, because it will burn their fingers.</p></div></div>`;
