This bacterial disease is caused by the bacillus Mycobacterium leprae. Leprosy occurs in tropical and subtropical areas, and it's a chronic disease, meaning it doesn't go away. The flesh and organs of a person with leprosy waste away, kind of like a dead personâ€™s. Leprosy also involves inflamed white sores forming underneath the skin. Someone with leprosy is called a leper.</p></div></div>`;
