If you're scared about speaking in public you might have a <i>tremor</i> in your voice â€” or wish that an earthquake <i>tremor</i> would open up the floor and swallow you first.</p><p class="long">If you're nervous or feeling queasy as you read a paper aloud, you might get a tremor in your hands and the paper itself will start to shake. When an earthquake rumbles, a powerful tremor might make a building shake so that it looks as fragile as a piece of paper. Not every tremor comes from fear or seismic activity, though: you can tremor or quiver with excitement as you anticipate something enjoyable.</p></div>`;
