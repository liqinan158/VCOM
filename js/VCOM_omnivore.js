Pigs are <i>omnivores</i>, so they would be just as happy eating an apple, or the worm inside the apple.</p><p class="long"><i>Omnivore</i> comes from the Latin words <i>omni</i>, meaning "all, everything," and <i>vorare</i>, meaning "to devour." So an omnivore will eat pretty much eat anything in sight. Humans are genetically designed to be omnivores, but some people choose to limit their diets. When a person is described as an <i>omnivore</i>, it usually means he's willing to eat all kinds of foods and is not a vegetarian or a vegan or on some other kind of special diet.</p></div></div>`;
