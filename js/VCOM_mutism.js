Some types of <i>mutism</i> are caused by brain injury, while others have to do with the vocal cords.</p><p class="long">You can also call mutism <i>muteness</i>. Both words stem from <i>mute</i>, which is rooted in the Latin <i>mutus</i>, "silent or speechless." Occasionally, mutism is the result of a person's conscious decision not to speak, but it can also be connected to trauma, delays in development, or a type of paralysis of the larynx, also known as the voice box.</p></div></div>`;
