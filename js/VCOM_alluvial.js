Think of a city in the aftermath of a flood — streets littered with things that had once been floating — tree branches, parts of buildings, and lots of sand and silt.</p><p class="long"><i>Alluvial</i> comes from the Latin word for washed, but the stuff water leaves behind doesn't often feel clean. In fact, the word is so closely associated with leftover debris that its meaning goes beyond flooding. If you have a party when your parents are out of town, you’d better get up early and clean up all the alluvial evidence.</p></div>`;
