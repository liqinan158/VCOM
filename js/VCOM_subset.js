For example, "new horror films" or "new comedies" are <i>subsets</i> of "new movies."</p><p class="long">You can use the word <i>subset</i> any time you refer to small sets within larger ones, whether you're talking about Halloween candy, greeting cards, or classmates. However, the most common use of <i>subset</i> happens in mathematics, which is where the word comes from originally. <i>Subset</i> is short for "subordinate set," or a set that is entirely contained inside another set â€” it's subordinate, less important or smaller.</p></div></div>`;
