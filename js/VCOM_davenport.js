In some parts of the U.S., a davenport is an especially fancy sofa, while in others it's one that can be converted into a bed. The name comes from a 19th century Massachusetts furniture maker, A.H. Davenport and Company. The family name <i>Davenport</i> goes back to a town in Cheshire, England. Earlier, the word referred to a small desk used for writing letters.</p></div></div>`;
