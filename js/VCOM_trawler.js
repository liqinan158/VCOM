Both words come from the Middle Dutch <i>traghelen</i> and its root, the Latin <i>tragula</i>, "dragnet." That's exactly what a trawler (also called a <i>dragger</i>) doesâ€”it drags a net behind it. Trawlers are controversial, because although strictly regulated, they can damage seabeds and accidentally catch fish that are endangered or too small.</p></div></div>`;
