Your <i>unconcealed</i> affection for your dog is evident to everyone â€” you talk about her adorable antics nonstop, hang pictures of her in your locker, and throw her a lavish birthday party every year.</p><p class="long">When things are concealed, they're covered up or guarded, like a spy's concealed identity or a birthmark that's concealed with makeup. Add the prefix <i>un-</i>, or "not," and you get <i>unconcealed</i>, which is a great word for describing things that are right out in the open. Your unconcealed love for language is obvious from all of those vocabulary quizzes you're always taking!</p></div></div>`;
