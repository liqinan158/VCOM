Before the 1950s, there were many white segregationists who actively opposed the integration of schools, workplaces, and neighborhoods, and until 1967 it was still illegal for black and white people to marry each other in some US states. <i>Segregationist</i> comes from the Latin root <i>segregare</i>, "set apart, isolate, or divide."</p></div>`;
