var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">rub</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>rub</i> is to push firmly and repeatedly, like when you <i>rub</i> your sore foot. When Hamlet says, "aye, there's the <i>rub</i>," he's not talking about getting a massage. <i>Rub</i>, as a noun, is an obstacle or something in your way.</p><p class="long">You can rub someone's aching back or rub sunblock on your arms and legs. You can also watch chunks of melting ice on a lake's surface rub against each other or complain that your new shoes rub your heels and give you blisters. Colloquially, you might <i>rub off</i> on your friends, or begin to influence them by your mere presence. If, however, you rub them the wrong way, you irritate or annoy them. The noun <i>rub</i> is not used nearly as often as the verb, but people do love to allude to Hamlet's "aye, there's the <i>rub</i>" line in the "to be or not to be" soliloquy, referring to the unforeseen dreams of death that haunt mankind.</p></div></div>`;
