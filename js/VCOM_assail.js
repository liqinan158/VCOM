So picture an attacker jumping on you, throwing punches and maybe some insults, too. Because <i>assail</i> also means to ridicule or heap your worries upon someone. As novelist Charlotte Bronte noted, “Conventionality is not morality. Self-righteousness is not religion. To attack the first is not to <i>assail</i> the last.” Think on that.</p></div></div>`;
