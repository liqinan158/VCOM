Yuck.</p><p class="long">If you've got to decide between cleaning the bathroom and taking out the trash, you could call those two unappealing choices. And if your family plans to vacation at a working farm instead of Disney World, that may also sound unappealing. Anything unappealing doesn't please you or catch your interest. This word is formed by adding the prefix <i>un-</i> ("not") to <i>appealing</i>, which can be traced back to a Latin root meaning "to summon."</p></div></div>`;
