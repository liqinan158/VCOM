var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">delicate</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Delicate</i> things, like a flower, a necklace, or someone’s feelings are fragile, easily broken, and often quite beautiful.</p><p class="long">A delicate situation. A delicate balance. A delicate child. A delicate lace design. A delicate taste. Sometimes the word implies intricate beauty and at other times fragility. <i>Delicate</i> can have negative overtones: A delicate situation is a tricky one. A delicate balance describes an agreement that might turn sour any moment. A delicate child may cry easily. But <i>delicate</i> can also refer to things that are very lovely and hard to reproduce: a delicate lace collar on a dress stands out. A delicate flavor, like pomegranate peach mint sauce, makes salad — or vanilla ice cream — much more delicious.</p></div>`;
