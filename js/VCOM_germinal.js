That's the germinal stage.</p><p class="long">To correctly pronounce <i>germinal</i>, accent the first syllable: "JER-mih-nul." You can see and hear <i>germ</i> in <i>germinal</i>. It comes from the Latin word <i>germen</i>, or "sprout, bud, sprig, offshoot."  So, something in its germinal stage is just beginning, like when you are thinking about possible topics for the research report you are going to write.</p></div>`;
