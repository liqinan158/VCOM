Acting like you have a job on Wall Street when you're actually unemployed would take a lot of <i>guile</i>.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>guile</i> has quite negative connotations, as it refers to the kind of knowledge and skill that can be used by comic book villains for evil and not good! People who have <i>guile</i> are also thought of as being <i>wily</i> (which is also a related word), <i>sneaky</i>, and <i>deceitful</i>. Those who are free of guile are pure and upstanding, and Henry David Thoreau affirms those feelings when he writes: "It is the work of a brave man surely, in whom there was no guile!"</p></div></div>`;
