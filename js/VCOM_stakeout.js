Most <i>stakeouts</i> are done stealthily, with the officers trying to avoid being seen.</p><p class="long">Detectives on a stakeout often spend long hours sitting in an unmarked police car, watching a house or building. The stakeout might, for example, be used to prove that a suspect who claims to need a wheelchair can actually to walk, or that two people who say they've never met each other are actually close friends. The word comes from the <i>stake</i> that a surveyor uses to mark off a piece of land, and it's been around since the 1940's.</p></div></div>`;
