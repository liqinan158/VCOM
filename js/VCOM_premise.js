When you called 911 on the guy in your back yard, it was on the <i>premise</i> that he was a thief and not the meter-reader.</p><p class="long">In logic, the <i>premise</i> is the basic statement upon whose truth an argument is based. Criticize alternative theories by demonstrating their false premises.  In a more general sense, it's a basic assertion. On the premise that people are generally good, you keep your doors unlocked. <i>Premise</i> is also used more loosely for the starting point for a plot. A movie's premise could be that two people trapped on a desert island will inevitably fall in love.</p></div>`;
