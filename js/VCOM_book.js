The noun <i>book</i> can refer to a bunch of pages bound together, as in a book you read, but also a book of tickets or stamps, a section of a larger work of literature (like a book of the Bible), or the written script of a stage play. <i>Book</i> can also be a verb meaning "to record information about a criminal suspect" or "to reserve," which you could use to say, "Let's <i>book</i> a room at the nicest hotel in Maui this winter."</p></div></div>`;
