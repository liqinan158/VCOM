A doctor might gravely describe a patient's prognosis as <i>touch-and-go</i>, meaning that she's not certain whether the patient will recover.</p><p class="long">When you hope for a certain outcome but aren't sure whether it will happen, that's a perfect time to use the adjective <i>touch-and-go</i>. If you and your opponent are running neck-and-neck, the student council elections are also touch-and-go. This word most likely comes from a 17th- and 18th-century chasing game similar to tag.</p></div></div>`;
