And just as <i>solitaire</i> is a game for one, a single diamond in a ring is also a <i>solitaire</i>.</p><p class="long">Another name for the solitaire card game is <i>patience</i>. There are variations on this game, but most involve sorting cards into suits by ranking numbers (king, queen, jack, ten, etc.). The Latin root at the heart of this lonely word is <i>solitarius</i>, "alone or isolated." Originally, a <i>solitaire</i> was a widow, and eventually the word came to mean any solitary person. In the 18th century, the "gemstone" and "card game" meanings evolved.</p></div></div>`;
