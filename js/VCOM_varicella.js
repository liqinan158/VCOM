Another name for <i>varicella</i> is chickenpox. No matter what you call it, it's no fun.</p><p class="long">If your doctor mentions getting a varicella vaccine, now you'll know she's talking about giving you a shot to help prevent chickenpox. This medical term comes from Latin, and it's closely related to <i>variola</i>, or "smallpox." Both words share the root <i>varius</i>, "speckled or spotted." It's the spots, or small blisters, that make this illness so distinctive. They're obvious — and very itchy — evidence that you've come down with varicella.</p></div></div>`;
