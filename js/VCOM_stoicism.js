Your <i>stoicism</i> helps you endure physical or emotional discomfort without complaint, a helpful trait for long car trips with annoying people.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>stoicism</i>, pronounced "STOW-ih-siz-um," comes from Stoicism, the ancient Greek philosophical school, which taught that reason could overcome destructive emotions for a more virtuous life. Having great control over one’s emotions and responding calmly to misfortune are the marks of <i>stoicism</i>. If you take the good and the bad in stride without drama of any kind, your stoicism is admirable.</p></div></div>`;
