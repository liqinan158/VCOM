A telltale sign that someone has visited Paris is the tiny, metal Eiffel Tower hanging from her keychain as a <i>souvenir</i>.</p><p class="long">First recorded in 1775 as meaning “a remembrance or memory,” the noun <i>souvenir</i> stems from the French <i>souvenir</i> “to remember, come to mind.” A few years later, it took on the sense of “a token” of an event or experience. A song by Tears for Fears goes, “Love is a promise, love is a souvenir, once given never forgotten, never let it disappear.” Here, souvenir refers to a feeling, but more often it refers to something tangible, like a memento, gift, or trophy.</p></div>`;
