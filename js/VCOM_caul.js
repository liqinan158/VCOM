The <i>caul</i> is part of the anmniotic sac that protects a fetus before birth.</p><p class="long">Most mammals are enclosed within a protective membrane before they're born, and when part of this membrane is attached to a newborn, it's called a <i>caul</i>. Possibly because it's so rare for a baby to be born with this caul covering his or her head, it's been considered good luck since medieval times. The word once referred to a woman's close-fitting hat, from the French word <i>cale</i>, "cap," with a Latin root, <i>calautica</i>, "type of women's headdress."</p></div></div>`;
