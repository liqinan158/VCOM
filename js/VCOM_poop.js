When used as a verb, it means going number two.</p><p class="long"><i>Poop</i> is a very commonly used slang word that means <i>feces</i> and is far more acceptable than <i>crap</i> and <i>shit</i>. The only downside is that talking about pooping or poop sounds kind of silly. Still, no one will blink if you say "I need to take a poop" or "Go clean up your dog's poop!" There are a few other unrelated meanings â€” like the rear "poop deck" of a ship and "the poop", meaning the inside information on something.</p></div>`;
