There's a <i>spatial</i> relationship between Mars and Venus, as well as between the rose bushes in the backyard.</p><p class="long"><i>Spatial</i> has to do with the distance between things, so mathematicians and computer scientists love using the word. "They measured the <i>spatial</i> relations of ping-pong balls in the gravity-free room." It can also refer to how people perceive the objects in front of them. If you're not wearing your glasses, your <i>spatial</i> perception might be off.  If you're a space cadet, you might wander off into space. Not surprisingly, <i>spatial</i> is from the Latin word <i>spatium</i> for "space."</p></div></div>`;
