If you have long hair and pierced ears, you've probably had to <i>disentangle</i> an earring from a curl of hair.</p><p class="long">Something that becomes tangled or twisted needs someone to disentangle it â€” you might disentangle your kitten from a length of yarn, or disentangle your jacket from a thorny bush when you're hiking through the woods. You can also disentangle someone figuratively, helping them get out of an uncomfortable or difficult situation. <i>Tangle</i> is at the heart of <i>disentangle</i>, from the fourteenth century word <i>tagilen</i>, "to involve in a difficult situation."</p></div>`;
