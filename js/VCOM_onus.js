If your teacher assigns <i>onus</i> as a vocabulary word, it puts the <i>onus</i> on you to find out what it means.</p><p class="long"><i>Onus</i> is a formal or sophisticated way to say "responsibility" or "duty." It sounds a little like the unrelated word <i>owner</i>, so think about the person with onus as owner of the responsibility. If the onus is on you to organize a fund raiser, you have to set the whole thing up. Have you ever heard the legal term <i>onus probandi</i>? It means the burden of proof, which requires the accuser to prove the case against the accused.</p></div></div>`;
