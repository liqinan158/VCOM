At a construction site, almost anything could be injurious, if you don't know what you're doing (or even if you do). Falling off a ladder could be very injurious. Even crossing the street can have injurious effects if you're hit by a car. If this word turns up in your diary a dozen times, you're probably in the hospital.</p></div>`;
