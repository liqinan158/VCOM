The Liberty Bell cracked the first time the <i>clapper</i> struck the sides of the bell. The bell was recast twice, but eventually the <i>clapper</i> cracked that bell as well.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>clapper</i> is based on clap, from the Old English word <i>clappan</i>, which means to clap, throb, or beat. The word is supposed to be imitative of the sound the thing makes. When the clapper strikes the inside of a bell, it makes the bell ring. If you need the bell to be silent, you have to muffle the clapper to keep it from striking the inside of the bell and making a sound.</p></div></div>`;
