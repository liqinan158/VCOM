When you and your friends huddle awkwardly around the snack table at a party, whispering and trying to muster enough nerve to hit the dance floor, you’ve formed a <i>cluster</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Cluster</i> comes to us from the Old English word <i>clyster</i>, meaning bunch. Nowadays, you can use <i>cluster</i> as either a noun or a verb. When we were kids, we would stand in a cluster (noun) on the street corner, eagerly awaiting the appearance of the Good Humor truck every afternoon. Then we would cluster (verb) eagerly around the driver, demanding ice cream. Virtually anything can form a cluster — flowers, cells, stars, human beings, and even events.</p></div>`;
