A pregnant woman might have a <i>sonogram</i> to get a picture of her fetus.</p><p class="long">A sonogram most commonly produces a two-dimensional black and white image â€” for example, of a fetus inside its mother's uterus. Doctors use sonograms to see organs, tendons, muscles, and joints as well. A sonogram works by bouncing high frequency sounds against tissue and displaying the reflected or echoed image. The word itself combines the Latin <i>sonus</i>, or "sound," and the word-forming suffix <i>-gram</i>.</p></div></div>`;
