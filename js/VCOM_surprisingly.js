You might discover that the day is surprisingly warm, and you don't need your furry hat after all; or you may realize that college is surprisingly difficult after you breezed through high school. The French root word is <i>surprise</i>, "a taking unawares," which comes from <i>surprendre</i>, "to overtake." <i>Surprisingly</i> is surprisingly old, dating from the 1600's.</p></div>`;
