You might insist that your dented car bumper is <i>unrelated</i> to your neighbor's smashed mailbox.</p><p class="long">Things that have no connection are unrelated: your excellent test grade is unrelated to the shoes your wore on the day you took it, and your inability remember the name of the movie you just watched is unrelated to the fact that the sun is shining. You can also describe two people who aren't in the same family as <i>unrelated</i>. The Latin root is <i>relatus</i>, a past participle of <i>referre</i>, "bring back."</p></div></div>`;
