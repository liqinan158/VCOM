When you get right to the point in a conversation, you speak <i>baldly</i>.</p><p class="long">People who state their feelings baldly sometimes get a shocked response from others, since they tend to simply say exactly what they mean rather than adding detail or explanations. The adverb <i>baldly</i> comes from the sense of the adjective <i>bald</i> that means "plain or blunt," a meaning that comes from the "plainness" of a <i>bald</i> — or hairless — head.</p></div>`;
