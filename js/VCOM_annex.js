A small room off of a main room is an <i>annex,</i> and attics are another type of annex.</p><p class="long">As a noun, an <i>annex</i> is part of a building or an addition to a main structure, or it can be an attachment, as in "an annex to the current plans." When used as a verb, the word means something a little different. Sometimes <i>annex</i> is used as a nice word for "take" or "grab," as when Nazi Germany took the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia in 1938 and added it to their own territory. In order to <i>annex</i> something to what is yours, you have to take it away from someone else.</p></div>`;
