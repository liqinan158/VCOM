If you're an <i>apologist</i> for deep sea oil drilling, you would argue that drilling in the ocean is necessary and the benefits make up for any environmental damage.</p><p class="long"><i>Apologists</i> tend to be seen in a negative light, as defensive people who make excuses. The word <i>apologist</i> comes from the Greek word <i>apologia</i>, meaning "speaking in defense." Not all <i>apologists</i> are bad news; some just defend an unpopular idea. Even though <i>apologist</i> is similar to <i>apology,</i> don't confuse them â€” if you make an <i>apology</i> you're admitting to being wrong. But if you're an <i>apologist</i>, you justify your belief or action, and would do it all again!</p></div></div>`;
