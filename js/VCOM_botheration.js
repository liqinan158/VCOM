This folksy word can apply to anything that bugs you, like getting up early or stubbing your toe. When things are bothering you, you're in a state of botheration, which is like irritation or vexation. One form of botheration usually leads to the other: the more botherations (annoyances) in your life, the greater your botheration (state of annoyance).</p></div>`;
