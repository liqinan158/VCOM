var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">appertain</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the verb <i>appertain</i> when you need a formal way to say "officially concern." For example, you could argue, "Those mall rules don't <i>appertain</i> to me and my skateboard."</p><p class="long">You're most likely to see the word <i>appertain</i> followed by "to," meaning "apply to" or "relate to." Your parents' instructions, for example, appertain to you and your sisters; and passport laws appertain to any citizen who wants to travel to foreign countries. A closely related word is <i>pertain</i>, which has a similar but less formal or official meaning. Both words come from the Latin <i>pertinere</i>, "to relate, have reference to, or be applicable."</p></div></div>`;
