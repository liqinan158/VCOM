It can also mean "done without thinking," or "lacking understanding," so a senseless student will give the teacher a blank look when their name is called, and a hiking trip across the Rockies in the winter would be senseless too. The "unconscious" meaning is the oldest, dating from the 1550s.</p></div>`;
