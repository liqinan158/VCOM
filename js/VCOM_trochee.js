The song "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" is composed of <i>trochees</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>trochee</i> goes back to the Greek phrase <i>trokhaios pous</i>, "a running foot," and this sense of motion and forward momentum translates to its literary meaning. A poem's meter — the number and type of metrical feet used in each line — determines its shape and rhythm. Since ancient times, writing that uses trochees has been thought of as more energetic and spirited than its opposite, iambic rhythm, although iambs are more common in English.</p></div></div>`;
