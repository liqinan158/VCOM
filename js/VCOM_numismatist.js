It literally means "someone who studies coins." These aren't the coins you have in your pocket right now. Instead, a numismatist studies and collects coins from other places and time periods. The word comes from the Latin word <i>numisma</i>, meaning "coin, currency." The word <i>numismatist</i> was coined — no pun intended! — in 1799.</p></div></div>`;
