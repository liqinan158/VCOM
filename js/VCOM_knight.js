If a king decides to <i>knight</i> you, that means the king wants to make you into a <i>knight</i>.</p><p class="long">Real life knights havenâ€™t been around since the Middle Ages, which ended around 600 years ago. These days <i>knight</i> is an honorary title awarded by nations with royal families like the UK. These nations will knight anyone they think is deserving from a rock star to a politician. More casually, you can use <i>knight</i> to describe anyone who acts chivalrously, or bravely. If you are rescued from a burning building, you might call your rescuer, a "knight in shining armor."</p></div>`;
