If your friend spends fifteen minutes searching for her lost sunglasses, only to find them on top of her head, you can call her an <i>airhead</i>.</p><p class="long">While the most popular meaning of <i>airhead</i> is "scatterbrain" or "dingbat," the formal definition of this noun is quite different. <i>Airhead</i> is a military term for a base inside hostile territory where supplies and troops can be kept, and from where soldiers can more safely fly in and out of the area. This 1950s-era meaning comes from the form of the military term <i>beachhead</i> â€” the slang term is from the 1970s.</p></div>`;
