A children's book that is sweet and sentimental, illustrated with squirrels in little dresses, could be described as <i>twee</i>.</p><p class="long">You could call a flowery hat twee, or describe an elaborate tea party, complete with lacy napkins, fancy silverware, and dressed-up guests, as twee. The word is traditionally British, and its original meaning could have described a dollhouse: "tiny, dainty, or miniature." Much as <i>tummy</i> comes from <i>stomach</i>, twee stems from the (overly adorable) way a child might pronounce the word <i>sweet</i>.</p></div>`;
