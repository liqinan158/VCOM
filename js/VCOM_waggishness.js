This characteristic of snappy humor is vital to practical jokers and class clowns.</p><p class="long">Waggishness is a common trait of sitcom characters and teasing uncles â€” it's a good-humored playfulness that's just a tiny bit snarky or sharp. Though this noun is rarely used today, it's still a great way to describe someone's specific brand of humor. It comes from the old-fashioned noun <i>wag</i>, "person fond of making jokes."</p></div></div>`;
