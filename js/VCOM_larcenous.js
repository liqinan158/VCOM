You can describe a classmate as <i>larcenous</i> if she proudly shows off the candy she's stolen from the corner store.</p><p class="long">Pickpockets, car thieves, and politicians who accept bribes are all larcenous â€” they are all motivated by a desire for financial gain and a willingness to take things that don't belong to them. This adjective comes from <i>larceny</i>, a fancy way to say "theft." Both words have their roots in the Latin <i>latrocinium</i>, "robbery," which comes from <i>latro</i>, "robber or bandit."</p></div>`;
