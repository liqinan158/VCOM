Here, <i>diametrically</i> is used to mean "totally" or "completely."</p><p class="long"><i>Diametrically</i> is an unusual word â€” it's only used to modify the adjective <i>opposed</i>. When you describe two things that couldn't be more different from each other, you can say they're diametrically opposed. Is your brother a cheerful, optimistic person, while your sister is cranky and gloomy? Then they're diametrically opposed. This word comes from <i>diameter</i>, a line through a circle, in the sense that two points at either end of a diameter are directly opposite each other.</p></div>`;
