If your expensive meal doesn't taste very good, you could say its quality is <i>incommensurate</i> with its cost.</p><p class="long">Things that are incommensurate just don't match â€” they're disproportionate or off-kilter. Your little brother's loud mouth might be incommensurate with his tiny size, and your small appetite could be incommensurate with the enormous banana split in front of you. The <i>commensurate</i> part of this word comes from the Late Latin <i>commensuratus</i>, literally "measured with," or "equal," and the prefix <i>in-</i> means "not."</p></div></div>`;
