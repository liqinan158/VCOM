This means you have become accustomed to tolerating them.</p><p class="long">This adjective is derived from the 16th-century phrase <i>in ure,</i> meaning “in use” or “in practice.” When you are inured to something, you have probably had a lot of persistent exposure to it, and it’s usually something negative. People can become inured to pain, inured to violence, and even inured to the sound of a little yappy dog that won’t stop barking.</p></div>`;
