Maybe that's because the word was coined in the 1880s as a combination of <i>hummer</i> and <i>dinger</i>, two words for people or things that are big, strong, powerful, or just awesome. By the early 1900s, <i>humdingers</i> were everywhere, at least according to the salesmen, college boys, and other slang-slingers whose penchant for exaggerated boosterism made <i>humdinger</i> what it is today.</p></div>`;
