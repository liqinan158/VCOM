Of course, some people only use the term as an exaggeration, claiming that their parents' requirement that they write thank you notes after their birthdays is a heinous form of torture.</p><p class="long"><i>Heinous</i> descends from Middle English, from Old French <i>haineus</i>, from <i>haine</i> "hatred," from <i>hair</i> "to hate." So when you want to use the word heinous in all seriousness, think of acts that are considered hateful (or outrageous, and shocking). Think: treason, torture, the clubbing of baby seals. <i>Heinous</i> is pronounced HĀ-nəs.</p></div></div>`;
