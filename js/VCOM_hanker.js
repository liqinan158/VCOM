On a hot, sunny afternoon, you might <i>hanker</i> for a tall glass of sweet iced tea.</p><p class="long">People often hanker for relatively meaningless things, like chocolate cake or a nap or a new pair of shoes, but you can also hanker after more important things, like a long-lost friend or a new job. If you long for it, you hanker for it. The word's origin is a little fuzzy, but one good guess traces it to the Middle Dutch <i>hangen</i>, "to hang," from the idea of "hanging around" or "lingering."</p></div></div>`;
