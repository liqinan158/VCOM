If a kindergarten teacher keeps a list of whose turn it is be the line leader, updating it daily, that's an <i>unarbitrary</i> method of giving everyone a turn.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>unarbitrary</i> is formed by adding the prefix <i>un-</i> ("not") to <i>arbitrary</i>, which means "done at random." So when you do something in a methodical way, on on purpose, it's unarbitrary. Instead of letting friends arbitrarily take a swing at the piñata, letting them fight over control over the bat, find an unarbitrary way to do it. Perhaps you'll decide to have them line up in alphabetical order.</p></div></div>`;
