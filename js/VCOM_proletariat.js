It was commonly used by Marxists and other people who believed that capitalism had created a class of workers who were exploited by company owners. They called those owners "the bourgeoisie."</p><p class="long">When you use the word <i>proletariat</i> now, your audience might assume that you've arrived in a time machine from the 19th century and you're still angry about  the exploitation of workers. So you probably would use the term self-consciously or humorously, as in “The boss just sent around a memo saying no one’s allowed to leave until we’ve finished compiling the report. I guess the <i>proletariat</i> had better forget about making it home in time to watch the kick-off.”</p></div></div>`;
