var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">exorcise</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>exorcise</i> is to cast out a devil or evil spirit, using prayer and other religious tools. You're probably familiar with the name of the person who does this: an exorcist. Don't try to <i>exorcise</i> a demon yourself. Call an exorcist.</p><p class="long">One way to remember the word <i>exorcise</i> is that it sounds like "exercise," which means to work out or train your body or mind. Casting out devils is hard work, so be sure to exercise before you exorcise. A boxer doesn't box without exercising first. And an exorcist doesn't exorcise without getting ready first either. The devil is a tough opponent, so you'd better get warmed up before you try to exorcise him from that little girl.</p></div>`;
