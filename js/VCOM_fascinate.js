If you catch someone's interest, and then hold it, you <i>fascinate</i> them. Be careful.</p><p class="long">The word <i>fascinate</i> actually comes from Latin and French words meaning "witchcraft," and although these days <i>fascinate</i> is used under much tamer circumstances, there is some sense in the word that the person's appeal is not quite normal: there might be a spell-like quality to his or her charms. Thus, the word is often used to describe a new love. On the other hand, you might find the study of exotic beetles fascinating. To each his own.</p></div></div>`;
