If you are eating at a diner, your <i>place mat</i> is probably made of paper and covered in ads. If you are a kid, your <i>place mat</i> is probably made of plastic to protect it from your spilled milk.</p><p class="long">Some tables are set with only a tablecloth, while others might have individual place mats instead of (or in addition to) a tablecloth. When you set the kitchen table for a tea party, you might carefully arrange place settings on a fancy place mat for each of your guests. Place mats come in different materials, shapes, and sizes — although they're most commonly a rectangular piece of soft fabric — but they're intended to keep the table tidy and protected. At a casual restaurant, you might have a paper place mat printed with the menu, or with games meant to entertain children.</p></div></div>`;
