A kitten's fur and your favorite fleece pajama pants are <i>soft</i>. So is spreadable cheese or the spongy ground of a wet field.</p><p class="long">A soft voice is gentle, and a soft light or color is subdued or muted. A table with soft edges is rounded instead of sharp-cornered. Soft rain is mild. No matter how the adjective <i>soft</i> is used, it's always the opposite of words like <i>hard</i>, <i>loud</i>, <i>bright</i> or <i>stubborn</i>. It comes from a Germanic root that means "level, even, smooth, or gentle."</p></div>`;
