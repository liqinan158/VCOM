If there were a <i>repudiation</i> of all the math test scores because of widespread cheating, you'd probably have to take the test again.</p><p class="long"><i>Repudiation</i> comes from the verb "repudiate," which is rooted in the Latin word <i>repudiare</i>, meaning to divorce or reject. If you show something is false, you have made a <i>repudiation</i> of that thing. Until the repudiation of the claims, people thought that heroin was a harmless ingredient that could help ease a cough. General belief in the safety of cocaine and cigarettes had similar repudiations.</p></div></div>`;
