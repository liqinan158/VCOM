If there's too much <i>gristle</i> in your steak, you might send it back â€” or think seriously about becoming a vegetarian.</p><p class="long">Gristle is an unpleasant surprise in a bite of meat, a fibrous bit you may end up spitting in your napkin. It makes sense you can't chew it, since gristle is a type of connective tissue that's mainly found in ligaments and doesn't break down when it's cooked. Skilled cooks can easily cut out any gristle before cooking meat. In Old English, <i>gristle</i> simply meant "cartilage."</p></div>`;
