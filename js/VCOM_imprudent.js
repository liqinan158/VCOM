Remember that? Everybody else does.</p><p class="long"><i>Prudent</i> means "wise or shrewd," but add the prefix <i>im-</i> meaning "not," suddenly you have an adjective that describes the opposite of being wise or shrewd. An <i>imprudent</i> person doesn't think about the consequences and might cross the street without looking both ways or use a curling iron while taking a bath. Careless, wild, imprudent behavior can get you into big trouble!</p></div></div>`;
