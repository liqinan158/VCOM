Like a parabola and an ellipse, a <i>hyperbola</i> is a kind of conic section, which is formed when a flat plane intersects a double cone.</p><p class="long">A hyperbola is a smooth plane curve, the curved line formed when a plane (a flat surface with no thickness) cuts through a double cone's base. When a spacecraft alters its course, using the Earth's gravity to propel it out into space, its orbit forms a hyperbola. This word is easy to confuse with <i>hyperbole</i>, or "exaggeration," and the two actually share a Greek root, also <i>hyperbole</i>, "extravagance" or "a throwing beyond."</p></div></div>`;
