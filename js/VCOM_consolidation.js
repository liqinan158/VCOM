This could be smaller businesses joining together or the <i>consolidation</i> of debt, as in combining three credit card payments into one. Anywhere there’s <i>consolidation,</i> there’s merging, joining, and combining.</p><p class="long">You can see the word <i>solid </i> at the heart of <i>consolidation</i>, and its Latin roots will tell you that it means “to make solid together.” The goal of consolidation is really just that, to combine things in order to make them stronger or more beneficial. If you’re good at art and your friend is good at science, you may want to form a consolidation to take the science fair by storm.</p></div></div>`;
