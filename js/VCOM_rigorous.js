A <i>rigorous</i> inspection of your tax records has revealed the government owes you money. Congratulations!</p><p class="long">The Latin root for <i>rigorous</i> is <i>rigor</i>, meaning “stiffness.” This might remind you of <i>rigor mortis</i>, the stiffening of a body after death, as often seen on cop shows. This is a good, if creepy, way of remembering the meaning of <i>rigorous</i>: rigorous people are stiff and unbending about the standards of their work. This requires being alive, of course.</p></div>`;
