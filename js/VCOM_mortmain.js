A church's property is often protected by a <i>mortmain</i>. <i>Mortmain</i> literally means “dead hand.”</p><p class="long">The noun <i>mortmain</i> is primarily a legal term, describing a kind of protection of a group's hold on property or land. Historically, buildings and land owned by a church organization would have a mortmain to protect the church against losing the property even after the death of the person in charge. In Old French, <i>mortemain</i> literally means "dead hand," from the Medieval Latin <i>manus mortua</i>, which in legal terms means "inalienable power."</p></div>`;
