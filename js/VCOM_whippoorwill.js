The speckled brown whippoorwill has a somewhat flat head â€” it resembles a small owl. Its name can also be spelled "whip-poor-will," and it is onomatopoeic; in other words, the name mimics the sound the bird makes. Some New England and Native American folk tales cite the whippoorwill as an omen of death, possibly because of its haunting song.</p></div></div>`;
