A professional wrestler, with his over-developed, muscular body, has machismo, and so does a tough Marine who believes that real men never cry. <i>Machismo</i> comes from the word <i>macho</i>, which in Spanish simply means "male," but in English has had connotations of machismo since the 1920s, when it was first used to mean "tough guy."</p></div></div>`;
