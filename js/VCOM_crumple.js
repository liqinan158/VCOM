Your face might <i>crumple</i> over time as you age, or you might <i>crumple</i> a piece of paper before tossing it in the trash.</p><p class="long"><i>Crumple</i> comes from the Old English word <i>crump</i> meaning "bent, crooked," and it can describe something that has buckled or collapsed. If you're jumping up and down on a cardboard box, it'll eventually crumple under your weight and fold in on itself. Make sure you don't confuse <i>crumple</i> with the similar looking <i>crumble</i>, which means to break apart into small fragments. If you crumple something, it stays in one piece â€” it's just wrinkled or folded.</p></div></div>`;
