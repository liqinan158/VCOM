The rules might be religious, philosophical, or made-up, but <i>dogmatic</i> people would never waver in their beliefs so don’t even think of trying to change their minds.</p><p class="long"><i>Dogmatic</i> goes back to the Greek words <i>dogma</i>, which means basically “what one thinks is true” and <i>dogmatikos</i>, “pertaining to doctrine.” To be dogmatic is to follow a doctrine relating to morals and faith, a set of beliefs that is passed down and never questioned. It also refers to arrogant opinions based on unproven theories or even despite facts. Someone dogmatic might insist that dinosaurs never existed or that women shouldn’t drive. Dogmatic people are usually not very popular.</p></div></div>`;
