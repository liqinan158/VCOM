var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">unchecked</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If something isn't held back or restrained, it's <i>unchecked</i>, like the <i>unchecked</i> growth of the weeds in your neighbor's garden.</p><p class="long">Use <i>unchecked</i> to describe things that are increasing or growing, especially if they're unwanted. The unchecked sprawl of a city might result in the loss of animal habitats, and your class's unchecked chatter will eventually make it impossible for you to hear the teacher when he tries to get your attention. This word comes from the verb <i>check</i>, "to hold or control," the way you control your opponent's king in a game of chess by putting it in check.</p></div></div>`;
