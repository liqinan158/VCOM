You might admire the way the morning sun glints against the <i>slanted</i> metal roof of your barn.</p><p class="long">A skateboard ramp is slanted, and so is the entire side of an A-frame house. When something is angled in a slant or diagonal, it's slanted. Another meaning of the adjective is "biased," or "one-sided." Slanted news coverage, for example, only gives you one perspective on a controversial subject, rather than the whole picture. The verb <i>slant</i> comes from the sixteenth century word <i>slenten</i>, or "slip sideways."</p></div></div>`;
