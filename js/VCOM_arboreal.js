Monkeys that live in trees are <i>arboreal</i>. The rings of a tree are an indication of <i>arboreal</i> age.</p><p class="long">The word <i>arboreal</i> comes from the Latin <i>arboreus</i>, which means "pertaining to trees." It's a word that refers not just to animals that live in trees, but also to anything that resembles the branching form of a tree â€” like a chandelier or a family geology drawn out. It even can be used to describe, as its Latin root suggests, something pertaining to trees. A Christmas tree shop is an arboreal wonderland. There are trees everywhere!</p></div>`;
