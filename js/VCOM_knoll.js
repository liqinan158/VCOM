Kennedy, who was shot in Dallas just as his motorcade passed a grassy <i>knoll</i>. At first people thought that was where the shots had come from, but it was later determined that the assassin had fired from a nearby building instead. The "grassy <i>knoll</i>‚Äù became symbolic of a theory that others had participated in the assassination, and the term has become shorthand for any conspiracy theory.</p></div>`;
