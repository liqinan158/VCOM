If you've spotted a fox every day for the last week, you might say, "I've seen so many foxes <i>lately</i>!"</p><p class="long">If your friend says, "I've been really stressed out <i>lately</i>," she means she's been overworked and tense for the past few days, weeks, or possibly months. <i>Lately</i> is an adverb that covers the immediate past, a period of time that wasn't too long ago. A more old-fashioned way to say <i>lately</i> is "of late." Though this word has had its current meaning since the fifteenth century, it originally meant "slow or sluggish."</p></div></div>`;
