A major goal of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement of the 20th century was <i>desegregation</i>.</p><p class="long">When you <i>segregate</i> one group of people, you deliberately keep them separate or apart from others. During much of America's history, there has been a policy of segregating African Americans in society â€” at various times, segregation has existed in the military, housing, jobs, education, and many other areas. Desegregation has attempted to remove this division and to integrate people of all races into the general community. The Latin root is <i>segregatus</i>, "set apart," or "separate from the flock."</p></div></div>`;
