When something is said in <i>unison</i>, two or more voices sound like one.</p><p class="long"><i>Unison</i> comes from the Latin root words <i>uni</i>, meaning "one," and <i>sonous</i>, meaning "sound." So <i>unison</i> literally means one sound, and in music, it still retains that meaning. Unison occurs when two or more people play or sing the same pitch or in octaves. Outside of music, you may have experienced unison speaking when your class recites something together or unison movement when a group performs a dance routine.</p></div></div>`;
