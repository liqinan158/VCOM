Even when doctors give them a biologically inactive drug, otherwise known as a <i>placebo</i>, the patients swear they are cured.</p><p class="long">In clinical drug-trials, to rule out what is called the <i>placebo</i> effect, scientists give half of the trial participants a placebo. If a government replaces food stamps with a coloring book give-away, it might be dismissed by child advocates as nothing more than a placebo. <i>Placēbō</i> is Latin for "I'll please (you)," in other words, I'll keep you happy, even though I'm just giving you a placebo.</p></div>`;
