And it's different from a mainstream movie with a few sex scenes. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously said about porn, "I'll know it when I see it." People can also use the word <i>porn</i> to describe anything singular in focus that's meant to stir the senses: food porn, for example, features endless, excessive pictures of amazing looking food.</p></div></div>`;
