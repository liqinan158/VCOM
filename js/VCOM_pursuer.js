You could be a <i>pursuer</i> of truth and beauty, or perhaps a <i>pursuer</i> of the kid who took your lunch money.</p><p class="long">To pursue is to chase something, like a dog pursuing a squirrel. In that situation, the dog is a pursuer. Someone whoâ€™s trying to ask someone else out on a date is a pursuer. When the police are on a manhunt for a criminal, the police are pursuers. You could also say someone is a pursuer of a goal, like a pursuer of a medical degree. All pursuers want something and they're going after it.</p></div>`;
