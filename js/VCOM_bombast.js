If your football coach is known for his <i>bombast</i>, he probably gives a pompous speech before each game about the greatness of the team and, of course, his coaching.</p><p class="long">Originally, <i>bombast</i> was cotton padding used to stuff or pad things like seat cushions. The meaning was extended to include padded and overstuffed speaking or writing, especially speech that's pretentious and showy. Other words with <i>bombast</i> at their roots include the adjective <i>bombastic</i> and the adverb <i>bombastically</i>. For all your coach's bluster and bombast, he's a pretty nice guy â€” too bad his overblown rhetoric turns people off before they get to know him.</p></div>`;
