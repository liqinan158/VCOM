Your dog's <i>fickleness</i> might mean she loves you best today, but your brother will be her favorite tomorrow.</p><p class="long">A person's fickleness tends to make them unreliable â€” they're not someone you can count on, since they are so inconsistent. You can also use this noun for anything that changes unpredictably, like the climate: "The weather's fickleness in September meant they decided to have the party indoors." <i>Fickleness</i> comes from the adjective <i>fickle</i> and its Old English root meaning "cunning or tricky."</p></div>`;
