This might involve simply admitting you've done something wrong, or being punished or scolded by an authority figure. There are a few theories about where this phrase came from, including a military origin â€” at one time, military officers were "drummed out" in disgrace after committing offenses. Another possible source is the idea of stage actors facing the orchestra when they walked on stage.</p></div>`;
