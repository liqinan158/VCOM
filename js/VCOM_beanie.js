It was fashionable for boys to wear <i>beanies</i> in the first half of the 20th century.</p><p class="long">Traditionally, a beanie was a flat, close-fitting hat without a brim, sometimes also called a <i>skullcap</i>. In the early 1900s, adult workers and young men commonly wore beanies, which eventually evolved into today's baseball cap. The hat was probably named <i>beanie</i> after the bean-sized, cloth-covered button in the center of the cap. In the UK, a <i>beanie</i> is simply a knitted stocking cap.</p></div>`;
