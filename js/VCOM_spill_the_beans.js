If your friend warns you not to <i>spill the beans</i>, it means she doesn't want you to tell anyone her secret.</p><p class="long">You might, for example, spill the beans about the surprise party your sister was planning for your dad â€” and then worry that your sister is going to be furious. While <i>spill</i> seems to have been used since the sixteenth century to mean "divulge," the phrase <i>spill the beans</i> comes from the early twentieth century United States. In addition to beans, early versions had people spilling both soup and guts.</p></div>`;
