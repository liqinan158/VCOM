You might recognize this root in related words like <i>mutate</i>, <i>mutable</i>, and <i>mutant</i>. We often think of mutations as changes in an animal's genetic structure, but there are other kinds of mutations. For example, if an architect designs an award-winning building, her later designs that are similar might be called mutations of that one.</p></div></div>`;
