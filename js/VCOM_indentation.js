If you take a hammer to a piece of metal, you will make a series of <i>indentations.</i></p><p class="long">The <i>dent</i> in <i>indentation</i> shares a root with your <i>dentist</i>, and an <i>indentation</i> is basically like a tooth mark. Except some "teeth" are larger than others — a meteorite leaves a huge indentation in the ground, just as a sharp pencil could make a tiny indentation in your finger. You can talk about conceptual indentation, too. Loving the novel <i>Anna Karenina</i> might make an indentation in your general aversion to reading. It’s that’s good.</p></div>`;
