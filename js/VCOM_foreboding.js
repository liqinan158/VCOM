A <i>foreboding</i> is a glimpse or a feeling that bad things are going to happen. It's a premonition, or look into the future. Most times <i>foreboding</i> implies that something evil is coming, but sometimes it's used for anything bad up ahead, as in "she had a foreboding that the trip would get canceled due to the hurricane." Even if the future looks bright, a foreboding casts dread over what's ahead.</p></div></div>`;
