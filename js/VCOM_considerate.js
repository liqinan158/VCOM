People like it when you're <i>considerate</i> of their feelings.</p><p class="long">We could all probably be more considerate of others: this word means you're thinking of other people — considering them — and then treating them decently and with respect. It's considerate to say "please" and "thank you" to people. It's considerate to excuse yourself, rather than walking out and slamming the door. Asking someone how they feel is usually considerate. A considerate person is kind and thoughtful — a good person to know.</p></div></div>`;
