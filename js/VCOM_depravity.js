To deprave is to make something bad, often to the point of moral corruption, like the parental fear that a bad influence will deprave their good kids. So, depravity is behavior that is morally corrupt or otherwise deemed wicked. Don't confuse <i>depravity</i> with <i>deprivation</i>, meaning "being denied something that is necessary."</p></div>`;
