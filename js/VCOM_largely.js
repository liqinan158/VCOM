You might say that you're <i>largely</i> pleased with the way your favorite baseball team played this season if they won more games than they lost.</p><p class="long">If a group art project was largely completed at your house, that means you primarily worked on it there, and when a once-popular novelist is largely forgotten, she's generally fallen out of favor with today's readers. <i>Largely</i> is a useful alternative to "mostly," "mainly," or "chiefly," and it comes from the adjective <i>large</i>, in Old French "broad, wide, or generous," from a Latin root, <i>largus</i>, "abundant, plentiful, bountiful, or liberal."</p></div></div>`;
