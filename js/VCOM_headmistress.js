You might need to ask the <i>headmistress</i> of your high school for a college recommendation.</p><p class="long">Private schools and prep schools often call the person in charge a <i>headmaste</i> if he's a man and a <i>headmistress</i> if she's a woman. It's more common to have a principal in the United States, especially in public schools. The word <i>headmistress</i> is commonly thought of as British, but it's increasingly likely that a British student will use the term <i>head teacher</i> instead, since it can refer to either a man or a woman.</p></div>`;
