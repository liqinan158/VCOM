You are violating a belief held sacred, at least by some individuals.</p><p class="long"><i>Sacrilege</i> has its roots in the Latin <i>sacr-</i>, meaning "holy." <i>Sacrilege</i> was originally reserved for talking about blasphemous acts that disrespect, violate, or misuse holy traditions or objects. However, today the term <i>sacrilege</i> carries a broader, and lighter, meaning than its origins suggest. For example, it's usually considered sacrilege to root for the out-of-town team that's playing against your home team. Ancient users of this word might think our looser definition is <i>sacrilege</i>.</p></div></div>`;
