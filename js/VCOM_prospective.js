If you’re contemplating your future, you might speak of your prospective career, your prospective spouse, or a prospective million-dollar offer to make a movie based on your fascinating life. However, avoid the common mistake of confusing <i>prospective</i> with <i>perspective</i>. <i>Perspective</i>, which can mean “a reasonable point of view,” is important when one wants to accurately assess prospective opportunities.</p></div>`;
