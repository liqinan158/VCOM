Which is just a scientific way of saying "make a really good educated guess."</p><p class="long">Ok, so when someone <i>hypothesizes</i> there's a little bit more involved than just guesswork. It involves using your past knowledge and available facts to try and predict what might happen. Scientists hypothesize all the time â€” it's the basis for every experiment. For example, doctors examining a werewolf might hypothesize that his furry face and oddball behavior stem from an illness and not the full moon.</p></div>`;
