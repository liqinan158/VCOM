An <i>exhortation</i> is a loud or enthusiastic urging.</p><p class="long">Use an <i>exhortation</i> any time you really want to encourage someone to do something. It's a way of communicating that's persuasive and powerful â€” an exhortation might come from a government in the form of a speech encouraging people to get flu shots, or it might be a teacher urging his students to sit quietly. Whether it comes in the form of a warning or encouragement, an exhortation strongly advises people to take some particular action.</p></div>`;
