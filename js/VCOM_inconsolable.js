When someone is inconsolable, theyâ€™re so upset that all the words and hugs in the world are ineffective. An inconsolable person can't be consoled. People are inconsolable after horrible things happen, like the death of a family member or a friend. Some people are inconsolable after losing their jobs or suffering disappointments. If you're depressed, you could be inconsolable. This is a strong word for extreme sadness.</p></div>`;
