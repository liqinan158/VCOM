Boys and men and male animals all have <i>penises</i>.</p><p class="long">Kids and teens often giggle at the word <i>penis</i>, but it's just a word for a body part like "arm" or "leg." Well, a penis is a little different, since it's the organ males use for sex and urinating. Some men take a lot of pride in their penis, which in slang is most often called a <i>dick</i>. However, if you're talking about a dick with a parent or teacher, or you're writing about one in a paper, <i>penis</i> is the word you want to use.</p></div></div>`;
