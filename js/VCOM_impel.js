A person sleep walking might move as if <i>impelled</i> by a force beyond their control. Loneliness might <i>impel</i> you to talk to someone you don't know.</p><p class="long"><i>Impel</i> derives from the Latin <i>in-</i> "toward" + <i>pellere</i> "to drive," which also brings us <i>compel</i> "to force" and <i>propel</i> "to drive forward." The boy was propelled by his fears, but when he said fear of bullies impelled him to stay home on Halloween, his mother compelled him to dress and go outside.</p></div>`;
