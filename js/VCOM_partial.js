var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">partial</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If you describe something as <i>partial</i>, you're usually saying it's just part of the whole, or incomplete.  Say someone asks how you started your band and you say, "I bought a guitar." That would be a <i>partial</i> answer, at best.</p><p class="long"><i>Partial</i> has another meaning, too.  If you say you are <i>partial</i> to something, you are expressing a fondness for it. Or not.  If someone asks you whether you still love your husband after 50 years of marriage, for example, and you say, "I'm <i>partial</i> to him," you're either joking or politely saying "Not really."  Being partial to something is to love as a warm stove is to a bonfire.</p></div>`;
