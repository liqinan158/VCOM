Discriminating against Jews is an example of <i>antisemitism</i>.</p><p class="long">The Jews are also known as Semitic people, and the culture and qualities of Jews are known as Semitism. Place the prefix <i>anti-</i> (meaning "against") in front of <i>semitism</i>, and you get a noun describing actions taken against Jews. Antisemitism is an ugly thing, similar to racism or sexism. Unfortunately, antisemitism has been one of the strongest forms of hatred in the history of the world, as seen in events like the Holocaust, in which Nazi Germany killed six millions Jews.</p></div>`;
