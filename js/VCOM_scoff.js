People have <i>scoffed</i> at many great inventors, saying their products would flop because the public wouldn't be interested in things like the light bulb, the personal computer, or the pet rock.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>scoff</i> is often followed by the word <i>at</i> ("<i>scoff</i> at the idea, <i>scoff</i> at the statement, <i>scoff</i> at the notion"). The verb can also mean to treat with contempt or to mock. Naysayers scoff at all kinds of theories, and grouchy old men tend to scoff for the heck of it.</p></div>`;
