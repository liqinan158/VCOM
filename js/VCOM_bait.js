When you hold a yard sale, place your best stuff closest to the sidewalk — to serve as <i>bait</i>. <i>Bait</i> can be anything from the worms that hide a hook to a stereo that tempts shoppers to stop and browse.</p><p class="long"><i>Bait</i> can also mean the act of getting someone or something to do what you want. For generations, students have baited their teachers into wasting class time with a question about a personal interest or obsession: “This talk about integers is very fascinating, Mr. Green, but what do you think about last night’s Penguins game?” <i>Bait</i> comes from the Old Norse, word <i>beita</i> — “to cause to bite.” Asking Mr. Green what other Viking words he knows might be interesting, and provide bait for his next off-topic musing.</p></div>`;
