If you tell your sister that you'll be at her house <i>presently</i>, you mean that you're on your way.</p><p class="long">You might say that the cookies you just put in the oven will be done presently, or describe how you were so sleepy last night that you opened a book and presently fell asleep, before you could read a single page. <i>Presently</i> also means "right now," as when you say that the temperature outside is presently thirty degrees. This is the older of the two meanings â€” a fourteenth-century sense of "at present" gradually changed to include "sooner or later."</p></div></div>`;
