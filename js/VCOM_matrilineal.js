To follow the <i>matrilineal</i> line in your family, start with your mom.</p><p class="long">In Latin, <i>matri-</i> refers to the mother, just as <i>patri-</i> refers to the father. <i>Lineal</i> is a word that refers to someone's <i>lineage</i>, or the line of people that came before that person; so the adjective <i>matrilineal</i> describes anything related to kinship through a female line. If the children in your culture take their mother's last name, and not their father's, this is a matrilineal tradition.</p></div></div>`;
