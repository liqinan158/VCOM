If your friend starts saying strange things you don't understand, ask her why she's suddenly become <i>peculiar</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Peculiar</i> comes from the Latin <i>peculiaris</i>, meaning one's own, or personal.  In English, it originally meant belonging to one person, private, like your fondness for your peculiar hairbrush.  It also had the meaning of something unlike others, special, or remarkable. Eventually we mostly stopped using it for belongings,  instead using <i>peculiar</i> to mean unusual or odd.</p></div></div>`;
