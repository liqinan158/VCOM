Nowadays it is used more figuratively to mean any kind of path someone makes.</p><p class="long">The figurative use of <i>swath</i> has nonphysical senses as well, as in the term "a significant <i>swath</i> of the population believes..." Or if someone is trying to attract attention to themselves, or is making quite a public stir, they might be said to be "cutting a <i>swath</i> through the business world" or "cutting a <i>swath</i> on the dance floor." Hopefully, neither of the latter involves using scythes.</p></div></div>`;
