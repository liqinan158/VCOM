This construction means that <i>plywood</i> is very strong and resistant to chipping or warping.</p><p class="long">There are many kinds of plywood, and even more ways to use it. Plywood made from soft woods is used for sub-flooring in new homes and packaging of various kinds. Harder plywood can be made into furniture, walls, cabinets, stereo speakers, and sports equipment. The layers (or <i>plies</i>) in a piece of plywood are glued together with the grain direction alternating, which makes it sturdy even when it's thin.</p></div>`;
