Plate tectonics studies earthquakes, how mountains are formed, and other surface features of our lovely planet.</p><p class="long">In the 1960’s, plate tectonics revolutionized the way scientists think about how the continents used to fit together and how the surface of the earth continues to shift. Plate tectonics looks at the faults, folds, and the movements of the earth's surface plates. Plate tectonics is helpful in predicting earthquakes, because quakes usually happen along the edges of the plates, just like when you smash your dinner plate up against your brother’s.</p></div></div>`;
