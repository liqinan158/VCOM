It's a verb! It's a word that <i>warrants</i> our attention! As a noun, it's the piece of paper they show you through the keyhole during an investigation. It's also a reason for doing something, or a promise (think of the <i>warranty</i> on your new car, the promise that it'll work for a certain amount of time). As a verb, it means to make something seem reasonable or necessary, such as when the ticking suitcase <i>warrants</i> bringing in the bomb squad, or when the teenager's sneaking in late again <i>warrants</i> a stricter curfew.</p></div>`;
