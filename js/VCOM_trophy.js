Often made of metal (or plastic meant to look like metal), a <i>trophy</i> may not have much monetary value, but the pride it gives the person who receives it can be priceless.</p><p class="long"><i>Trophy</i> comes from the Greek word <i>tropē</i>, meaning "a turning, defeat of the enemy." It later came to mean "a monument of victory," which it still celebrates today. Think of the overjoyed actor who holds his Oscar — a trophy — in the air during his acceptance speech, or a team of eight year old soccer players who, in their group photo, hold their trophies in one hand while raising the index finger of their other hand, meaning "We're number one!"</p></div></div>`;
