A movie on a long bus ride — even a bad movie — is <i>diverting</i>.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>diverting</i> describes anything that grabs your attention, especially if it's entertaining and distracts from something less interesting. Spending time with a friend can be diverting when you're waiting to hear important news or get the results of a big test, and a good, diverting book is the perfect thing to take on a boring train commute. <i>Diverting</i> stems from the verb <i>divert</i>, or "distract," from its Latin root, <i>divertere</i>, "to turn in different directions."</p></div></div>`;
