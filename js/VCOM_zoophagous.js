Bears, wolves, and sharks can all be described as <i>zoophagous</i>.</p><p class="long">It is much more common to use the adjective <i>carnivorous</i> to describe a meat-eating animal, but if you come across <i>zoophagous</i> in a science textbook, you'll know what it means. Animals that are zoophagous eat animals or animal matter, so everything from lions to parasites can be described this way. The word combines the roots <i>zoo</i>, from the Greek <i>zoion</i>, "animal or living being," and <i>-phagous</i>, "eating or feeding on," from the Greek <i>phagein</i>, "to eat."</p></div>`;
