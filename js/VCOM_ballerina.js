Historically, the term <i>ballerina</i> was saved for the very best female solo dancers in a ballet company, similar to the word <i>diva</i> in opera. In French, you call a female dancer a <i>danseuse</i>, and while the word <i>ballerina</i> means "dancing girl" in Italian, it's more accepted to use the word <i>danzatrice</i> in Italy.</p></div></div>`;
