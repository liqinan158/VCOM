Shoveling your neighbor's sidewalk all winter could be your <i>penance</i> for not helping rake the leaves that dropped from your tree into his yard during the fall.</p><p class="long">Although the noun <i>penance</i> can mean any remorse for past mistakes, or any voluntary action meant to right the wrong, <i>Penance</i>, with a capital <i>P</i>, also specifically refers to a sacrament in the Catholic Church. When a person receives Penance, he or she confesses sins to a priest, and along with a blessing, receives an order to do something, such as say certain prayers. This assignment is also called penance.</p></div></div>`;
