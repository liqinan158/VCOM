When you are <i>accommodating</i> someone, you are making room for them or special circumstances for them. For example, the student with the broken hand was granted the <i>accommodation</i> of having a scribe write his answers for the test. Always remember that <i>accommodation</i> is an <i>accommodating</i> word — there's room inside for two m's and two c's.</p></div>`;
