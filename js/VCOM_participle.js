var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">participle</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>participle</i> is a verb that acts like an adjective, like a running leap, scorned lover, or boiled egg.</p><p class="long">This is a technical word that will come up when you're studying grammar or linguistics. From a Greek root meaning “partaker,” a participle wants to partake of both the verb and adjective worlds. If you said, "I need a running start!" before a race, <i>running</i> is a participle. If you notice a trapped bear, <i>trapped</i> is the participle. This is a word that is a little confusing to understand, even though you use participles all the time.</p></div>`;
