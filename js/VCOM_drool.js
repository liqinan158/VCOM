When it actually drips from your mouth, you <i>drool</i>.</p><p class="long">The official term for drool is <i>saliva</i>. Babies drool, dogs drool â€” we all drool sometimes. Sometimes people drool (or <i>salivate</i>) because of problems with their salivary glands. You might drool when you skip breakfast and your friend offers you a warm, homemade cinnamon roll. The word comes from <i>drivel</i>, which today means "speak nonsense," but originally had the sense of "to slobber or run at the nose."</p></div>`;
