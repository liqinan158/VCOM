Bacteria are among the cells that can have <i>flagella</i>.</p><p class="long">In a bacterial cell, a flagellum twists in a circle like a screw, while in a eukaryote (a plant or animal cell), the flagellum moves in more of an <i>S</i> motion. These long, lash-like appendages propel cells forward, but they also help them sense temperature changes and the presence of certain chemicals. In Latin, <i>flagellum</i> means "whip," from a Proto-Indo-European root meaning "to strike."</p></div>`;
