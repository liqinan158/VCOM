If you say, "I hear you calling and I will come <i>anon</i>," the person calling you might still be impatient, but they'll be impressed.</p><p class="long">The word <i>anon</i> can be found as early as the 11th Century, with the Old English word <i>ƒÅne</i> meaning "in one," or "right away." The word is considered archaic, and sounds a little pretentious when used today. It fits much better in older literature such as works by Shakespeare. For example, in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, Juliet's nurse calls her just as the girl is bidding goodbye to Romeo, and she keeps putting the Nurse off by saying, "I come <i>anon</i>."</p></div>`;
