Originally, <i>knowledgeable</i> was spelled without the second <i>-e</i>, and meant “capable of being known, recognizable.” Now, though, we use the adjective to describe that which has or displays knowledge. If you're well-read and alert, you're knowledgeable about the ways of the world.</p></div></div>`;
