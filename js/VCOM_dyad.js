If you have a <i>dyad</i> of brothers, there are two of them.</p><p class="long">While you can use the noun <i>dyad</i> to mean "pair," "couple," or "duo," it's much more common to find the word used in a technical way. Sociologists, for example, use <i>dyad</i> to refer to social groups that consist of only two people, like a brother-sister dyad or a mother-child dyad. The word stems from the Greek <i>dyas</i>, "the number two," or "a group of two," from <i>duo</i>, "two."</p></div></div>`;
