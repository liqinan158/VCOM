If you've ever seen the famous portrait of George Washington crossing the Delaware River, you know just what a <i>tricorn</i> looks like.</p><p class="long">The first few United States presidents wore tricorns, which became less popular toward the end of the eighteenth century. Before that, European men favored them because their turned-up brims kept rain off their faces and shoulders. The Greek word for "three" is <i>treis</i>, the root of the <i>tri</i> part of <i>tricorn</i>. <i>Corn</i> is in this example related to <i>corner</i>, and both words come from the Latin <i>cornu</i>, or "horn."</p></div></div>`;
