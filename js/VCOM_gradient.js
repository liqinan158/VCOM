If you're a daredevil and you're looking for a road to fly down on your skateboard, you'll want to find one with a fairly steep <i>gradient</i>.</p><p class="long">In mathematics, the gradient tells you how steep a line in a graph is. In physics, when you say <i>gradient</i>, you're talking about how quickly something changes from one point to another. The word comes ultimately from the Latin <i>gradus</i> "step," and a gradient gives you a measure of the "steps" by which something changes.</p></div></div>`;
