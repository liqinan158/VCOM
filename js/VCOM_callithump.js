Hey, guess what? There is a word for that: <i>callithump</i>!</p><p class="long">Back in 19th-century America, before iPads and reality TV, people entertained themselves by throwing parades that were intentionally noisy, with instruments like tin kettles and rattles. The bands that played were called <i>callithumpian</i>, and their parades were called <i>callithumps</i>. Why not break out the pots and pans and revive this all-American tradition?</p></div></div>`;
