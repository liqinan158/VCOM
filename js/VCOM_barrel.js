If you're moving a <i>barrel</i>, it's best to tip it on its side because its shape bulges at the center, so that it's easy to roll.</p><p class="long">Barrels hold liquid in them â€” anything from wine to beer to oil. A barrel can also be the tube in a gun that a bullet travels through. You might hear the expression "stare down the <i>barrel</i> of a gun," which means you're looking at a gun pointed right at your face.  A barrel is also used as a unit of measure or to refer to a large unit of measure. When someone says they are having "<i>barrels</i> of fun," they're having a really great time.</p></div></div>`;
