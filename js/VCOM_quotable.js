A really funny movie is usually full of hilarious, <i>quotable</i> lines.</p><p class="long">When you <i>quote</i> something, you repeat it out loud or write it down, word for word. If the phrase or passage is good enough for this to be worthwhile, it's quotable. Shakespeare is famous for the number of quotable lines his plays contain, from "To be, or not to be: that is the question," to "A man can die but once." Quotable lines are good for speeches and yearbook quotes, as well as impressing your friends.</p></div>`;
