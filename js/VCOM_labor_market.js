Part of what makes up the labor market is simply how many companies are hiring. But it also involves the number of jobs, the number of people looking for work, and how much the jobs pay, among other factors. One aspect of the labor market is that if unemployment is high, companies can pay workers less â€” because their jobs are in demand.</p></div>`;
