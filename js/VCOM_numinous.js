When you enter a temple, church, or mosque, you might feel as though you've entered a <i>numinous</i> space.</p><p class="long"><i>Numinous</i> comes from the Latin <i>numin-</i> meaning "divine power."  This word also comes from <i>numen</i>, a word used to describe the spirit or divine power characteristic of a thing or place. However, you don't have to be in a strictly religious environment to experience something numinous; you might see the beauty of a painting or the melody of a song as numinous â€” if they communicate a spiritual vibe.</p></div>`;
