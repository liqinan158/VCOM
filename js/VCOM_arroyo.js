That's an <i>arroyo</i>, or a creek that dries out and fills with water depending on the time of year and weather.</p><p class="long">The Arroyo Seco in Southern California is an example of a well-known arroyo. Its name, which translates from Spanish to mean "dry stream" is an apt way to describe what an arroyo is â€” dry at times, and flowing at others. An arroyo can be natural or man-made. The Los Angeles River, for example, is an arroyo that runs along a concrete channel and helps distribute fresh water to the city.</p></div>`;
