The work and writing of Darwin himself are also called Darwinian, particularly evolution. Likewise, anything that resembles the process of natural selection or "survival of the fittest" itself, like a competition in which only the strongest athletes make it to the finish line, is commonly described as Darwinian.</p></div></div>`;
