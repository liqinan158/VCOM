If a town's mayor uses his influence to get jobs for his family members, that's <i>misfeasance</i>.</p><p class="long">One way to define <i>misfeasance</i> is "the wrongful exercise of lawful authority." In other words, the power or authority is legal and fair, but the way it's being used is harmful. If a judge, sheriff, city councilor, or other public official acts in a way they know will cause harm, it's considered misfeasance. This legal term comes from an Old French word, <i>mesfaire</i>, "to misdo," which combines the roots <i>mes-</i>, "wrongly," and <i>faire</i>, "to do."</p></div></div>`;
