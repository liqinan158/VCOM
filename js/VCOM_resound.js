When you sing in the shower, your voice <i>resounds</i>.</p><p class="long">If you remember that <i>re</i> means again, then resounding makes a lot of sense: it's what happens when a sound rings out or echoes. A loud, booming voice is more likely to resound than a little whisper. If you stand on a building, yell your name, and then here it again, it resounded. Resounding is also called echoing, ringing, and reverberating. If you've ever heard a ring announcer, the microphone helps his or her voice resound to the crowd.</p></div></div>`;
