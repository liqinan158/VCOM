If you need to get into the bathroom desperately, and the person in front of you hasn’t noticed your agitation, you’ll probably have to <i>verbalize</i> it, and quickly!</p><p class="long"><i>Verbalize</i> comes from the word <i>verbal</i>, which describes spoken words. If people are extremely <i>verbose</i>, that means they talk all the time. Very shy people don't verbalize their feelings very often. <i>Verbalize</i> can also mean articulate, or clarify. If I’m working for you on a construction site, and you yell “SLAB!” at me, I might have to ask you to verbalize what you mean by “SLAB!”</p></div></div>`;
