Some funeral traditions include a chance for mourners to see the deceased in the <i>casket</i> before burial.</p><p class="long">Most caskets are made of wood â€” some plain, and others more ornamental. Many caskets are buried in cemeteries, although others are cremated, or burned to ash, depending on religious and personal preferences. You can also use the word <i>casket</i> to mean "small box," particularly a box for jewelry or other precious items, and this is the word's earliest meaning, from the Old French <i>cassette</i>, a diminutive form of <i>case</i>.</p></div>`;
