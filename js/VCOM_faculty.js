If you lose your <i>faculties</i>, you are powerless. The <i>faculty</i> of a school is comprised of the people who work there. Lose them, and you have a different kind of problem.</p><p class="long"><i>Faculty</i> comes from the Old French word <i>faculté</i>, which means “skill, accomplishment, or learning.” You may have great <i>faculties</i> of memory, sight, mobility, charm, math, and musicality, but, as Beethoven was in the end, be robbed of your <i>faculty</i> of hearing.  Any aptitude or ability — inborn or learned — that you have is a <i>faculty</i>. Also, if you go to school, your teachers make up the <i>faculty</i> of that school.</p></div></div>`;
