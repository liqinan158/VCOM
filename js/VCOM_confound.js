You've also probably learned that, unfortunately, this trick doesnâ€™t work on your mom.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>confound</i> means both "to mistake" and "to confuse." If you decide to treat yourself to a delicious dessert, you might find yourself confounded by the overwhelming number of choices. If you end up ordering the chocolate cake but the waiter brings you chocolate mousse, the waiter has somehow confounded those two options. Another meaning you may come across in literature is "to damn," as in "<i>Confound</i> it! You are the most exasperating person on the planet."</p></div></div>`;
