It can be a physical <i>crutch</i> you use because you broke your leg, or a friend you depend on a bit too much when you’re having a tough time.</p><p class="long">A medical crutch is a device that helps you walk when you’re injured. A psychological crutch helps you when you need it, or think you do. Medical crutches come in pairs and have soft pads that fit under your arms and handles to help you rest your body weight on them. Other types of crutches fit securely around the lower part of your arm. The Old English root word is <i>crycce</i>, "staff," and the figurative meaning dates from about 1600.</p></div></div>`;
