If you've got big <i>weekend</i> plans, time may seem to move extra slowly on Friday.</p><p class="long">We often take weekends for granted, looking forward to a nice, two-day rest from our weekday responsibilities, but the concept of a weekend is a relatively recent one. After the Industrial Revolution, workers often found themselves laboring six or even seven days a week. You can thank 20th-century labor unions for the modern weekend we know today — it was their activism that eventually standardized the five-day workweek.</p></div></div>`;
