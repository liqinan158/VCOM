The word itself is Latin, combining <i>pater</i>, "father," and <i>familias</i>, "family." In other words, he was the father of the family — and in Rome, that meant that he had legal rights to everything the family owned and authority over each of its members. These days, the paterfamilias is more likely to simply preside over family reunions and hold grandchildren on his knee.</p></div></div>`;
