Before offering <i>charity</i> to someone, make sure he is, in fact, needy, and not just some fashion fiend dressed like a homeless person!</p><p class="long"><i>Charity</i> comes in many forms including monetary donation, volunteering, or providing clothes and food for those less fortunate. The Greek poet Homer said, “The charity that is a trifle to us can be precious to others.” Think of charity, then, as something that may cost you a little, but can benefit someone else greatly. <i>Charity</i> also refers to a nice way to treat people, an organization that helps people, or a plant with blue and white flowers.</p></div>`;
