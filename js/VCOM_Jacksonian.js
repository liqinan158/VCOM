A Jacksonian politician is one who supports a truly representative democracy that gives everyone a voice, not just well-educated elites. Before Andrew Jackson's election in 1829, some states still required citizens to own a certain amount of property in order to vote. Other Jacksonian policies included westward expansion and the forced removal of Native people, but the adjective <i>Jacksonian</i> is most commonly associated with democracy.</p></div></div>`;
