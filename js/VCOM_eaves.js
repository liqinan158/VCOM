If you hear chirping outside your window, it may be birds nesting in the <i>eaves</i> of your house.</p><p class="long">Eaves are an architectural feature that look good aesthetically, but they also serve the important purpose of directing rainwater away from the house. The word stems from the Old English <i>efes</i>, meaning "edge of a roof" and also "edge of a forest." You'll almost always see this word in its plural form. In fact, some dictionaries list <i>eaves</i> as both the singular and plural.</p></div></div>`;
