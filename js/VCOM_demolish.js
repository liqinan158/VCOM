The noun form of <i>demolish</i> is <i>demolition</i>, which often implies destruction by means of explosives. <i>Demolish</i> combines the prefix <i>de</i>-, which can mean “undo,” with the Latin verb <i>moliri</i>, meaning “to build" — which makes sense if you are thinking of 'undoing a building' with explosives!</p></div></div>`;
