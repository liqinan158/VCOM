A woman might <i>curtsey</i> when meeting a Queen.</p><p class="long">You show respect when you curtsey, but it's so formal that it isn't often necessary in most cultures. When a woman meets a member of royalty — like a prince or an empress — it's appropriate for her to curtsey. Figure skaters and some dancers also do a ceremonial curtsey at the end of a performance. A more common way to spell it is <i>curtsy</i> — both versions come from the root word <i>courtesy</i>, which you show when you curtsey.</p></div>`;
