Your job is <i>remunerative</i>, and if your research into new farming methods leads to a big government contract, then that also could be called <i>remunerative</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Remunerative</i> can also mean that something generates a lot of money, like the remunerative ice cream truck that appears at the park entrance on the hottest days of summer. In Latin, <i>munus</i> and <i>muner-</i> mean "gift." <i>Re-</i> means "again," emphasizing that the reward keeps coming, whether it is a weekly paycheck or something that continues to generate sales, like the ice cream truck.</p></div>`;
