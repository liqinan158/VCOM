An "abnormal condition of the mind" sounds like it could describe a lot of mental conditions, and in fact <i>psychosis</i> is a broad term that covers many different disorders. The symptom that those who suffer from psychosis have in common is that they don't experience reality in the same way that most people do; they may hallucinate, or see and hear things that aren't really there.</p></div></div>`;
