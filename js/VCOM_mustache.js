Some <i>mustaches</i> are as thin as a pencil line, while others are bushy and full. Salvador Dali was known for his long, curled <i>mustache</i>.</p><p class="long">If you're trying to grow a mustache, you might start by shaving all your facial hair except the strands that grow above your upper lip. When your mustache becomes luxuriant and ample, you can trim it with scissors and style it with mustache wax. The word <i>mustache</i> comes from the French <i>moustache</i>, which has a Greek root, <i>mystax</i>, "upper lip."</p></div>`;
