A marvelous thing needs to be really stunning, exceptional, or hard to believe. Marvelous things make people <i>marvel</i> at them â€” they're amazing and a little shocking, like a miracle. Winning the lottery would be marvelous. Finding out that ice cream is actually good for you would be marvelous.
