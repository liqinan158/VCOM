It’s a term specific to math, specifically geometry.</p><p class="long"><i>Hypotenuse</i> comes from the Greek word <i>hypoteinousa</i> which means "stretching under." The hypotenuse “stretches under” the right angle of a triangle, which has an angle of 90 degrees. A right angle is the kind of angle that appears four times in squares and rectangles. If your triangle has a right angle, the line opposite that angle is the hypotenuse.</p></div></div>`;
