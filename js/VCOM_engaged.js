An <i>engaged</i> reader really focuses on the words and maybe even jots down questions or comments in the pages' margins.</p><p class="long">If you're busy or involved with something, you're engaged in it. A formal reply to an invitation to lunch might be, "I'm sorry, I'm otherwise engaged" â€” meaning you already have plans. <i>Engaged</i> often describes people who have committed to getting married. You can see this meaning in the word's origin, the French word <i>engagier</i>, meaning "to pledge."</p></div>`;
