If you make an effort to <i>decelerate</i>, you might be happier â€” and healthier.</p><p class="long"><i>Decelerate</i> is the opposite of <i>accelerate</i>, which means "to go faster." <i>Decelerate</i> often describes slowing a vehicle, but it can relate to nearly anything, like a friendship that begins with hanging out nearly every day but decelerates when you move to a new town or get busy with school and sports. It doesn't mean the friendship is ending or over, just that the pace is now a little slower.</p></div></div>`;
