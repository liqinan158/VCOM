From there, a crane with a moveable arm came to be called a derrick because it resembled a gallows. Later, another kind of derrick was created: the kind of framework you can probably picture if you think of an oil well. That derrick allows the drilling tubes to move up and down, and all these types of derricks have a similar, up-and-down purpose.</p></div>`;
