Your sister's <i>waspish</i> complaints about dinner aren't likely to convince your dad to order pizza for her instead.</p><p class="long">This adjective comes from the word <i>wasp</i> and the notion that wasps are spiteful and ill-tempered, stinging petulantly when they feel cranky. If someone calls you waspish, that's what they mean â€” you're easily irritated. It's less common than it once was (<i>waspish</i> has been used since at least the mid-1500s), but it's still a great way to describe anyone who's quick to express their anger.</p></div></div>`;
