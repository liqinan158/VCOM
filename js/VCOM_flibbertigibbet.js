If your teacher calls you a <i>flibbertigibbet</i>, she clearly doesn't think you're a serious or scholarly person.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>flibbertigibbet</i> is a colorful — if slightly old fashioned — word for a ridiculous busybody, someone who talks and gossips a lot but doesn't have much of any substance to say. It's most often used to talk about a frivolous young woman. <i>Flibbertigibbet</i> is a Middle English invention, a word that sounds like meaningless chatter, and it's still used fairly often in Yorkshire, England.</p></div>`;
