The best teachers take care to call on the students in the back <i>timidly</i> raising their hands, not just the eager chatterboxes in the front row.</p><p class="long">While it's not a good idea to speed through the streets in your car, driving timidly can be a problem too, since your nervousness might cause you to slam on the brakes unnecessarily or drive too slowly. It's understandable to speak timidly when you're asking a famous movie star for an autograph or for an extremely shy person to behave timidly at a social event full of strangers. The Latin root of this word, <i>timere</i>, means "to fear."</p></div>`;
