If a scheduling mishap results in three extra people showing up for work, then you have <i>supernumerary</i> staff.</p><p class="long">You probably know that something that's <i>super</i> is extreme in some way. And in <i>supernumerary</i> you’ll see part of the word “numeral,” which means “number.” So it makes sense that the adjective <i>supernumerary</i> describes an excess of something — an extraordinary number of that thing. Similarly, the noun version of <i>supernumerary</i> describes someone who's extra and has nothing to do. She just isn’t needed, like the player who never gets off the bench.</p></div>`;
