But somehow "ready, set, <i>proceed</i>!" doesn't quite have the same ring to it.</p><p class="long">From the Latin <i>procedere</i>, meaning “go forward, advance,” <i>proceed</i> is a verb that simply means to keep going, particularly after there’s been an interruption. Synonyms include <i>progress</i> and <i>advance</i>. People who constantly interrupt make it really difficult for the conversation to proceed smoothly. And proceed with caution when crossing a busy street, but if the light turns red, you better move it fast!</p></div>`;
