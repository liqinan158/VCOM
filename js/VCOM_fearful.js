A kid who's <i>fearful</i> around dogs might cry or run away when sees even a small puppy.</p><p class="long">To be <i>fearful</i> is, literally, to be full of fear. You can also use this adjective to describe the thing that scares you: "I lay awake all night listening to the <i>fearful</i> creaks of the old house around me." Some people are always fearful — it's just part of who they are — while others are only fearful in certain instances. You might be fearful on airplanes but fearless when riding a horse.</p></div>`;
