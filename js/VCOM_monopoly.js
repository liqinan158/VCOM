If your sister claims a <i>monopoly</i> over the television during the Tom Cruise movie marathon, you would be wise not to touch that remote.</p><p class="long">In economics, a <i>monopoly</i> specifically means the domination of a market by one owner or seller. Think of the board game <i>Monopoly</i>. You’re trying to own all the properties so that you have a monopoly over the board and the other players have to pay you basically anywhere they land. You might recognize the prefix <i>mono</i>, meaning “one." Add it to the Greek word <i>polein</i> which means “sell,” and there you have it — one seller.</p></div></div>`;
