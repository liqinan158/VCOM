If you leave that heavy backpack at home, you'll be <i>unburdened</i> as you walk to your friend's house.</p><p class="long">People can be physically unburdened, like when it's your brother's turn to carry the picnic basket and you feel unburdened. There's also a figurative or emotional way to be unburdened: "It's pretty unusual to be unburdened by debt when you graduate from college." A <i>burden</i> is something heavy that you carry with you. Physical burdens weigh a lot, and emotional ones (like grief, regret, or hardship) are also heavy.</p></div>`;
