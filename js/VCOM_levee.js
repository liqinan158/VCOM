When the king rose from his bed and received visitors, that was a levee. When you raise up dirt or other materials to build a dam or levee, that's also a levee. Now, official levees don't involve kings––but you might hear of “a governor’s <i>levee</i> at the state capital.” And <i>levee</i> can be used as a verb, meaning to make an embankment, or shore up.</p></div></div>`;
