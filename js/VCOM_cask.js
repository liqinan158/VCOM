If you visit a winery, you will often see many rows of wooden wine-filled <i>casks</i> lining the caves and cellars of the winery. If you have a large party, you can open a <i>cask</i> of wine.</p><p class="long">Experts aren't exactly sure what the origin of the word <i>cask</i> is. They know that it is a noun that comes from the Middle French word <i>casque</i> or the Spanish word <i>casco</i>, and both mean "helmet," but how we got from helmet to wine-filled barrel-shaped container is unclear. Students may have heard of the word <i>cask</i> from Edgar Allan Poe's famous short story of revenge and murder set in a wine cellar, "The Cask of Amontillado."</p></div>`;
