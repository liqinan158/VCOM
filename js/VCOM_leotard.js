If you take a ballet class, you may wear a <i>leotard</i> and tights.</p><p class="long">Leotards are worn by performers and athletes of many types, including figure skaters, ballerinas, acrobats, superheroes, aerobics instructors, and more. While a leotard leaves the legs bare, a <i>unitard</i> covers the legs as well. The French acrobat Jules Léotard is credited with inventing the leotard, although he called it a <i>maillot</i>. The leotard came to be named for Léotard in 1886, long after his death.</p></div></div>`;
