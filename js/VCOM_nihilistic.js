If you go through your teenage years in a <i>nihilistic</i> frame of mind, nothing seems to matter to you.</p><p class="long">Someone who's nihilistic believes in the philosophy of nihilism, which embraces the idea that life as we know it is useless. If you're nihilistic, you don't believe in anything â€” not religion, a moral code, love. Being nihilistic is also closely related to the political philosophy of anarchism, a belief that all social structures need to be destroyed before a new, better society can be developed.</p></div></div>`;
