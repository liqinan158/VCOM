The Latin root of the word is <i>servus</i>, which literally means “slave,” but <i>serf</i> and <i>slave</i> are not synonyms.  There were many kinds of serfs, some of which were indeed slaves, but others were more like employees who had some limited freedom.  Either way, a serf’s life was a brutal and unpleasant life.</p></div></div>`;
