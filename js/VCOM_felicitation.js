Your best friend might express his <i>felicitation</i> on your birthday by giving you flowers.</p><p class="long">You'll almost always see the noun <i>felicitation</i> in its plural form, <i>felicitations</i>. In fact, when your neighbors announce their upcoming marriage, you can say, "<i>Felicitations</i>!" just as you might say, "Congratulations!" Either way, you're expressing your good wishes. <i>Felicitation</i> comes from the verb <i>felicitate</i>, which means "congratulate," and has a Latin root, <i>felicitas</i>, "happiness," from <i>felix</i>, "happy or fortunate."</p></div>`;
