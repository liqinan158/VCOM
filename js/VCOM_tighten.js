Your cousin's crazy driving may cause you to <i>tighten</i> your seatbelt and close your eyes.</p><p class="long">You can tighten things literally, the way you tighten the lid of a jar or tighten your hold on your best friend's hand as you enter a haunted house together. There's also a figurative way to tighten, like when a library tightens its rules about talking or a restrictive government tightens control over what newspapers are allowed to print. Before <i>tighten</i> appeared in the 18th century, the verb was <i>tight</i>.</p></div></div>`;
