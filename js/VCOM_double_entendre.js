We'd give you an example, but this is a family site.</p><p class="long"><i>Double entendre</i> is from a now obsolete French term, <i>double entente,</i> meaning literally "double understanding." The British —- masters of the art of the <i>double entendre</i> —- imported the phrase from their Gallic cousins. While some regard it as a low form of verbal humor, Shakespeare himself was a great lover of the form, and his plays are filled with some highly filthy examples.</p></div>`;
