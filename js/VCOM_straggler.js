On a field trip, chaperones worry about losing stragglers who keep wandering away from the group. <i>Straggler</i> and <i>straggle</i> probably share a root with the Norwegian <i>stragla</i>, "walk laboriously." In astronomy, a <i>blue straggler</i> is an unusually luminous star originally believed to have formed later than the other stars in its cluster.</p></div>`;
