And he would never put mustard on them, only ketchup.</p><p class="long">The original <i>zealots</i> were a group of first-century Jews who were absolutely determined to overthrow Roman rule in Palestine. Today, anyone who goes overboard in their <i>zeal</i>, or enthusiasm, for a particular cause, a religion, a sports team, or a charitable organization â€” can be called a <i>zealot</i>.
