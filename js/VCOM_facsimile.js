Many parents hope their children will be <i>facsimiles</i> of themselves; many children have other plans in mind.</p><p class="long"><i>Facsimile</i> comes from two Latin roots: <i>facere</i>, meaning "to make," and <i>simile</i>, meaning "like." Fax machines are so called because they copy and transmit facsimiles of documents, or <i>faxes</i> for short, over phone lines. Grammatically speaking, photocopiers also make facsimiles, but oddly enough those are referred to as <i>copies</i> â€” not <i>faxes</i>.</p></div>`;
