Like finding a <i>niche</i> in the scented soaps market with peanut butter body wash and winning over a loyal, if not nutty, following.</p><p class="long">In the 1600s, <i>niche</i> was first recorded as meaning a “shallow recess in a wall." The figurative sense of the word didn’t come about for another century. So today, you can use <i>niche</i> literally to refer to a cranny or crevice, or figuratively to talk about an activity or role in life that is particularly suited a person’s interests or talents. Synonyms range from <i>alcove</i> and <i>compartment</i> to <i>nook</i> and <i>opening</i>.</p></div>`;
