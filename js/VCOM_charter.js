They <i>charter</i> their own plane, of course. <i>Charter</i> means you rent or lease a particular service or object. Anyone can <i>charter</i> something, though lesser mortals tend to limit themselves to buses.</p><p class="long"><i>Charter</i> comes from the Latin <i>charta</i>, meaning "paper, card or map." As a noun, <i>charter</i> refers to a written document outlining — or mapping — the rights and obligations of a company or organization, or even, in older days, a town or entire colony. New York City was given a charter, for example, by the British monarch in the 17th century, guaranteeing it certain rights in exchange for goods and services. Today corporations still have charters governing their behavior.</p></div></div>`;
