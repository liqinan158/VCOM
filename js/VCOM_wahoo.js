It's also an expression of excitement: "<i>Wahoo</i>, we won the three-legged race!"</p><p class="long">In North America, it's common to use <i>wahoo</i> interchangeably with "yahoo" or "hooray," so you might jump around and yell, "Wahoo!" when your team wins the Super Bowl. The original meaning of this word is "burning bush," a North American shrub. The word is a distorted translation of the Dakota <i>wahu</i>, "wooden arrow." Experts aren't sure why the fish came to be called a wahoo around 1880.</p></div></div>`;
