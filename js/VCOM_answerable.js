But if a person is <i>answerable</i>, she is responsible for something, the way a team captain is <i>answerable</i> for the behavior of the team as a whole.</p><p class="long">Sometimes you'll hear a question described as being answerable or unanswerable. "What's the meaning of life?" is unanswerable, while "What did you have for breakfast?" is answerable. But if you are answerable for something (or someone), it means you're accountable. So you might say that a country's president is answerable for the actions of that country's military, or that your neighbor is answerable for the damage his dog did to the plastic flamingo lawn ornaments in your yard.</p></div>`;
