var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">pretty</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the word <i>pretty</i> to describe something with a delicate and pleasant appearance. Something that’s <i>pretty</i> is less powerful and intimidating than something that’s beautiful, the way a <i>pretty</i> floral raincoat is less intimidating than a beautiful film star.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>pretty</i> describes things that look nice, but it can also be used jokingly to say that something’s bad. If you say, “That’s a <i>pretty</i> mess you got me into!” that means it’s a bad mess. <i>Pretty</i> has an adverb form that means something is present to a moderate degree, another way to say <i>fairly</i>. You might be pretty sure you’ll be done studying by 9:00. That means you’re fairly certain but not positive.</p></div>`;
