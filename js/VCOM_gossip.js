It can be fun to <i>gossip</i> about others, but no one likes it when they're the subject of <i>gossip</i>.</p><p class="long">You can find people just about anywhere who love to chatter about the latest rumors and stories: they're gossips who love to gossip. You've probably seen all the celebrity gossip featured in the tabloids: stories about who's dating, marrying, divorcing, or having a baby. But don't trust everything you hear â€” gossip isn't always accurate, and often people spread untrue gossip just to mess with someone they don't like.</p></div>`;
