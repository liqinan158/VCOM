Your little brother jumping from the high dive is in free fall until he hits the pool water. A figurative way to use <i>free fall</i> is to mean "declining sharply," as when reporters talk about the plummeting stock market being in free fall, for example. The term first appeared in 1919, describing parachutists and rockets.</p></div>`;
