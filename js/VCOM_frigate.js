If you join the Navy, you may be assigned to work on a <i>frigate</i>. Ahoy!</p><p class="long">The word <i>frigate</i> has been used for a variety of seagoing vessels ever since the late 15th century. Over time, it's generally referred to larger and larger boats â€” the original frigates had oars and sails.
