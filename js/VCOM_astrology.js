The actual science of the celestial bodies is astronomy, which also includes the Greek word for "star" but with a suffix that means "arranging." Astrology has been around since ancient times, and while it requires some knowledge of astronomy, it’s about as scientific as fortune telling and palm reading.</p></div>`;
