If your math teacher <i>spontaneously</i> breaks into a tap dance, it will surprise the whole class.</p><p class="long">Spontaneously belting out a song on the subway is very different from practicing over many weeks for a choral concert solo. Things that happen spontaneously aren't planned: improvisation in music or theater, for example, happens spontaneously. <i>Spontaneously</i> comes from the adjective <i>spontaneous</i>, with its Late Latin root <i>spontaneus</i>, "willing," or "of one's free will."</p></div>`;
