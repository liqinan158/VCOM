A dog's <i>repeated</i> bark, unfortunately, is a sound that is continuous — and probably keeping you up at night.</p><p class="long">A repeated sound goes on and on: honking a horn just once isn't what this word is about. If you honk that horn over and over, it can be described as a repeated honk. In music, many sounds are repeated as well. The repeated beat of a reggae band is pleasant, while repeated non-musical sounds — like dog barks and annoying people who say the same thing over and over — get less and less fun the more they're repeated.</p></div></div>`;
