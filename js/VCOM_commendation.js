A police officer might receive a special commendation for being particularly brave. This kind of commendation is often awarded at a public ceremony. You can also use <i>commendation</i> more broadly to mean "praise," even if it's not official. It'd be nice to tell your teacher she deserves commendation for the good-natured way she has handled your rowdy class all year.</p></div>`;
