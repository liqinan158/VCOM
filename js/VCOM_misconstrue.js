If you <i>misconstrue</i> a friend’s silence, you might get mad at him for ignoring you — until you find out he has a sore throat and can’t talk.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>misconstrue</i> comes from <i>mis-</i> meaning "wrong" and <i>construe</i> meaning "construction." Combined they mean "to put a wrong construction on" — in other words, to interpret in the wrong way. Sometimes people can intentionally allow others to misconstrue something for personal gain. For example, a politician may let voters misconstrue her voting record if she believes doing so will help her get elected.</p></div>`;
