Plants and animals create their own exudations too. Funnily enough, while the noun <i>exudation</i> almost always refers to a physical discharge of fluid, the verb, <i>to exude</i> has a far more figurative meaning. Sure, you can <i>exude</i> bad smells or liquids, but you can also exude good will, bonhomie, love and just about any other emotion you can think of.</p></div></div>`;
