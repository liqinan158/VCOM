Pants made of flannel became popular throughout Britain by the early 20th century, particularly in sports like cricket â€” these trousers are often called <i>flannels</i>. Another kind of flannel is a washcloth or cloth for cleaning. The word <i>flannel</i> is probably related to the Welsh <i>gwlanen</i>, "woolen cloth."</p></div></div>`;
