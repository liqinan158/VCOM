The verb <i>advance</i> means "move forward purposefully."</p><p class="long">When you move forward, you advance. You can advance a chess piece on a board, advance toward someone across a room, or observe an army as it advances into a country. <i>Advance</i> also means "make progress," as when you advance your knowledge of Spanish by traveling to Ecuador, or "to loan money," which a bank does by making an advance of a thousand dollars. Since the 1700s, <i>to make advances</i> has also meant to make romantic overtures or to flirt.</p></div></div>`;
