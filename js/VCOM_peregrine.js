While <i>peregrines</i> are about the size of a crow, they are much fiercer predators.</p><p class="long">You can also call a peregrine a <i>peregrine falcon</i>. In falconry, the training of hawks and falcons for hunting, peregrines are popular. These birds are found everywhere on earth with just a few exceptions. The word <i>peregrine</i> has a Latin root, <i>peregrinus</i>, "coming from foreign parts" â€” these birds tend to be caught during migration rather than taken from the nest. <i>Peregrine</i> is also used to simply mean "migratory" or "foreign."</p></div></div>`;
