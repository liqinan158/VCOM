Most of the word <i>cause</i> is in there, plus <i>-ation</i>, which you might recognize as a noun suffix that describes an action or process. So <i>causation</i> is the action of causing something. It’s a formal word, and you'll often hear it come up in legal or scientific contexts. If you become a research biologist, you might do experiments to determine causation of a particular kind of cancer.</p></div></div>`;
