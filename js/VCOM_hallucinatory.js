If you think you see your cat and dog having a tea party at midnight, feel free to describe it as a <i>hallucinatory</i> sight.</p><p class="long">If you sense something hallucinatory, it's either not really there — it's an actual <i>hallucination</i>, an illusory perception — or it's as dreamlike or fantastic as a hallucination. You could describe strange dreams, surreal art, and bizarre movies as hallucinatory, for example. <i>Hallucinatory</i> comes from <i>hallucinate</i>, which originally meant "deceive," from the Latin <i>hallucinatus</i>, "wander in the mind."</p></div>`;
