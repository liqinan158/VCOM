If you hate <i>violent</i> movies, it means that you don't want to watch scenes of people being hurt or killed.</p><p class="long">Physically violent behavior ends in someone getting hurt or something being destroyed or damaged. You can also have violent emotions, like a violent burst of anger toward the slow driver in front of you, and you can use <i>violent</i> to describe something that's visually intense, like a violent orange-colored minivan. The word has gained in force since developing from the Latin word <i>violentia</i>, which means "vehemence or impetuosity."</p></div></div>`;
