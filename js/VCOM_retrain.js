Once your dog retires from guarding sheep, you can <i>retrain</i> her to be a visiting therapy dog in nursing homes.</p><p class="long">When someone loses a job in one industry, a state employment agency can often help to retrain them for new kinds of work. A mill worker might retrain to be a computer programmer, for example. The verb <i>retrain</i> has the "again" prefix <i>re-</i> added to <i>train</i>, "to discipline or teach," a definition that grew out of the meaning "manipulate and shape," the way a gardener <i>trains</i> a vine to grow up an arbor.</p></div></div>`;
