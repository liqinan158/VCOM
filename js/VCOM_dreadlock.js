Many reggae stars have <i>dreadlocks</i>; in fact, Bob Marley made <i>dreadlocks</i> a popular trend.</p><p class="long">Sometimes dreadlocks are called "locks" or "locs," and for some Hindus they are a religious practice, a symbol of lack of vanity, and they're called "jata," or "twisted hair." Words in the Christian Bible about allowing locks of hair to grow without cutting have great importance to Rastafarians, followers of the Jamaican religious movement, and inspired their embrace of dreadlocks. The name <i>dreadlocks</i> comes in part from the idea of "fear (or dread) of God."</p></div>`;
