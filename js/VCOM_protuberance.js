var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">protuberance</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>protuberance</i> is something that sticks out, like a swelling or a lump or a bunion on your foot. A <i>protuberance</i> doesn’t have to be hideous; it could be your nose on your face or a knot on a tree.</p><p class="long">The late Latin word <i>prōtūberāre</i> meant "to swell," coming from the prefix <i>pro</i>, which means "forward," and the root word <i>tūber</i>, meaning "swelling." And "root word" is appropriate here, since a <i>tuber</i> is a thick, fleshy part of a root, like a potato. And that should help you remember how to spell the word <i>protuberance</i>. Don't you love it when a word's meaning and its spelling work together?</p></div></div>`;
