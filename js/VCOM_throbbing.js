Music is often described as throbbing too, beating and pounding with deep bass notes from a club or a car â€” or maybe your ceiling is vibrating with the throbbing music your upstairs neighbors are playing. To <i>throb</i> is to pulsate, and experts guess the word itself stems from the sound and feeling of pulsating blood.</p></div></div>`;
