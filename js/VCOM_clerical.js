You might say "The Office" is a <i>clerical</i> comedy.</p><p class="long">In older times <i>clerical</i> had an additional common meaning of referring to anything to do with the clergy â€” those ordained for religious work, usually in the Christian faith. <i>Clerical</i> comes from the old Latin term <i>clericus,</i> meaning a "churchman," from which <i>cleric</i> later came, meaning a priest or religious leader. To have "a <i>clerical</i> air" means to be clearly identifiable either as an ink-stained office wretch or a member of the cloth.</p></div></div>`;
