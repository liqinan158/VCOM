Each key on a <i>typewriter</i> prints a single letter, number, or symbol in ink on a piece of paper.</p><p class="long">There are similarities between a computer keyboard and a typewriter â€” you use both by pressing one key at a time. But instead of watching a cursor move across a screen as you type (moving backwards easily, automatically deleting mistakes), a typewriter makes a physical mark on paper. Instead of printing your letter out (or emailing it), when you use a typewriter, you create the final product as you go, simply pulling it out of the typewriter when you finish.</p></div></div>`;
