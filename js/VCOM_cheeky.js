At the offensive end are the synonyms <i>rude,</i> <i>disrespectful,</i> and <i>insulting.</i> Less offensive are <i>sassy,</i> <i>arrogant,</i> and <i>shameless.</i> Rounding out the <i>cheeky</i> spectrum are <i>bold,</i> <i>assertive,</i> and <i>daring,</i> which are about getting noticed but without causing injury.</p></div></div>`;
