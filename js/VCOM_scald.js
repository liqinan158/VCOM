To <i>scald</i> something is to burn it with hot liquid. However, if a recipe tells you to “<i>scald</i> the milk,” it means to heat it to the moment just before it boils.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>scald</i> comes from the Late Latin word <i>excaldare</i>, meaning “bathe in hot water.” For example, if you scald a tomato in boiling water for one minute, it will be easy to peel. In medieval times, or any era when people protected their castles by pouring hot oil from the turrets, they scalded their enemies. Nice.</p></div>`;
