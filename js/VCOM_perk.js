The major <i>perk</i> of your job at an ice cream shop might be all the hot fudge sundaes you can eat.</p><p class="long">Some fairly common job perks include health insurance, free gym memberships, and company cars. You can also talk about the perks, or benefits, of a situation: "I have to ride to school with my annoying neighbor, but the <i>perk</i> is she always brings donuts." As a verb, <i>perk</i> means "to become more energetic or cheerful." So that donut perk? It might be just the thing to perk you up on a Monday morning.</p></div>`;
