You might stand on the <i>berm</i> by a lake with your fishing pole as you bait your hook.</p><p class="long">A <i>berm</i> is any stretch of grass or land that forms a kind of shelf above or along a river, train tracks, or highway. Some berms are a natural feature of the landscape, while others are man made. A berm can form a barrier between two spaces, and when the word is used in a military context it means a defensive wall of sorts. It comes from an Old Dutch root, <i>baerm</i>, "edge of a dike."</p></div></div>`;
