In the old days, the sound of a dinner <i>bell</i> meant that it was time to eat.</p><p class="long">A belly dancer might have tiny bells on her costume that ring as she moves, and the church in your neighborhood might have a huge bell that's rung every hour. Other kinds of bells include a door bell, a bicycle bell, or a school bell, all of which make a sound to signal something. The Old English root is <i>belle</i>, from a Proto-Indo-European source, <i>bhel-</i>, "to sound" or "to roar."</p></div>`;
