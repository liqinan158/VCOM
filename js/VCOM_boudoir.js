You could invite a friend for a sleepover and say, "You can sleep on the spare bed in my <i>boudoir</i>."</p><p class="long">These days, the word <i>boudoir</i> is mainly used for its humorous effect. You may also come across it in an old book or movie, almost always referring to a woman's private bedroom. A boudoir is comfortable and luxurious, and the word itself was popular among the upper class in the 18th century, from the French and meaning "pouting room," from <i>bouder</i>, "to pout" or "to sulk."</p></div>`;
