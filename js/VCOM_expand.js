It might refer to something concrete, as when you blow into a balloon and make it <i>expand</i>, or something more abstract, as when you study to <i>expand</i> your mind.</p><p class="long"><i>Expand</i> is a combination of the Latin words <i>ex-</i>, meaning "out," and <i>pandere</i>, "to spread." The idea of spreading out was always there, though the current idea of something actually becoming larger was first recorded in the mid-17th century. <i>Expand</i> is a versatile word that can refer to anything getting bigger, from a nation's growing influence in a neighboring country to a waistline that needs a larger belt.</p></div></div>`;
