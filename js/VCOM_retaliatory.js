When you shove your brother because he shoved you, that's <i>retaliatory</i>.</p><p class="long">Sometimes, wars are avoided because one country or group hesitates to attack another out of fear of a retaliatory strike. In fact, most wars consist of a long series of retaliatory actions â€” a bomb dropped to pay the enemy back for the bomb they dropped, and so on. <i>Retaliatory</i> comes from the verb <i>retaliate</i>, and the Latin root <i>retaliare</i>, "pay back in kind."</p></div></div>`;
