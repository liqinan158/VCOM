As you look out at the lake, the <i>stillness</i> of the water is a sign that you should take out the canoe rather than the sailboat.</p><p class="long">When there's stillness, you can hear very few sounds and see very little movement. The stillness of a quiet mountain cabin may be just the escape you need from the busy, noisy city â€” although you may find that stillness to be a little spooky at night. You can also use this word for a more specific example of motionlessness: "The butterfly's stillness allowed me to get a good look at its beautiful wings."</p></div></div>`;
