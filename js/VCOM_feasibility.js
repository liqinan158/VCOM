If you want to question your dad’s unreasonable plan for painting the entire house in a weekend, tell him you should discuss the feasibility of the task. The formal sound of <i>feasibility</i> allows you to question whether or not it can be done — without sounding like you’re shirking your responsibilities.</p></div>`;
