var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">ambivalent</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If you can't decide how you feel about something, declare yourself <i>ambivalent</i> about it.</p><p class="long"><i>Ambivalent</i> means "having mixed feelings about something." A Swiss psychologist named Eugen Bleuler coined the German word <i>Ambivalenz</i> in the early twentieth century, and it was soon imported into English. Bleuler combined the Latin prefix <i>ambi-</i>, meaning "both," with <i>valentia</i>, "strength." So etymologically speaking, if you're ambivalent you're being pulled by two equally strong things â€” but in practice, ambivalence often arises from caring very little either way. You might feel ambivalent about your lunch options if you have to choose between a murky stew and flavorless tofu.</p></div>`;
