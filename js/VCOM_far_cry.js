If you live in a tiny cottage and your next door neighbor has an enormous mansion, you could say that your house is a <i>far cry</i> from your neighbor's.</p><p class="long">Something is a far cry when you're disappointed by its difference from something else. You might say, "This hotel is a <i>far cry</i> from the way it looked on the web site" if you're let down by your tiny, windowless room.
