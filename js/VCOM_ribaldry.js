You might want to keep your friends' <i>ribaldry</i> in check if your sweet old grandmother suddenly shows up at your house.</p><p class="long">When people tell bawdy or vulgar jokes (like bathroom humor, or jokes about sex), that's ribaldry. Imagine a rowdy sailors' bar or even a scene in a Shakespeare comedy, and there's bound to be some ribaldry. This noun comes to us by way of the adjective <i>ribald</i>, "bawdy or lewd," from the Old French <i>ribaut</i>, "rogue or scoundrel."</p></div>`;
