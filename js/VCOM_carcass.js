But if that makes you squeamish, you can think of carcasses in a more figurative light, because a <i>carcass</i> could also mean "the inner structure of something." The carcass of an old burned out building, for example, refers to its remaining walls and beams. Or think of the carcass of the couch, its inner foundation, which is supporting your rear right now.</p></div>`;
