Skydiving might sound exciting in theory, but you might be a <i>coward</i> when it comes to actually jumping out of a plane. Which is probably wise.</p><p class="long"><i>Coward</i> comes from the Latin word <i>couda</i>, meaning “tail.” Have you ever seen a scared puppy with its tail between its legs? That’s what people who are cowards would be doing if they had tails. Being afraid of something dangerous might make someone a coward, but the word can also describe someone who avoids doing something difficult or unpleasant. If your boss makes his assistant deliver the unpleasant news about layoffs, you might call him a coward.</p></div>`;
