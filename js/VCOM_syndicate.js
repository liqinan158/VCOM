A <i>syndicate</i> might collectively raise money for a real estate project. A <i>syndicate</i> sometimes has a criminal side â€” it can also describe a similar alliance of gangsters.</p><p class="long"><i>Syndicate</i> entered English in the 17th century from the French word <i>syndicat</i>, meaning "representative of a corporation." The Lloyd's of London insurance group is an early example of a syndicate. <i>Syndicate</i> can also describe an agency that sells the rights to copyrighted material, such as feature articles, to newspapers or magazines. The word has a verb form as well. If you work for a syndicate, you might syndicate the classic "Peanuts" cartoon strip in hundreds of newspapers around the world.</p></div></div>`;
