Mineral deposits are found in the ground, so prospectors will commonly be looking down. They also use various tools—such as axes and metal detectors—to find the minerals they're after. Since gold is the most valuable mineral, it's long been the number one priority of prospectors. A prospector who finds gold could become rich.</p></div>`;
