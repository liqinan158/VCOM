If you describe someone's words or manner as <i>buttery</i>, you mean that they act insincerely complimentary or fawning. An old-fashioned meaning of <i>buttery</i> is "storeroom," like a pantry for keeping food or wine. Some British universities have a buttery, which is a snack shack for students.</p></div>`;
