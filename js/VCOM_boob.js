So if you're staring at a lady's <i>boobs</i>, you probably look like a <i>boob</i>.</p><p class="long">This is a very common slang word that's not really inappropriate. Nobody is going to get too mad about you using the word <i>boob</i>, though <i>breast</i> is definitely more anatomically correct. The other meaning of <i>boob</i> is similar to dope, dumbbell, dummy, pinhead, and numbskull. This meaning is also pretty harmless. Calling someone a <i>boob</i> is only a little insulting — not quite fighting words.</p></div>`;
