But you might be surprised that the root <i>define</i> comes from the Old French word <i>defenir</i>, meaning "to end, terminate, determine." In this case, <i>define</i> carries the meaning of "determine," but in a sense "end" and "terminate" apply as well. When you define something, that's the end of it â€” no more wondering. So if something is undefined, it's not yet determined.</p></div>`;
