The word comes from the Italian philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli, who wrote the political treatise <i>The Prince</i> in the 1500s, that encourages “the end justifies the means” behavior, especially among politicians.</p><p class="long"><i>Machiavellian</i> describes fans of Machiavelli, the Renaissance philosopher who wrote things like “It is much safer to be feared than loved” and “If an injury has to be done to a man it should be so severe that his vengeance need not be feared.” Modern psychiatrists even use it to describe a kind of personality disorder, a cold selfishness. When Machiavelli's first works were published, they were seen by some to be dangerous and amoral, and the word <i>Machiavellian</i> was coined.</p></div>`;
