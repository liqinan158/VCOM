Fire, snow, smoke, flood waters, or even violence are a few things that could <i>engulf</i> you.</p><p class="long">Suppose an amusement park had a ride called Into the Whirlpool. Sounds like one for thrill-seekers who aren't afraid of water. Riders should expect to get lost inside, fully absorbed by the experience. The word <i>engulf</i> comes from the Old French word <i>golfe</i>, meaning "whirlpool," and the prefix <i>en-</i>, meaning "in or into." Riders of Into the Whirlpool should expect to feel engulfed â€” surrounded by water and completely covered.</p></div>`;
