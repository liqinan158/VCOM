Imagine taking an equilateral triangle and chopping its tip off so that it's made up of two parallel lines on top and bottom and you've got a <i>trapezoid</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>trapezoid</i> comes from the Greek <i>trapeza</i> meaning "table" and <i>-oeides</i> meaning "shaped." Think of a trapezoid as table-shaped.  It has a pair of parallel sides that are also known as the bases of the figure. To find the area of a trapezoid, take the average of the bases and multiply it by the height. In anatomy, the trapezoid is the smallest of the eight small bones in the wrist.</p></div>`;
