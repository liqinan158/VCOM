You can use an ointment as a <i>salve</i> for an itchy rash, or maybe your kind words can act as a <i>salve</i> to comfort a heartsick friend.</p><p class="long">In some parts of the world, people pronounce <i>salve</i> the way it's spelled, but in the U.S. the correct pronunciation has a silent <i>L</i>. You can use this word for things that make people feel better â€” not just ointment: "A hot cup of tea is a <i>salve</i> for me." And you can also use it as a verb: "The nurse will <i>salve</i> your wounds now." <i>Salve</i> comes from a Proto-Indo-European root that means "fat" or "butter."</p></div></div>`;
