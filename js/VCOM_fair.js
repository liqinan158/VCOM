As an adjective, it gets a bit trickier.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>fair</i>, has several different meanings. If someone says, "That's not fair!” they mean whatever happened wasn't just or done in an unbiased way. If you have fair skin, you have a pale complexion. If the weather is fair, it's a gorgeous day out. If the rides at the fair were fair, then they were just so-so. And watch out if the umpire shouts "fair ball!" during the baseball game — that means it was hit within the foul lines.</p></div>`;
