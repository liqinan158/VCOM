var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">frenetic</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The adjective <i>frenetic</i> is another way to say frenzied, frantic, or totally worked up. Kind of how you'd run around the kitchen madly trying to cook a last-minute dinner for 30 of your closest friends.</p><p class="long">Sometimes tinged with fear and often quite maniacal, <i>frenetic</i> comes from the Latin <i>phreneticus</i>, meaning “delirious.” The Latin word, in turn, came from a similarly spelled Greek word which, when translated literally, means “inflammation of the brain.” So it's no surprise that a frenetic person looks absolutely crazed and super anxious.</p></div>`;
