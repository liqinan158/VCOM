So, when you <i>overestimate</i>, you assign too much value to the thing you are judging. If you overestimate how much time you have left to get to school, you could be late. Likewise, if you overestimate how prepared you are for a test, you might end up with a poor grade.  This verb is the opposite of <i>underestimate</i>, or “to assign too little value.”</p></div></div>`;
