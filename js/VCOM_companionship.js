A feeling of fellowship or togetherness is <i>companionship</i> â€” it's one of the reasons people get married or seek out like-minded friends. The word comes from <i>companion</i>, from the Old French <i>compagnon</i>, "fellow, mate, or friend," rooted in the Late Latin <i>companionem</i>, or "bread fellow," combining <i>com</i>, "with," and <i>panis</i>, "bread."</p></div>`;
