If you don't have <i>molars</i>, don't order the steak.</p><p class="long">Humans generally have twelve molars by the time they're adults, including the wisdom teeth which often grow in crooked and need to be removed. All mammals have molars, used for crushing and grinding food, but they come in a wide variety of sizes and shapes. <i>Molar</i> comes from the Latin <i>molaris dens</i>, "grinding tooth," from the root <i>mola</i>, "millstone."</p></div></div>`;
