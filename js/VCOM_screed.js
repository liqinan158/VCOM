Another totally separate meaning of the word is “a construction tool made of wood or plaster that acts as a guide for the thickness of new plaster.” <i>Screed</i> originally meant "strip of cloth," like the kind you might write a long list on in the old days. Still, if you’re speaking or writing a screed, it’s like you’re reading a long tedious list.</p></div>`;
