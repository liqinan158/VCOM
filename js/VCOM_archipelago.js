Wouldn't it be great to build your dream house in the Galapagos <i>archipelago</i>?</p><p class="long">It seems that <i>archipelago</i> came from the Italian Arciplago, the name for the Aegean Sea, which is full of many many islands. Somehow that became the word for any sea that is chock-full of islands. You can also use <i>archipelago</i> to indicate some other grouping that involves neither islands nor water but is similar to them. Your little sister might create an archipelago of Lego buildings on your living room carpet.</p></div>`;
