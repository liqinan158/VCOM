You might give your grandmother a big bouquet of colorful <i>tulips</i> on her birthday.</p><p class="long">The first tulips were cultivated in 10th-century Persia, and the word <i>tulip</i> stems from the Persian <i>dulband</i>, "turban," which tulips resemble. In the Netherlands during the 17th century, tulips became so wildly popular that the price of the bulbs grew to be approximately ten times the annual salary of a skilled artisan. This period is known as "tulip mania." During this same time, a tulip virus caused variegated, or striped, patterns to appear for the first time on tulip petals.</p></div></div>`;
