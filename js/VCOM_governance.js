It’s the nuts and bolts of how towns or states or countries operate, and it can also apply to companies. Corporate <i>governance</i> is how large companies are organized and run.</p><p class="long">Governments use the powers you give it to pass laws and enforce them, fix your roads, collect taxes — all those things you can’t do alone — and the act of doing that is called governance. Corporations have their own sort of government — they're run by boards of directors who tackle issues of governance, making sure the company is run responsibly. Scholars study theories of governance — ideas about how society should be organized to benefit everyone.</p></div></div>`;
