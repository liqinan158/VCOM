Tradition holds that it was the location on which Romulus founded the city, and it became a prestigious site for powerful Romans—including emperors—to build large, lavish homes. <i>Palatium</i> made its way into every Romance language and beyond: it became <i>palazzo</i> in Italian, <i>palacio</i> in Spanish, and <i>palast</i> in German. <i>Palace</i> entered English via the Old French <i>palais</i>. Power, affluence, extravagance: these are the qualities that should come to mind when you encounter the word <i>palatial</i>.</p></div>`;
