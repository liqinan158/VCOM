When there's nothing left, it's also gone: "Sorry you got here so late â€” all the pizza's <i>gone</i>!" You can also use the adjective <i>gone</i> to mean "died" or "passed away," as when your friend tearfully tells you that her beloved goldfish is gone. <i>Gone</i> is from the verb <i>go</i>, from the Old English <i>gan</i>, "to depart or go away."</p></div></div>`;
