The House of Representatives makes the formal charges, and the trial is held in the Senate. A two-thirds majority of the Senate is required for a conviction. Two United States presidents — Andrew Johnson and William Clinton — have been impeached. Neither was convicted. Other federal officials, like judges, can also be impeached.</p></div>`;
