Have you ever wondered about the meaning of life? This is the type of weighty question a <i>philosopher</i> tackles.</p><p class="long">In ancient Greek, the word <i>philosopho</i> meant a “lover of wisdom.” Thales of Miletus, who lived in the 7th century B.C., generally gets credit for being the first western philosopher, though he is much less well known than Socrates, Plato or Aristotle. René Descartes, famous for his declaration, “I think, therefore I am,” is considered the first modern philosopher, though he lived in the 17th century.</p></div></div>`;
