The big boss in a gangster film, a model on the runway, and the rap artist whose album has just gone platinum all know how to strut. The noun form of <i>strut</i> has a little less flash and refers to a vertical or horizontal support that holds something up, like the long steel bars holding up a building.</p></div></div>`;
