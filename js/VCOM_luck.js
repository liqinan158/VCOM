If something happens from pure good <i>luck</i>, it seemingly came out of nowhere, based only on fate and not on anything you did to make it happen.</p><p class="long">If you find a fifty dollar bill on the sidewalk, you might exclaim, "What <i>luck</i>!" Alternately, if you lose all night at the poker table, you'll probably blame it on bad luck. In both examples, you're referring to a mysterious, unpredictable circumstance that affects your life by chance. <i>Luck</i> has a Middle Dutch root, <i>luc</i>, which is a shortened form of <i>gheluc</i>, "happiness or good fortune."</p></div>`;
