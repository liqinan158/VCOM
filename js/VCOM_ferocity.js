A five year-old girl pretending to be a lion will display her <i>ferocity</i> by roaring and baring her teeth.</p><p class="long">Things known for their ferocity include wild animals, terrifying thunder storms, and fierce battlefield fights. A furious argument can have an element of ferocity, and so can a wild, loud piece of music. The Latin word <i>ferus</i>, which means "wild," is the root of not only <i>ferocity</i>, but <i>ferocious</i> and <i>fierce</i>. <i>Ferocity</i> came directly from the Latin <i>ferocitatem</i>, "fierceness, or wildness."</p></div>`;
