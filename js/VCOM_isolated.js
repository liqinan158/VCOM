The hermit who lives on a remote island is <i>isolated</i> from the rest of the world, with nothing but coconuts and fish to keep him company.</p><p class="long">The word <i>isolated</i> comes from the Latin word <i>insula</i>, which means <i>island</i>. You don't have to be on a remote island to feel isolated, though. Even people who live in big cities can feel a sense of isolation if they don't have many friends and spend a lot of time alone. In addition to remote or set apart, <i>isolated</i> can mean a single event, or incident. The high school students assured their principal that the cafeteria food fight was an isolated incident, promising that it would never, ever happen again.</p></div></div>`;
