You've just been given a <i>lagniappe</i>, or a small gift from a merchant to a customer.</p><p class="long">The word <i>lagniappe</i> tells a fascinating American story. Spanish speakers in the New World took a word from the indigenous Quechua language to make <i>la ñapa</i>, meaning "the gift." Then in New Orleans, where Spanish and French mixed freely, <i>la ñapa</i> got Frenchified into <i>lagniappe</i>. In Louisiana it's still used to refer to a bonus from a friendly merchant when you buy something. You could also call any nice little extra a <i>lagniappe</i>.</p></div></div>`;
