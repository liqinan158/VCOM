In the animal world, honeybees practice <i>monogyny</i>.</p><p class="long">Officially, monogyny among animals means that while the male honeybee (or spider, or ant, for example) will limit himself to a single mate, females are free to mate with many different males. This is the difference between monogyny and monogamy, in which both male and female sticks to one mate. <i>Monogyny</i> uses the Greek root <i>mono</i>, or "one," along with the Greek <i>gunÄ“</i>, "woman."</p></div></div>`;
