For example, you might say, "I will <i>hereafter</i> get my homework done in time."</p><p class="long">When you mean "from now on," you can say <i>hereafter</i>, like when you give a friend a new nickname: "You will <i>hereafter</i> be known as Brostache." Another kind of <i>hereafter</i> is what happens after death. When someone talks specifically about "the <i>hereafter</i>," he usually means heaven or life after death. This is the earliest meaning of the word, and it's often mentioned in religious contexts and at funerals.</p></div></div>`;
