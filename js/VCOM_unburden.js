Help <i>unburden</i> a friend by carrying her books or by listening to her troubles.</p><p class="long">When you unburden someone, you take away some burden â€” a task, hardship, or even something they're worried about. You can unburden new parents by offering to babysit or unburden your little brother by carrying his backpack for him. Another way to unburden is to relieve of an emotional weight: "You may feel better if you unburden yourself. Want to tell me what's on your mind?"</p></div></div>`;
