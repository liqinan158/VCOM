You shouldn't give yourself a pedicure while driving because it might result in a <i>collision</i>, wrecking your car and spoiling your toenail polish to boot.</p><p class="long"><i>Collision</i> comes from the Latin <i>col-</i>, "together," and <i>lædĕre</i>, "to hurt by striking." When a train hits a car, that's a collision. An asteroid hurtling toward earth is on a "collision course" with our planet. <i>Collision</i> also works for abstract conflicts that get violent or hurt your brain somehow, like the collision between two politicians during a debate, or the collision of colors in your outfit.</p></div>`;
