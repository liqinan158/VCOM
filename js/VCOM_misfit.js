var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">misfit</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A person who just can't seem to fit in, no matter how hard they try, is called a <i>misfit</i>. If all of your friends are great dancers, but you are awkward and uncoordinated with no sense of rhythm, you might feel like a <i>misfit</i>.</p><p class="long">Often, people who are misfits as kids eventually find other misfits to be friends with: suddenly, because they've found a group that accepts them and makes them feel comfortable; they're not misfits anymore. In the early nineteenth century, the word <i>misfit</i> meant "a garment that fits badly," but by the end of the 1800s it had come to primarily mean "outcast" or "oddball." The <i>fit</i> in both cases is wrong, thus the prefix <i>mis-</i>, or "wrong."</p></div>`;
