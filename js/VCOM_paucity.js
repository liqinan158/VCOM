var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">paucity</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The word <i>paucity</i> means not enough of something. If you've got a <i>paucity</i> of good cheer, for example, you'd better cheer up!</p><p class="long">One good way to remember the meaning of <i>paucity</i> is that it's a bit like <i>pauper</i>, as in <i>The Prince and the Pauper</i>. The prince had too much money, and the pauper had a paucity. There are a lot of words that mean "little" or "small," but <i>paucity</i> is used when you mean specifically "not enough" or "too little." People in Los Angeles don't understand how New Yorkers can live with such a paucity of space. For what New Yorkers pay for a tiny apartment, Angelenos get a house and a yard.</p></div>`;
