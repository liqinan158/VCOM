They can fly rapidly and change direction very quickly. A falcon is a type of raptor, birds of prey that include eagles and vultures. The peregrine falcon, is the fastest-moving of all animals. The Latin root of <i>falcon</i> is probably <i>falx</i>, "curved blade or sickle," which describes the shape of the bird's talons and beak.</p></div>`;
