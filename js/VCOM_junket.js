You've probably heard of a politician taking a <i>junket</i> to a fancy resort, all paid for using taxpayer money.</p><p class="long">A junket can be used as a gift to try to get something from the person going on the trip. If you're a travel reporter and resort owners pay for your junket to check out their new property in Hawaii, you might feel like you owe them a good review. A junket isn't always devious: the word can simply mean a journey taken for pleasure, like when you take your boat out and sail down the coast for a couple days.</p></div></div>`;
