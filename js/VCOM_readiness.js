An athlete's <i>readiness</i> for the Olympics has to do with how warmed up she is, whether she's recovered from injuries, as well as her psychological state.</p><p class="long">Your readiness for something usually has to do with how well prepared you are. Your parents might have decorated a room and bought a crib before you were born, in readiness for your arrival. And local police sometimes clear the streets and direct traffic away in readiness for a big parade. <i>Readiness</i> can also mean "willingness," like an eager kindergartner's readiness to learn how to read.</p></div>`;
