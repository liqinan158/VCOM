The best <i>cheerleaders</i> are extremely strong and flexible, with a great sense of rhythm.</p><p class="long">The main job of a cheerleader is to rally a sports team to victory, although many cheerleaders also perform complex acrobatic routines. The traditional uniform that a cheerleader wears includes a short skirt or shorts. In the late 19th century, cheerleaders were simply college students in the stands who called out school cheers in unison. By the 1890s, official cheerleading squads were formed, originally including only men â€” no women or girls were cheerleaders until 1923.</p></div></div>`;
