When your great uncle Marvin became infirm in his later years, trying to distinguish between you and your cousins tended to <i>addle</i> his brain.</p><p class="long"><i>Addle</i> is a Middle English word coming from the Old English <i>adela</i>, meaning “liquid filth.” It’s related to the German <i>adel</i>, meaning “mire or puddle.” In the thirteenth century, <i>addle</i> was used to refer to rotten eggs. Now it's used to describe a confused mind. When someone's mind becomes addled — whether it's from age or love or illness — it’s like the brain is rotten.</p></div>`;
