If your hometown's economy depends on tourists visiting every summer, you could say that tourism is the <i>mainstay</i> of your town.</p><p class="long">A mainstay holds everything together, whether it's your grandmother who acts as the anchor of your whole crazy family, a pillar that physically keeps a building from falling down, or the job that enables you to pay your rent every month. The noun <i>mainstay</i> is originally a nautical term meaning the rope that stabilizes two masts on a sailboat, and since the 1780s it's been used to mean "chief support."</p></div></div>`;
