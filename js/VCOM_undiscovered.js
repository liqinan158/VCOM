You might dream of becoming an explorer and mapping <i>undicovered</i> lands â€” or you might hope to be a scientist who finds previously <i>undiscovered</i> cures for disease.</p><p class="long">Use this adjective for things that have remained unknown or not discovered for a long period of time. Some of these will be undiscovered only to you, like the undiscovered secret garden in your city or a pile of undiscovered postcards your grandparents sent each other. <i>Undiscovered</i> comes from the prefix <i>un-</i>, or "not," and <i>discover</i>, "reveal, uncover, or disclose."</p></div></div>`;
