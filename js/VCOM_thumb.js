They're opposable, so we can move them forward and touch them to our fingers. Some monkeys share this trait, and they're the best able to use primitive tools. Your thumbs make it possible for you to brush your teeth, write with a pen, and snap. You can also <i>thumb</i> through the pages of a book — in other words, turn each page with your thumb.</p></div></div>`;
