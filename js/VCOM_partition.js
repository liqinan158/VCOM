When your younger brother decides to stop bathing, setting up a <i>partition</i> between his side of the room and yours seems like a good idea...until you realize your <i>partition</i> is not air-tight.</p><p class="long"><i>Partition</i> can be used as a noun or as a verb. As a noun, it usually refers to a physical barrier between spaces. As a verb, to <i>partition</i> is to separate into sections — like to partition an office space into different work spaces. One can also partition something that does not involve physical space — like when you <i>partition</i> school life from home life, you are splitting your life into two parts that don’t intersect.</p></div></div>`;
