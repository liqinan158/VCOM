You might <i>redo</i> your nail polish if the old layer is chipped, or <i>redo</i> your grandparents' living room if they're tired of the same old decor.</p><p class="long">Thank goodness for second chances! Whenever you start over on a project from the beginning, you redo it: "I painted over that self-portrait, because I want to <i>redo</i> it." Or, you might redo your English essay if you bombed the first draft. The word <i>redo</i> is most often used in terms of renovating a space: "Let's <i>redo</i> your kitchen! We can paint the cabinets and use that big piece of marble for the countertop."</p></div></div>`;
