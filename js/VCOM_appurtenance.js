If you buy a car, you may want to purchase a few <i>appurtenances</i> for it, like an ice scraper and fuzzy dice to hang from your rear view mirror.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>appurtenance</i> does not only refer to tangible objects, such as appurtenances of a certain lifestyle. It can also mean equipment or gear for a certain task. By the time you fill your locker with all the appurtenances of a high school student, you won't have room for a coat. Perhaps the appurtenances you should invest in are heavy sweatshirts.</p></div>`;
