Your grandpa might carry a <i>transistor</i> radio around on game day.</p><p class="long">You may have heard of a transistor radio, or a portable radio that was produced in the 1950s after the development of transistors. These tiny devices made it possible for much smaller electronics to be made, like radios that people could carry in their hands. Transistors are still used in electronic products today. The word comes from the words <i>transfer</i> and <i>resistor</i>, because an electrical current in a transistor is transferred across a resistor, a two-terminal component of electronics.</p></div></div>`;
