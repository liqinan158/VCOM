Freestanding houses, on the other hand, are completely detached, with space between each. You can also use the adjective <i>freestanding</i> more figuratively, to describe something that isn't reliant or connected: "It's a <i>freestanding</i> literary club — it's completely separate from and independent of the school."</p></div></div>`;
