Some people believe that ancient Greeks performed <i>pyromancy</i>. Don't dabble in <i>pyromancy</i> if you know what's good for you.</p><p class="long">Pyromancy is a very old fashioned kind of divination, or fortune telling. While pyromancy comes up most often in myths and fantasy novels, as well as computer games, it was actually on a list of "forbidden arts" during the Renaissance. The method of pyromancy varies, but it mainly involves seeing shapes within a flame and using them to predict future events. In Greek, <i>pyros</i> means "fire," and <i>manteia</i> means "divination."</p></div></div>`;
