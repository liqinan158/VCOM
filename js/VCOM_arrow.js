If you enjoy archery, you like to shoot <i>arrows</i> at a target.</p><p class="long">A bow consists of a piece of wood, metal, or plastic that has a flexible string connected to each end, and an <i>arrow</i> is the smaller, sharp-ended projectile that's held as the string is stretched back. When the string is released, the arrow flies. The Old English source of <i>arrow</i> is <i>earh</i>, which most likely comes from an Old Norse root.</p></div></div>`;
