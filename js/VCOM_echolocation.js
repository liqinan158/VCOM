Bats, for example, use <i>echolocation</i> to find food and avoid flying into trees in the dark.</p><p class="long">Echolocation involves making a sound and determining what objects are nearby based on its echos. Many animals use echolocation, including dolphins and whales, and humans do as well. Some blind people use taps or clicks and the resulting sound waves to navigate, and sonar uses echolocation to steer submarines through deep, dark water. The noun <i>echolocation</i> dates from the mid-twentieth century, a combination of <i>echo</i>, from the Greek <i>ekhe</i>, "sound," and <i>location</i>, with the Latin root <i>locus</i>, "a place."</p></div></div>`;
