Your t-shirt, jeans, underwear, and socks are probably all made, at least in part, from cotton, and so is your bath towel, pillow case, and the curtains on your windows. If you use <i>cotton</i> as a verb, it's an informal way to say "take a liking to." This meaning has a Welsh root, <i>cytuno</i>, "agree."</p></div>`;
