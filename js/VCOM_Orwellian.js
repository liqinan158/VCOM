The word <i>Orwellian</i> is most often used to talk about real-life situations that are reminiscent of this kind of state control and surveillance, called "Big Brother" in the book. Any hint that our government is watching or listening to us as we make phone calls or do Internet searches feels at least a little bit <i>Orwellian</i>.</p></div></div>`;
