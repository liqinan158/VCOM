Your humble requests for an ‘A’ may or may not work.</p><p class="long">This verb is derived from the Latin <i>supplicare,</i> “to kneel.” People often supplicate to God for help in the form of prayer, or supplicate to a judge for a lesser sentence. It is usually an earnest petition made to an authority figure and can be perfectly respectable or can be somewhat pitiful, like begging.</p></div></div>`;
