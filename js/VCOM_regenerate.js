Anything that revives in this magical way can be said to <i>regenerate</i>.</p><p class="long">While the verb <i>regenerate</i> can literally mean "produce anew," it can also describe what happens when something is fixed up, made "like new." An argument that's often made for bringing a new company, sports complex, casino, or other enterprise to a depressed area is that it will regenerate the town economically, bringing it back to life. In Latin, <i>regeneratio</i> means "being born again."</p></div></div>`;
