In the seventeenth century, for example, materials like wool that produced sparks of static electricity when rubbed were termed <i>electric</i> by scientists, and the figurative meaning of the word was also used. Figuratively, <i>electric</i> can describe something exciting or brightly colored, as in "<i>electric</i> atmosphere" or "<i>electric</i> green."</p></div>`;
