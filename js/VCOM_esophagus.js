The <i>esophagus</i> is sometimes called the gullet.</p><p class="long">Humans and other vertebrates have an esophagus. The word comes from the Greek word <i>oisophagos</i>, which means gullet, from the roots <i>oisein</i>, meaning to carry, and <i>phagein</i>, meaning to eat. In British English, the spelling is <i>oesophagus</i>. You should always chew your food thoroughly because you don't want it to get stuck in your esophagus on the way down, unless you're a heron and can swallow fish whole.</p></div>`;
