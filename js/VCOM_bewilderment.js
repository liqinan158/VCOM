People experience bewilderment when they are utterly baffled by the situation at hand. The word is a relatively new one, first recorded in the 1680s as a combination of <i>be</i>, "thoroughly," and <i>wilder</i>, "lead astray or lure into the wilds." You can think of bewilderment as being led into the wilderness and left to puzzle your way out.</p></div>`;
