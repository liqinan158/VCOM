When a married couple is considering getting divorced, they sometimes hire a <i>mediator</i> to help them come to an agreement, and possibly even avoid divorce.</p><p class="long">The word <i>mediator</i> goes back to the Latin word <i>medius</i>, which means middle. A <i>mediator</i> is supposed to remain in the neutral middle rather than taking one side over another, in order to help both sides resolve a dispute. Mediators negotiate between employers and employees, disputing couples, and in schools helping kids work out their conflicts peacefully rather than fighting on the playground or lunchroom.</p></div></div>`;
