Although you might think first of sun tans, which do indeed produce tawny colors in light-skinned people (as long as they don't go straight to lobster red), <i>tan</i> first meant the bark of an oak tree, used to cure leather. It's from the look of tanned leather that we get skin tans and the word <i>tawny</i>.</p></div></div>`;
