So what you’re saying when you call something <i>enormous</i> is that it’s beyond what is normal; you’re trying to convey a sense of exaggerated difference. You may also have heard the word <i>ginormous</i>, which people try to use as <i>enormous</i> with a dramatic flair. But, trust us: <i>ginormous</i> is not a good word; it’s just a blend of two words — <i>gigantic</i> and <i>enormous</i>.</p></div>`;
