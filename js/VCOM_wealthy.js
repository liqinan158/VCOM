Don't be misled into thinking "riches" means only money â€” to many people, to have a healthy family and to be surrounded by love is to be abundantly <i>wealthy</i>.</p><p class="long">The Old English word <i>wela</i>, via the Middle English <i>welth</i>, meaning "happiness and prosperity in abundance," is the source of our noun <i>wealth</i>. Although the Middle English <i>wele</i> meant "well-being," the word referred primarily to money and possessions. Many people still feel that way, but Henry David Thoreau offered a different view: "Wealth is the ability to fully experience life." That is, true wealth is having whatever means the most to you.</p></div></div>`;
