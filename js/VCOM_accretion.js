var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">accretion</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The process of increasing can be called <i>accretion</i>. Although you may say that stalactites "grow" from the ceilings of caves, they actually form from an <i>accretion</i> of limestone and other minerals.</p><p class="long">So what's the difference between an <i>addition</i> and an <i>accretion</i>? <i>Addition</i> implies adding to something that already exists, such as an addition to the cast (when a new actor joins an existing show). The noun <i>accretion</i>, on the other hand, implies an accumulation that causes increase, such as "an <i>accretion</i> of frost on the windows" or "an <i>accretion</i> of plaque on your teeth." The latter, of course, is why the dentist always begs you to floss and brush.</p></div>`;
