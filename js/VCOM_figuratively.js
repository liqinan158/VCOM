If a friend invites you to tonight's concert but you already have plans with your family, you might say — <i>figuratively</i> — that your hands are tied.</p><p class="long">Something that's said figuratively isn't intended to be taken as the literal truth, but as a symbol of something, or as emphasis. Figures of speech are good examples of things people say figuratively, like "the book begged to be read," or "I'm so hungry I could eat a horse" — not meant to be understood literally (you really don't want to eat that horse, do you?). The Latin word <i>figurare</i>, "to form or fashion," is the root of <i>figuratively</i>.</p></div></div>`;
