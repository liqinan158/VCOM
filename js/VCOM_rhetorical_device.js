Repetition, figurative language, and even rhetorical questions are all examples of <i>rhetorical devices</i>. You hear me?</p><p class="long">Rhetorical devices are common, such as saying language is a living beast: that's a metaphor â€” one of the most common rhetorical devices. Another is alliteration, like saying "bees behave badly in Boston." Rhetorical devices go beyond the meaning of words to create effects that are creative and imaginative, adding literary quality to writing.</p></div>`;
