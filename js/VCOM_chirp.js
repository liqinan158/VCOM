An extremely cheerful person also chirps: "The overly enthusiastic tour guide <i>chirps</i> happily as the bus moves through the city." <i>Chirp</i> may have developed as an imitation of the sound itself, or it may stem from the Middle English <i>chirken</i>, "twitter," which is rooted in the Old English <i>cearcian</i>, "to creak."</p></div></div>`;
