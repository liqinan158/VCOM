In other words, they are in the middle of a change.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>transitional</i> relates to things such as governments, office spaces, or aspects of one’s life that are in the process of changing. This is a temporary state, until a permanent solution is established, and the word is often used with a sense of hope. For example, when someone goes through a romantic breakup and is hoping to find someone new, she might also say she is in a transitional phase. A synonym for <i>transitional</i> is <i>interim</i>.</p></div>`;
