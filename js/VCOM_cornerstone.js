It’s an important stone, so it also means “the basic part of something,” as in, the <i>cornerstone</i> of the suffragette movement was getting women the right to vote.</p><p class="long">When a building goes up, putting in the cornerstone is a big deal and people celebrate. Many cornerstones are engraved with historical information about the building, such as the year the building was built. The cornerstone is sometimes made of a different material from the rest of the building too. From the sense of "foundation," <i>cornerstone</i> also means "essential element.” If you’re really into Italian food, you might say that pasta is the cornerstone of your diet.</p></div>`;
