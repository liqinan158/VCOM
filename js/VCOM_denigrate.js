Your reputation as a math whiz might be hurt if your jealous classmate manages to <i>denigrate</i> you, even though the accusations are unfounded.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>denigrate</i> comes from the Latin word <i>denigrare</i>, which means “to blacken.” To sully or defame someone’s reputation, or to spread negative or hurtful information about a company or a situation, is to denigrate it. Your neighbors may denigrate your proposal for mandatory recycling in an attempt to stop your plan. <i>Denigrate</i> can also mean that you're making something seem less important, like when your brother tries to denigrate your athletic achievements.</p></div>`;
