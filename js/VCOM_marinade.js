Before grilling chicken, you should let the meat sit in a <i>marinade</i>.</p><p class="long">Most marinades include spices, oil, and something acidic, like lemon juice or vinegar. Some recipes call for leaving food in a marinade briefly, while others instruct you to leave food in a marinade for days. This is a good way to make a tough cut of meat more tender. When you use a marinade, you <i>marinate</i> â€” both words come from the French <i>mariner</i>, "to pickle in sea brine," from the Latin <i>marinus</i>, "of the sea."</p></div></div>`;
