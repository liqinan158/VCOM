If you say "Please, pretty-please, I'll be your best friend," when asking for a stick of gum, you are <i>cajoling</i> the gum holder.</p><p class="long">The origin of this word is probably a blend of two French words meaning "to chatter like a jaybird" and "to lure into a cage." When you cajole that guy into lending you some money, picture him as the bird going into the cage. In fact, the word <i>cajole</i> may be associated with another French word meaning "to put in jail."</p></div>`;
