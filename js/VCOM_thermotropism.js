Once you know that, you can probably easily guess that <i>thermotropism</i> is a tendency to respond to (and usually grow toward) heat, since <i>thermo</i> means "heat," from the Greek <i>thermos</i>. It's mostly a habit of  plants, though it might also explain the popularity of saunas on very cold days.</p></div></div>`;
