You might like the <i>ambiance</i> of a certain restaurant because the lighting and decor makes you feel comfortable and happy.</p><p class="long"><i>Ambiance</i> is pronounced "AHM-bee-ahns." Most places have an ambiance made up of whatever sights, smells, sounds, and even sensations or textures fill the space. A fancy French restaurant gets its ambiance from the candlelight and chic black outfits worn by the wait staff while the diner off the highway might have a funky, retro ambiance because of its 1950s counter and jukebox full of golden oldies.</p></div>`;
