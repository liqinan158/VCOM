It means taking for granted your access to someone or power to do something. It's a very satisfying and effective word because it belittles and criticizes at the same time. In Shakespeare's <i>Henry VI</i>, Northumberland calls Warwick "presumptuous and proud" for trying to get rid of the king.  It's usually pronounced with all four syllables, pre-ZUMP-choo-us, although pre-ZUMP-chus is acceptable as well.</p></div>`;
