var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">disdain</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If you feel that something isn't worthy of your consideration, you may <i>disdain</i> it (or treat it with <i>disdain</i>).</p><p class="long">In Old French, <i>deignier</i> meant "to treat something as worthy." To <i>dis</i>dain something, then, is to treat it with contempt: "Management at [the company] displayed a certain <i>disdain</i> for safety and appeared to regard safety-conscious workers as wimps in the organization." As a verb, <i>disdain</i> carries an air of self-righteousness not associated with similar words like <i>despise, abhor, detest, loathe</i> and <i>scorn</i>. So if you disdain something, you might reject it with a haughty scoff, "Ha!"</p></div></div>`;
