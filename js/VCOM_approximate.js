A computer program can <i>approximate</i> the value of a house based on square footage, number of rooms, year built, and other relevant factors.</p><p class="long">As a verb, <i>approximate</i> means "to estimate." Unlike the word <i>guess</i>, <i>approximate</i> implies the use of a logical or mathematical method. You might guess how tall a friend is based on the first number that comes to mind, but you could approximate his height by using your own height as a comparison. As an adjective, <i>approximate</i> can mean "near" or "close together." If your friend calls to say he’s at a location approximate to your house, she’s in your neighborhood.</p></div>`;
