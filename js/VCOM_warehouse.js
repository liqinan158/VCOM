If you order a book online, it is almost certainly shipped from a <i>warehouse</i> to your house.</p><p class="long">When a business has to store a lot of items, they often use a warehouse, or a large building, to keep them safe and organized until they're sold or made into a finished product. You can use the word <i>warehouse</i> as a verb, too: "I need to <i>warehouse</i> all these roller skates, because they're not selling as fast as I'd hoped." <i>Warehouse</i> combines <i>ware</i>, or "manufactured goods," and <i>house</i>. In other words, it's a place to house your wares.</p></div>`;
