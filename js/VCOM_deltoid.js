The deltoid muscle got its name because of its triangular shape and its three distinct sections of muscle fibers. Weight lifters and body builders sometimes call these muscles "delts" for short. <i>Deltoid</i> comes from the Greek <i>deltoeides</i>, "triangular," or "shaped like the Greek letter delta."</p></div>`;
