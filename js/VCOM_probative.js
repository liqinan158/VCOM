A weapon with the accused's fingerprints on it would be considered <i>probative</i> evidence at a trial.</p><p class="long">In the law, the phrase "probative value" is used a lot, generally meaning "the ability of a piece evidence to prove something important in a trial." <i>Probative</i> comes from the Latin <i>probativus</i>, "belonging to proof," and is commonly understood among lawyers and judges to mean "tending to prove."
