If you want to insult the person who just stepped on your toes and belched, say, "Watch where you're going, you <i>lout</i>!"</p><p class="long"><i>Lout</i> originally meant a bumbling, awkward fellow, both annoying and pitiful. But if you call someone a lout today, you're also implying that he's not only stupid and clumsy, but that he's no good. <i>Lout</i> is almost never used for women, because the word has an implication of being bad to women â€” not abusive so much as selfish. If everyone thinks your boyfriend is a lowdown, disgusting lout, you might want to try dating someone else.</p></div></div>`;
