"She liked living in a <i>metropolis</i> because there were many opportunities in a city that were not available elsewhere, like 24-hour diners."</p><p class="long">The noun <i>metropolis</i> comes from the Greek roots <i>mētēr</i>, meaning "mother," and <i>pólis</i>, meaning "city." Historically, the word referred to the founding city-state of a region in Ancient Greece. Today the word refers to any urban area. The largest <i>metropolis</i> in Massachusetts is Boston, which is also the capital. Sometimes people use the word <i>metropolis</i> ironically or sarcastically: "She came from the booming <i>metropolis</i> of Tumbleweed, population 325."</p></div></div>`;
