Greta Garbo, Luciano Pavarotti, and Salvador Dali all became <i>renowned</i> in their respective fields. They won numerous awards, and who isn't familiar with their names? Even things or places can achieve <i>renown</i> if they offer something worth celebrating. An ice cream parlor can become renowned for its incredible mint chip ice cream, or a bank can be renowned for its excellent customer service.</p></div>`;
