You can <i>pour</i> good coffee into a cup and <i>pour</i> bad coffee down the drain.</p><p class="long">You can pour your heart out, pour a cup of orange juice into or out of a cup, or watch the rain pour down while a poem pours from your lips. A jet of water may pour from a spout. Listen to how the water pours in this poem from Lewis Carroll's book, <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>: “How doth the little crocodile / Improve his shining tail, / And pour the waters of the Nile, / On every golden scale!”</p></div></div>`;
