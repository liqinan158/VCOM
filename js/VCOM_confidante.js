She is a friend you can confide in, someone you trust with your private thoughts, and who you're sure can keep a secret. If your trusted friend is male, you call him your <i>confidant</i>. In fact, you could call a male or a female "secret keeper" your confidant (without the "e"). Both versions of the word come from the same root as <i>confident</i> â€” which you can trace back to the Latin word meaning "to trust or confide," <i>confidentem</i>.</p></div></div>`;
