If a reporter notes that "the White House released a statement," that's <i>metonymy</i>: "the White House" means the President or the President's administration.</p><p class="long"><i>Metonymy</i> comes from the Greek word <i>metonymia</i>, meaning “a change of name.” You've probably heard examples of metonymy, even if you didn't know the technical name for this figure of speech. Describing a monarch as "the Crown" or businesspeople as "suits" is metonymy. The expression "the pen is mightier than the sword" uses metonymy twice: "the pen" refers to writing, while "the sword" refers to war. Don't confuse metonymy with <i>synecdoche</i>, a related figure of speech in which a part is used to refer to the whole.</p></div></div>`;
