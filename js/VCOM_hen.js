It's important to make sure your new backyard chickens are <i>hens</i> and not roosters â€” otherwise, those eggs you're looking forward to just aren't going to happen.</p><p class="long">You can use the word <i>hen</i> for the female of many birds, including turkeys, pheasants, and quail, as well as for a female lobster. In parts of Britain, a <i>hen</i> can also be a (slightly offensive) slang term for a woman, and if something's described as being "rare as <i>hen's</i> teeth," it's extremely precious or scarce.</p></div></div>`;
