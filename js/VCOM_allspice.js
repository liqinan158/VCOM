The flavor of <i>allspice</i> is particularly important in jerk chicken and other Caribbean dishes.</p><p class="long">Allspice was first imported from Jamaica to England in the 16th century. Its distinct flavor, which resembles a combination of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves, inspired the English name <i>allspice</i>, and some historians credit a physician who accompanied Christopher Columbus with coining the name. The tree which produces the fruit is called an <i>allspice</i> as well, also known as a Jamaican pepper tree.</p></div></div>`;
