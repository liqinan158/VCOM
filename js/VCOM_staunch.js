You might want to go to that concert Friday night, but your parents' staunch opposition prevents you.</p><p class="long"><i>Staunch</i> is sometimes used as a verb to mean "to stop the flow of a liquid," but most usage books will tell you it's better to use the word <i>stanch</i> for the verb. Think of a soldier stopping and standing still, and you will understand the connection between the two meanings. The adjectival form should make you think of "stand," as in “stand firm,” or "take a stand." It comes from the French <i>estanche</i> meaning “watertight” and the Latin <i>stanticare,</i> which is probably from <i>stans</i> for “stand.”</p></div>`;
