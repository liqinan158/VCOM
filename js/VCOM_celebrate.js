You might <i>celebrate</i> a birthday, a religious holiday, or even the anniversary of a famous battle.</p><p class="long">Use <i>celebrate</i> for festive, happy occasions. If the special day, event, or holiday is more solemn or introspective, a verb like <i>observe</i> is often used. After we observe Memorial Day, we look forward to celebrating the Fourth of July. The verb can also mean to honor or praise â€” "The book <i>celebrated</i> the life of the actress who had given so much to worthy causes."</p></div></div>`;
