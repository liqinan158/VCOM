You wouldn't want to use boards full of <i>knotholes</i> to build a boat, but they're fine for a backyard tree house.</p><p class="long">Many types of wood form round, raised imperfections called <i>knots</i>, which mark the spot where a branch used to be before it died and fell off the tree. Many paneled rooms are lined with "knotty pine," a light-colored wood marked with many of these knots. When a knot falls out of a cut length of wood, it leaves a knothole behind.</p></div></div>`;
