var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">becoming</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Something that's <i>becoming</i> is charming, or looks good. It's a compliment — or a sales tactic — if a salesperson gushes, "That dress is so <i>becoming</i> on you!"</p><p class="long">Clothing that's becoming is well-suited to the person wearing it, flattering him and making him look great. You can also use the adjective to mean "appropriate," as when a stern kindergarten teacher scolds, "That behavior is not <i>becoming</i>, boys." In the 13th century, something <i>becoming</i> was "fitting," and by the 1560s it also meant "looking good." The opposite of <i>becoming</i> is <i>unbecoming</i>.</p></div>`;
