When you are sick and have a fever, your <i>skin</i> feels warm.</p><p class="long">Skin is something we have in common with other vertebrates. The peels of some fruits and vegetables are sometimes called <i>skin</i> too. As a verb, <i>skin</i> means to remove a peel or skin, or to scrape your skin: "If you skateboard in shorts, you're going to <i>skin</i> your knee." If you do something "by the <i>skin</i> of your teeth," you just barely manage it. <i>Skin</i> comes from the Old Norse word <i>skinn</i>, "animal hide."</p></div>`;
