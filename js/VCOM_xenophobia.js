Given that the fear in question is of strangers, it makes sense that <i>xeno-</i> comes from the Greek word for — you guessed it — "stranger, foreigner." In the case of <i>xenophobia</i>, the fear is irrational. Someone who is xenophobic might distrust a neighbor he's never met, or a sheikh who lives halfway around the world. Xenophobia is like racism, but instead of fearing or distrusting people because of the color of their skin, you fear or distrust them because of their nationality, or because they are — or seem — foreign to you.</p></div></div>`;
