Some <i>braziers</i> are used for cooking food, while others are entirely meant to provide heat.</p><p class="long">Braziers were once commonly seen outdoors, lit to warm people on picket lines or in other situations where they had to be out in the cold for a long time. Most braziers are made from metal and are small enough to be portable. Some people refer to a small cooking stove, like a hibachi or a grill, as a brazier. The French root of the word is <i>brasier</i>, "pan of hot coals," from <i>brese</i>, or "embers."</p></div></div>`;
