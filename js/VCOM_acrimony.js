It sounds bitter, like acid.</p><p class="long"><i>Acrimony</i> comes from the Latin word <i>acrimonia</i>, meaning basically "sharpness." Although it sounds like <i>matrimony</i>, the only thing the words have in common is the suffix from <i>monium</i> which means "state, condition." So it's the state of being acrid, or bitter. It's not just for married folks, though â€” this slightly dusty noun can refer to any sharp, bitter feeling. After a drawn-out court case, there might be lingering acrimony stirred up during the trial. Not surprisingly, it's also the name of a British heavy metal band from the '90s.</p></div></div>`;
