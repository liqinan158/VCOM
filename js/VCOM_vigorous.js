It comes from the French word <i>vigour,</i> meaning "liveliness, activity." An active, physically energetic person is vigorous, and mental activities can be vigorous too, when they require a lot of mental effort. A vigorous argument doesnâ€™t have to include physical wrestling; it just might involve verbal sparring.</p></div></div>`;
