When something is "on <i>standby</i>," it's ready to jump in or be used immediately. And when you fly on standby, you are ready to take an extra seat on a flight if one becomes available. <i>Standby</i> comes from nautical slang for "a vessel kept for emergencies," originally "that which stands by one."</p></div></div>`;
