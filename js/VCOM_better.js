A great movie is better than a good or awful movie. With practice, you will get better at a sport or a subject like math. Doctors help patients feel better, and mechanics make a car run better. If 51% or more of the people voted for you, then you had the support of better than half the people. When things are getting better, they're improving.</p></div></div>`;
