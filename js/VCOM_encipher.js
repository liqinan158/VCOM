You can <i>encipher</i> a note to your friend by replacing the letters with specific numbers.</p><p class="long">If your friend enciphers an email before sending it, you'll need the know what code they used before you can decipher it and read it. A simple way to encipher language is to replace <i>A</i> with <i>1</i>, <i>B</i> with <i>2</i>, and so on. Originally, <i>cipher</i> meant "do arithmetic," from the Arabic root <i>sifr</i>, "zero," and because coding with numbers was so common, <i>cipher</i> came to mean "write in code."</p></div>`;
