However, as basic as ten may seem, it's not the only possible basis for a number system: a system based on sixteen is a hexadecimal system. There aren't a lot of uses for this word elsewhere, but it is used by computer programmers, where itâ€™s common enough to be abbreviated as <i>hex</i>.</p></div></div>`;
