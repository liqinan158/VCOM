After a day of hiking in the cold, you might enjoy a mug of hot chocolate while lounging in a comfy <i>terry</i> robe.</p><p class="long">Look closely at terry (also called  <i>terry cloth</i>), and you'll see that it's made from loops of thread. These loops give terry its softness, and they also make it especially good at absorbing water. Baby clothing, cloth diapers, and sweatbands are all commonly made of terry. Terry towels were first made and sold industrially in 1850.</p></div>`;
