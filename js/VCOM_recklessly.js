If you <i>recklessly</i> throw a football near your neighbor's house, you may end up paying to repair a broken window.</p><p class="long">The adverb <i>recklessly</i> is nearly the same as <i>carelessly</i>, with one difference: doing something recklessly implies that your action is potentially dangerous in some way. Driving recklessly is always a terrible idea, as is recklessly spending every last dollar in your bank account. This risky word can be traced back to the Old English <i>receleas</i>, "careless, thoughtless, or heedless."</p></div></div>`;
