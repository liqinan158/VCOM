If someone cautions you, "Don't be <i>smart</i> with me!" â€” they are demanding that you stop acting so bold and rude. As a verb, if something smarts, then it hurts. If your knee smarts, then you probably whacked it. However, if someone says that you are a smart dresser or a smart thinker, you can take those comments as compliments.</p></div>`;
