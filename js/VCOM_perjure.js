If a witness to a crime deliberately gives false information in front of a judge, they <i>perjure</i> themselves.</p><p class="long">It's possible to perjure yourself — or commit the crime of <i>perjury</i> — in a written statement or during any other legal transaction that requires you to swear you'll tell the truth. You only perjure yourself, however, if you tell a deliberate lie that affects the outcome of a trial or other legal decision. The Old French source of the word <i>perjure</i> is <i>parjurer</i>, "to break one's word," from the Latin root <i>periurare</i>, "to swear falsely."</p></div>`;
