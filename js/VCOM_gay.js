A <i>gay</i> person is homosexual, but if we describe something like a scene or a party as <i>gay</i>, that means it's bright, merry, and happy.</p><p class="long"><i>Gay</i> originally meant excited, festive and merry. Skipping down the street is something you'd do in a <i>gay</i> mood. A fun dinner party could be described as full of laughter and <i>gaiety</i>.  <i>Gay</i> really only came to mean homosexual in the last century. The fight for <i>gay rights</i> doesnâ€™t mean a fight for the right to be festive, it means a fight against discrimination.</p></div>`;
