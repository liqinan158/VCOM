You might feel a little shy about your own attempts at <i>poesy</i>, especially if every single one of your verses starts with the line "Roses are red, violets are blue..."</p><p class="long">If you need an old-fashioned way to talk about poetry or the art of writing poems, use <i>poesy</i>. You can tell your English teacher you prefer poesy to prose, especially if you're partial to short, rhyming poems. Back in the 14th century, this word was a common way to refer to the craft of writing verse. It comes from the Greek root <i>poesis</i>, "poetry" or "a making."</p></div></div>`;
