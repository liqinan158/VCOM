var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">pelt</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>pelt</i> is an animal's skin, fur and all. If you are wearing a fur coat, you are really wearing a <i>pelt</i> (hate to break it to you).</p><p class="long">Another meaning of <i>pelt</i> is to throw something at someone â€” over and over again. Attacking armies might pelt the enemy with bombs, and there's always some kid in the back of an elementary school classroom who tries to pelt his classmates with spitballs. Either way, there is an attack or bombardment involved. If you dare to wear an animal pelt in front of an animal rights activist, you might just get pelted with a tomato.</p></div>`;
