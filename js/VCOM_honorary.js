On the other hand, an honorary Ph.D. is given to a respected or beloved person who didn’t go through the program. An honorary position in a government may sound fancy, but it carries no power or responsibilities (and is usually unpaid). In many ways, it’s not a real position. Honorary things are just titles.</p></div>`;
