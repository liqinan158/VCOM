A peace treaty is an attempt to nullify aggression and division within a region.</p><p class="long">If you take a null, or a zero, and make it into an action you can take, and you’ve got <i>nullify</i> —  the act of making something void or zero-like. If you have an argument with your friend, it might nullify the fun you had together that day. This word is particularly used in legal language — a divorce nullifies a marriage — or in business disputes where you are trying to nullify someone else’s actions or plans.</p></div>`;
