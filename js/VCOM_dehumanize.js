Laboring under terrible conditions can <i>dehumanize</i> workers, making them feel more like robots than people.</p><p class="long">War can dehumanize people in a few different ways. Violent or seemingly endless fighting might dehumanize soldiers, causing them to stop feeling normal human emotions. War propaganda might dehumanize the enemy, making people more willing to fight against and kill them. At the heart of <i>dehumanize</i> is <i>human</i>, and its Latin root <i>humanus</i>, which means both "human" and "humane, kind, or civilized."</p></div>`;
