The warden in a women's prison is also called a <i>matron</i>, which may lead you to conclude that the term is often not a glowing compliment.</p><p class="long">In a wedding, you can have a maid of honor (the bride’s unmarried attendant) or a matron of honor (one who’s married). <i>Matron</i> includes the Latin root <i>mater,</i> "mother" — as in “maternal,” “maternity,” and “matrimony.” You may imagine matrons as gray-haired and stern, like Nurse Ratched in <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,</i> and to avoid negative stereotypes, the title <i>matron,</i> for the woman who runs a nursing home or boarding school, is often replaced with the gender-neutral “director.”</p></div>`;
