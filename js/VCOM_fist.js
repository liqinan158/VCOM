First you need  to curl your fingers into your palm to make a <i>fist</i>, or a clenched hand.</p><p class="long">You might make a fist and bump it against your friend's as a greeting, or use it to clutch something tightly: "She held the balloon in one fist, and an ice cream cone in the other." Fists are also used to punch hard, and a <i>fist fight</i> is a serious physical altercation. When we trace this word back to its origin, we find a closely related root meaning "five," for the five fingers of a hand.</p></div></div>`;
