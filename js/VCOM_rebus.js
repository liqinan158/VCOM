A picture of an eye, a heart, and a ewe might be used to say "I love you." Isn't that sweet?</p><p class="long">A rebus uses pictures and symbols to convey a message in what may be considered a fun code. The letters <i>ICU</i> might be used to stand for the sentence “I see you.” The word <i>rebus</i> could be depicted with the letters <i>RE</i> followed by a picture of a school bus. Some children's books use rebuses as a way of introducing kids to the reading process, but rebuses can also be quite challenging, even for the adult mind.</p></div></div>`;
