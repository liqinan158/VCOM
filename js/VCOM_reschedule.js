If you schedule a trip to the water park, but the weather looks stormy, you definitely want to <i>reschedule</i> for a day when there won't be lightning.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>reschedule</i> can also refer to rearranging a payment schedule for a loan or other debt, especially to defer a payment. Sometimes your bank will offer you the chance to <i>reschedule</i> a payment — especially around the holidays — but be careful when deciding to make a payment later because the bank may charge you a fee and you may still be charged interest. You will need to reschedule the time of your meeting because some of the members of the committee can't make it on the day you've chosen.</p></div>`;
