If you are comfortable around people, you can be yourself. It can also mean "secure" â€” a family that, though not rich, lives a comfortable lifestyle, meaning they have considerable savings, or you feeling comfortable speaking Spanish in Chile, meaning you trust your ability to communicate.</p></div>`;
