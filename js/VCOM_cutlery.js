They're collectively referred to as <i>cutlery</i>, the implements you use when you eat food. Dig in!</p><p class="long">You can use the noun <i>cutlery</i> for every single kitchen tool you use to serve or prepare food, but it's most commonly used for the ones you put beside your plate when you set the table. Other terms for cutlery include <i>flatware</i> and <i>silverware</i>. As you might guess from the <i>cut</i> within the word, <i>cutlery</i> was originally used only for cutting utensils â€” knives, in other words.</p></div></div>`;
