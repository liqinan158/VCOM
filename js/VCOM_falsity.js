If you fake cry to try and get out of trouble, the <i>falsity</i> of your emotions will get you busted.</p><p class="long">Falsity is a word for statements that are false in the sense of being incorrect, untrue, or even dishonest. If you tell a lie, you've told a falsity, which can also be called an untruth or falsehood. Also, falsity can mean the general state of falseness. Con men and other liars often operate in falsity. A spy must use falsity to fool people. The opposite of falsity — or falseness — is truth.</p></div>`;
