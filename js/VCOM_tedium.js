You may loathe the <i>tedium</i> of eating dinner with the family — after all, what is more boring than talking to mom and dad, especially if you could be texting friends?</p><p class="long">The noun <i>tedium</i> comes from the Latin root word <i>taedere</i>, meaning to weary of, and that's still what <i>tedium</i> means today: bored and weary of it all. The noun can also mean a tedious period of time — school concerts and assemblies are always two hours of tedium. <i>Tedious</i> is a related adjective form of the word. In order to relieve the tedium of homework, you should pick less tedious tasks, try fencing or painting to add some excitement to the day.</p></div></div>`;
