It's important for communication, since the forehead helps people express basic emotions â€” muscles in your forehead control the movement of your eyebrows, which help you express concern and anger, among other feelings. <i>Forehead</i> has the Old English roots <i>fore</i>, "the front part," and <i>heafod</i>, "top of the body," or "head."</p></div>`;
