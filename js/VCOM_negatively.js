It’s the opposite of positively. If you view something negatively, you’re seeing it in a bad light. If you tell someone she’s your best friend and she reacts negatively, it’s time to meet some new people! Also, magnets have negative and positive charges, so you can speak of a negatively charged magnet.</p></div>`;
