If someone tells you that you have "<i>raven</i> tresses," they are commenting on your hair color, not your eating habits.</p><p class="long">If you see a large group of ravens, you can call them an unkindness of ravens, or a conspiracy of ravens. <i>Raven</i> is also an adjective for anything that's the glossy black color of a raven's feathers: "His <i>raven</i> hair was held out of his eyes with a sweatband." Probably the most famous literary raven is the one in Edgar Allen Poe's spooky poem "The <i>Raven</i>," especially in the repeated line, "Quoth the <i>Raven</i>, 'Nevermore!'"</p></div>`;
