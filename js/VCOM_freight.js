It can also mean the charge for sending goods. You pay <i>freight</i> for the <i>freight</i> of your <i>freight</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Freight</i> can also be used as a verb. If you freight a train with goods, you load it up with items to be shipped, and if you freight your furniture to your new home in another state, you send it there. Use <i>freight</i> like this only if you are sending your things a long distance. If you your new apartment is only across town, you would say that you're moving your things to your new place.</p></div>`;
