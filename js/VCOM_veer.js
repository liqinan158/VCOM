You can veer toward an attractive person at a party, leaving your friends mid-sentence. You veer away from an oncoming truck on the highway to avoid getting crushed. Originally, <i>veer</i> described a change in the direction of the wind, but as you can see, today, anyone or anything that changes direction veers.</p></div></div>`;
