Today it's more common to see a  <i>wimple</i> in a costume shop.</p><p class="long">In "The Canterbury Tales," Chaucer describes both the Prioress and the Wife of Bath as both wearing wimples. It was considered proper during early medieval times for a married woman to cover her hair, and the use of wimples grew out of this custom. Married women no longer wore wimples after the fifteenth century, but they became an important part of a Catholic nun's traditional clothing.</p></div></div>`;
