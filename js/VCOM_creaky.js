If your front door is <i>creaky</i>, its hinges might need to be oiled.</p><p class="long">The sound of footsteps on a creaky wood floor, or climbing your creaky stairs, can be spooky at night. You can also describe a hoarse or high-pitched voice as creaky, and your grandfather might sigh, "Oh, these <i>creaky</i> old knees," when he stands up. <i>Creaky</i> describes the grating sound, and also the worn out or run-down nature of old things or people. It comes from <i>creak</i>, which is imitative â€” its sound suggests its meaning.</p></div></div>`;
