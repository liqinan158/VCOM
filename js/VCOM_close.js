You could <i>close</i> a door, <i>close</i> your mouth, or even <i>close</i> a deal.</p><p class="long">This versatile word usually means "the end" or "near." When a store is closed, you can't go in: the door is closed and locked. When people are close, they are right next to each other â€” or they're emotionally close to one another. In baseball, the closer is a pitcher who tries to end the game. If your flight had "a <i>close</i> call," it almost crashed. You can close a program on a computer, and you close your eyes when you go to sleep after reading this.</p></div></div>`;
