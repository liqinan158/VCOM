Sometimes <i>marzipan</i> is dyed with food coloring and shaped into fruit, animals, or people â€” so if your niece loves going to the zoo, you might top her birthday cake with <i>marzipan</i> elephants and lions.</p><p class="long">You can buy marzipan in a tube or roll from stores that sell baking supplies. It can be rolled out into thin sheets and used as icing, covered in chocolate, or mixed into breads and cakes like stollen and Louisiana king cake. If you love the flavor of almonds, you'll probably like marzipan. It was originally called <i>marchpane</i> and was even mentioned in <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i> Experts think the word derives from <i>martius panis</i>, or "bread of March" in Latin.</p></div>`;
