Or, it is a slang term for a bicycle. If you ride a <i>cycle</i> to work, we suggest putting your clothes through the wash <i>cycle</i> twice — or wear strong cologne.</p><p class="long">We get <i>cycle</i>  from Latin <i>cyclus</i> and Greek <i>kuklos</i>, both meaning "circle." So you can see where <i>bi-</i> (two) and <i>tri-</i> (three) + <i>cycle</i> got their names. Nowadays, <i>cycle</i> can be a verb or a noun: You can ride a cycle or you can cycle to the park. The same holds true when you’re talking about a sequence of repeating events: The seasons cycle through spring, summer, fall, and winter. The plant life cycle goes from seed to flower to seed dispersal.</p></div></div>`;
