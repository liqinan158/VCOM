In Superman comics, the <i>antagonist</i> is Lex Luthor, evil genius and archenemy of the superhero.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>antagonist</i> shows up a lot when people are talking about books, plays, or movies to mean "the bad guy," but it can also be used to talk about a real person if she acts against someone else. An antagonist is always in opposition, but she isn't always bad or mean; your opponent on the tennis court, for example, could be called your <i>antagonist</i>, simply because it is her priority to beat you in your tennis game.</p></div>`;
