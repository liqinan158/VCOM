Your aunt might nix your idea about a surprise party for your uncle, knowing he would hate it, and a babysitter might nix her charges' plan to stay up all night watching movies. Another, less formal meaning of <i>nix</i> is "nothing." This is also the oldest meaning of the word, from the German <i>nichts</i>, also "nothing," and pronounced in much the same way.</p></div></div>`;
