var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">deject</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>deject</i> is to make someone feel really, really sad. Few things will <i>deject</i> you more than losing your very favorite scarf — the one your grandmother knit — on the subway.</p><p class="long">This verb is rarely used these days, so you're most likely to find it in an old book— the adjective <i>dejected</i> is much more common. Both words come from the earlier verb <i>dejecten</i>, "to throw or cast down," from the Latin <i>deicere</i>, "to cast down, destroy, or defeat." The more figurative "make sad" meaning appeared around 1500. If you really want to deject someone, play them some melancholy music when they're already sad about their lost cat.</p></div>`;
