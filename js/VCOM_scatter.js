If you have clothes strewn all over your room, you might say there is a scatter of clothes on the floor. More commonly, though, <i>scatter</i> is used as a verb meaning “to spread about.” You might scatter grass seed on your front lawn in the spring. <i>Scatter</i> can also mean “break up or disperse.” The police, for instance, might scatter an unruly mob or gathering.</p></div></div>`;
