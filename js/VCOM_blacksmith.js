Working as a <i>blacksmith</i> involves heating metal then bending and hammering it into the desired shape.</p><p class="long">Blacksmiths mainly work with iron and steel, heating it until it's soft enough to bend, fold, and shape using tools. A blacksmith can make things like wrought iron fences and gates, knives and other cooking utensils, and metal light fixtures. While today many metal items once made by blacksmiths are mass produced in factories, there's a renewed interest in learning to make metal objects by hand.</p></div></div>`;
