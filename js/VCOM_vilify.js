One way to remember the word is to think about how it sounds â€” like the word <i>villain</i> (which is unrelated and comes from <i>villa</i>). This suggests that when you vilify someone, you make them sound villainous. So avoid spreading vile words that vilify another and make him or her seem like a villain.</p></div>`;
