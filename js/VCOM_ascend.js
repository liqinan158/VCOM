You can do this literally, like when you <i>ascend</i> to 35,000 feet after your plane takes off, or figuratively, like when you win the lottery and <i>ascend</i> to a higher social class.</p><p class="long">Riding the escalators in the department store is one way to amuse yourself while your parents shop. You can <i>ascend</i> all the way to the 8th floor, and then descend back to the ground floor. Both <i>ascend</i> and <i>descend</i> come from the Latin verb <i>scandere</i>, which means "to climb." It's the prefixes that make all the difference. The <i>a-</i> of <i>ascend</i> makes the word mean "climb up," while the <i>de-</i> of its antonym makes <i>descend</i> mean "climb down."</p></div>`;
