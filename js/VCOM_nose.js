Dogs' noses give them even more information, about where their owners have been or which neighbor cats have been hanging out in their yards. If someone says you "have a <i>nose</i>" for something, they mean you're talented at it. As a verb, <i>nose</i> means to pry or meddle, or for an animal to push its nose against or into something.</p></div>`;
