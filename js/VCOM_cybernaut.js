It's becoming more and more rare to meet anyone who isn't a <i>cybernaut</i> these days.</p><p class="long">Cybernauts tend to spend time online interacting socially in forums and through social media. At one time, cybernauts were thought of as adventurous explorers of a new realm — the Internet — but increasingly there are few people who can't call themselves cybernauts. The earliest use of the word referred to users of any computer technology, especially virtual reality, borrowing from <i>astronaut</i> and adding the prefix <i>cyber-</i>, used for electronic communication and computer-related words.</p></div>`;
