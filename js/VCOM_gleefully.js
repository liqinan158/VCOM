If two kids call to each other <i>gleefully</i> across the playground, there's laughter and delight in their voices.</p><p class="long">Wedding guests might rush gleefully onto the dance floor when the DJ plays a popular song, and a child who is trick or treating for the first time will often gleefully dress in her ghost costume and even more gleefully watch her plastic pumpkin fill with Halloween candy. The adjective <i>gleeful</i> and related noun <i>glee</i> are at the root of <i>gleefully</i>, all of them sharing the Latin root word <i>gliu</i>, "entertainment, mirth, jest, or play."</p></div></div>`;
