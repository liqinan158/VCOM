In science fiction books and movies, people are called <i>earthlings</i> to distinguish them from aliens. E.T. was definitely not an <i>earthling</i>.</p><p class="long">You're most likely to come across the word <i>earthling</i> in fiction, since we more often refer to ourselves as "people" or "humans," assuming that we are all from Earth. In science fiction, though, some characters come from other planets or galaxies and aren't actually earthlings. <i>Earthling</i> has an Old English root, <i>yr√æling</i>, or "plowman," and in 1949 the author Robert Heinlein first used <i>earthling</i> in a science fiction context.</p></div></div>`;
