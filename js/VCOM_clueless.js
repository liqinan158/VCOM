The unsuspecting victim of a practical joke is usually <i>clueless</i> right up until everyone starts laughing.</p><p class="long">You could reassure your brother that your mom has no idea you're planning a surprise party by saying, "Don't worry, she's totally <i>clueless</i>." Or you might worry that your friend failed the big geometry test, based on the clueless expression on his face during the exam. In the 1860s, <i>clueless</i> meant "leaving no clues behind," but by 1943 it gained its current meaning, which became even more popular as student slang in the 1980s.</p></div>`;
