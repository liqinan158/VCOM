Theater set designers sometimes use <i>trompe l'oeil</i> to create realistic backdrops for plays.</p><p class="long">In French, <i>trompe l'oeil</i> means "fools the eye," from <i>tromper</i>, "to deceive," and <i>l'oeil</i>, "the eye." This perfectly describes what's remarkable about trompe l'oeil; paintings in this style trick your eyes into seeing something with depth, rather than a flat surface. Trompe l'oeil is one of the oldest optical illusions, going as far back as ancient Greek and Roman murals.</p></div>`;
