If a barbershop quartet sings “Happy Birthday” to you, the guy with the lowest voice is singing the <i>bass</i> part. A <i>bass</i> is also a type of saltwater fish.</p><p class="long">The word <i>bass</i> has two main meanings with separate pronunciations — <i>bass</i> with a high vowel sound (like <i>base</i>) ironically refers to very low sounds — bass instruments and singers are in the lowest part of the musical range, like the low rumble of a bass guitar. If you say <i>bass</i> with a low vowel sound, it's a type of fish. That kind of bass doesn’t add much to a harmony but is delicious with mashed potatoes.</p></div>`;
