You might be embarrassed to admit that you don't want to go to the beach with your friends because of how much seagulls <i>scare</i> you.</p><p class="long">Questions on a test you're unprepared for might scare you, and so might a barking dog. To <i>scare</i> is to spook, startle, or cause fear, and what scares your best friend most (like losing his job) might not be what would scare you more than anything (like discovering a huge snake in your shower). You can also use <i>scare</i> as a noun, as in "It gave me such a <i>scare</i> when all my friends jumped out and yelled, 'Surprise!'"</p></div>`;
