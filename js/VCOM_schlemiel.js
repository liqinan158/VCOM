You might angrily call your brother a <i>schlemiel</i> after he drops the cake you've spent all day making, stumbles, and sits on it.</p><p class="long">Nothing every goes quite right for a schlemiel â€” he's the guy who never seems to get any good luck, and who's less than brilliant and not particularly graceful. A schlemiel in a movie is an object of fun, perfect for laughing at. In real life, it's pretty hard to be a schlemiel. The word <i>schlemiel</i> means "bungler" in Yiddish, from a character called <i>Peter Schlemihl</i> in a classic German fable.</p></div></div>`;
