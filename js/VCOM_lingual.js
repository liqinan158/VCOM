The <i>lingual</i> side of your teeth is the side closest to your tongue.</p><p class="long">If you fall and bite your tongue, you suffer a lingual injury, and when you brush your tongue after finishing with your teeth, you could call it a lingual cleaning. Because speech sounds are formed with the help of the tongue, things related to language are also <i>lingual</i>. A skilled lingual learner is good at picking up languages, for example. The Latin root, <i>lingua</i>, unsurprisingly, means "tongue."</p></div>`;
