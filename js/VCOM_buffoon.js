var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">buffoon</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>buffoon</i> is someone whose ridiculous behavior is a source of amusement to others. People you might call a <i>buffoon</i> are a political rival or the guy at work who tells silly jokes at office parties.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>buffoon</i> has changed its spelling over the years, but not really its meaning. In Middle French, it was <i>bouffon</i>, which came from the Italian <i>buffone</i>, meaning "jester." The original root is the Latin <i>buffare</i>. Think of the stereotypical court jester, the person who makes jokes and falls about trying to make the king laugh â€” he's paid to be a buffoon.</p></div>`;
