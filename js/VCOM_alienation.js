Your political views might cause you to feel a sense of alienation from the rest of your family, or your vegetarianism could result in alienation from your meat-eating friends. The Latin word for <i>alien</i> is <i>alienus</i>, "belonging to another." That idea of not belonging, or not fitting in, gave rise to the Latin verb <i>alienare</i>, "to estrange," which <i>alienation</i> comes from.</p></div></div>`;
