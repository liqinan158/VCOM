When something is morally and ethically sound, it's <i>just</i>. If you are a <i>just</i> teacher, you won't give your student an F just because his mother is rude to you.</p><p class="long"><i>Just</i> might remind you of the word <i>justice</i>. When we describe a person, a rule, or a war as just, we mean that whatever has been done has been done for good reasons, and is fair to all sides. <i>Just</i> can also mean "only" or "simply." If swimming scares you, try the kiddie pool â€” it's just 3 feet deep. If you startle someone, say, "don't worry, it's just me." And something that happened only moments ago just happened.</p></div></div>`;
