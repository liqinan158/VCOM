Now <i>pall</i> usually means that an event or situation is — literally or figuratively — covered in gloom, like disappointing news that casts a <i>pall</i> on your day.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>pall</i> comes from the Latin word, <i>pallium</i>, “covering or cloak.”  This use of <i>pall</i> has come to mean "gloom" like your grandparents' not being there to celebrate with you that casts a pall over your graduation. The verb <i>pall</i> is used when someone or something becomes boring or less interesting over time. Your initial willingness to perform household chores began to <i>pall</i> when you realized that no one else was willing to chip in.</p></div>`;
