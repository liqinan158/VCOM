It's even more than a long, hard look. To <i>scrutinize</i> something, you have to look at it really critically, investigating every nook and cranny. Often things are scrutinized to verify if they're correct or authentic. So it makes perfect sense that this verb is rooted in the Latin word <i>scrutari</i>, which means “to search.”</p></div></div>`;
