If youâ€™ve recently decided that the earth may be round, you are <i>shifting</i> from a flat-Earth viewpoint to a round-Earth one.</p><p class="long"><i>Shifting</i> can be used in several senses, but the constant in all of them is change and movement. For example, <i>shifting</i> can describe moving earth: it is usually a bad idea to build your house on a plot of shifting land. The word can also refer to something that is regularly changing: Your friend whose favorite music regularly alternates from heavy metal to jazz to Chinese opera? She has a shifting taste in music.</p></div></div>`;
