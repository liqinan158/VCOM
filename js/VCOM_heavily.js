var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">heavily</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Anything that happens <i>heavily</i> is weighty, extensive, or labored. A car falling off its jack will crash <i>heavily</i> to the ground, and if you are a new runner, you'll be breathing <i>heavily</i> after the first mile.</p><p class="long">Sometimes the adverb <i>heavily</i> simply describes the action of something <i>heavy</i> â€” like kids' feet pounding heavily up the stairs, or an airplane landing heavily on the runway. There's also the "large amount" or "a lot" meaning, like when rain falls heavily or a director is heavily influenced by the cartoons of her childhood. Breathing heavily, on the other hand, means "with effort."</p></div></div>`;
