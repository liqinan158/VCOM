If you're having a terrible day, you probably wish you could just go home, get in bed, and <i>cuddle</i> with your cat.</p><p class="long"><i>Cuddle</i> might come from the Middle English <i>couth</i>, "known" â€” after all, you only cuddle with those you know. Or, <i>cuddle</i> may have started as baby talk that caught on. When you cuddle, you give a snuggly hug to make yourself or another person feel loved or comforted. As a noun, <i>cuddle</i> describes the time of the embrace, like having one last cuddle before leaving for a long trip.</p></div>`;
