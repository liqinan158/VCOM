And if you're feeling wobbly during gym class, you probably need to sit down and drink some water. Anything or anyone that <i>wobbles</i> can be described as <i>wobbly</i>, and both words come from a root meaning "to weave back and forth." When the word is capitalized, it's a nickname for a member of the labor union called International Workers of the World.</p></div></div>`;
