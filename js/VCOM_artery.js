For a healthy heart, keep your <i>arteries</i> clean!</p><p class="long">The word <i>artery</i> originally stemmed from the Greek <i>arteria</i>, which means "windpipe." An artery is distinct from a smaller passage that carries blood in the body, called a vein. An artery is more important, as it is larger and collects and dispenses vast amounts of blood to various cells and tissues throughout the body. The word <i>artery</i> can also refer to a major route of transportation that absorbs the flow of local routes, like a highway or an interstate.</p></div></div>`;
