var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">homograph</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the noun <i>homograph</i> to talk about two words that are spelled the same but have different meanings and are pronounced differently â€” like <i>sow</i>, meaning "female pig," and <i>sow</i>, "to plant seeds."</p><p class="long">The word <i>homograph</i> merges <i>homos</i>, the Greek word for "same," with <i>graph</i>, "to write." If two words are written identically but don't share a meaning, they are homographs. Some examples are <i>close</i> ("to shut") and <i>close</i> ("nearby"); and <i>bass</i> ("deep") and <i>bass</i> ("the fish"). Homographs are confusing at first glance, but once you read them in the context of a sentence or hear them spoken aloud, you'll easily figure out which word is intended.</p></div>`;
