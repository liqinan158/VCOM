It can be a peaceful place to visit, but watch out for nasty surprises dropping from birds overhead.</p><p class="long"><i>Aviary</i> is formed from the Latin word for bird, <i>avis,</i> and the ending <i>-ary,</i> meaning “a place” (similar to the <i>-arium</i> in <i>aquarium</i>). Unlike birdcages for pets, aviaries are large enough to allow the captive birds room to fly around. They are often large enough for people to enter too. Be sure not to confuse <i>aviary</i> with <i>apiary,</i> which is a place for keeping bees, not birds.</p></div></div>`;
