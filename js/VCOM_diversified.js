If your investments are <i>diversified</i>, it means you have put money in more than one place: real estate, stocks, bonds, race horses, gold, alligator farms, and so on.</p><p class="long"><i>Diverse</i> comes from a medieval Latin word <i>diversificare</i>, meaning “make dissimilar.” If you have diversified something, you have made its parts different from each other. For example, if you want to make your diet more diversified, you make it a point to eat a wider variety of foods, or at least something beyond just scrambled eggs and macaroni and cheese.</p></div></div>`;
