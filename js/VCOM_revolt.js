You might see an opposition group <i>revolt</i> against a government, or you might <i>revolt</i> against your oppressive 10:00 curfew.</p><p class="long"><i>Revolt</i> has a noun form as well to describe that kind of rebellious uprising. Your revolt is successful if you get permission to stay out past 11:00. <i>Revolt</i> can also mean to disgust or sicken, either physically or in terms of your sensibilities. Your stomach may revolt at the idea of eating cauliflower again. You could combine the two meanings of <i>revolt</i> if you stage a revolt in the kitchen to stop from having to eat vegetables that revolt you.</p></div></div>`;
