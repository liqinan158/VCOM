You can use <i>odd</i> for a single thing that belongs in a pair, like an <i>odd</i> sock or <i>odd</i> mitten. If someone wants you to do <i>odd jobs</i>, that could mean almost anything: odd jobs are random and unpredictable jobs that could come up. When you describe a person as odd, or that they’re exhibiting odd behavior, it means they're peculiar and out of the ordinary.</p></div></div>`;
