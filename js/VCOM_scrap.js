You might jot down notes on a <i>scrap</i> of paper, or you might toss a <i>scrap</i> of food to your happy dog.</p><p class="long">A scrap is typically a small item that originally was part of something larger, like a scrap of fabric that was once part of a larger piece. <i>Scrap</i> can also describe something that’s no longer useful. For example, you might take scrap metal to the recycling center. A final meaning of the noun <i>scrap</i> is "fight," as in "I got into a scrap with my brother." <i>Scrap</i> also has a verb form that means "discard." When you scrap your plan to move to the Bahamas, that means you’re abandoning the plan.</p></div></div>`;
