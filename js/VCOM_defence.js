If you're in court charged with a crime, you (and your lawyer, if you have one) are called "the <i>defence</i>."  If your only defence is that you were sleepwalking when you robbed a gas station, you might be going away for awhile.  If you play defence in a team sport, your main job is to keep the other team from scoring (so stay wide awake).</p></div></div>`;
