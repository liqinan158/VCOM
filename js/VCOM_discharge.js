You'd probably like being <i>discharged</i> from jail, but not from your job, unless you really hate it.</p><p class="long">As a verb, <i>discharge</i> is “to release,” and as a noun, it refers to the act of or setting free. You'd be discharged from the hospital once the discharge from your wound has stopped. Ew. The writer Ambrose Bierce jokingly defined <i>emotion</i> as "a prostrating disease caused by a determination of the heart to the head. It is sometimes accompanied by a copious discharge of hydrated chloride of sodium from the eyes.” Wouldn't want to cry in front of that guy!</p></div></div>`;
