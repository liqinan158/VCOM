If you think there’s no way you can pass your math exam and studying won’t change anything, then you’re <i>fatalistic</i>.</p><p class="long">When you pronounce <i>fatalistic</i>, you can hear the word <i>fate</i>. That’s a clue that <i>fatalistic</i> is in some way related to fate — as in destiny. A fatalistic person believes in destiny: whatever is meant to happen will happen. <i>Fatalistic</i> often relates to bad things. If someone has a fatalistic attitude toward a situation, chances are that means the person is expecting things to turn out badly and sees no point in trying to change that outcome.</p></div>`;
