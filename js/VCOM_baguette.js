Your mom might ask you to buy a <i>baguette</i> at the bakery on your way home for dinner.</p><p class="long">Baguettes are distinctive because of their shape, and if they're baked well, they have a crisp crust and a soft interior. In the 1700s, the word <i>baguette</i> referred only to rod-like architectural details, though by the mid-20th century, it also meant "bread." In French, <i>baguette</i> means "wand, rod, or baton," and it appears in "magic wand," or <i>baguette magique</i>, as well as "chopsticks," <i>baguettes chinoises</i>.</p></div>`;
