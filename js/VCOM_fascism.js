Your parents' rule that you must be home by midnight might seem like <i>fascism</i>, but Europeans will tell you that it could be a lot worse.</p><p class="long">The word <i>fascism</i> can be hard to spell, so remember that the <i>c</i> comes after the <i>s</i>. <i>Fascism</i> comes from the Latin <i>fascio</i>, meaning “bundle, or political group.” In fascism, the people are looked at as a bundle — one body that must be controlled by the government with absolute force. There’s no option to vote, no chance to impeach a leader, and no freedom to stand up against the governing body.</p></div></div>`;
