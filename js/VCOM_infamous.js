If you're bad but unknown, then you're not infamous â€” it's reserved for those wicked and well-known people that capture our collective imagination.  It is a strong and resonant term. Some synonyms are <i>notorious, disgraceful,</i> and <i>odious</i>. The stress is on the first syllable.</p></div></div>`;
