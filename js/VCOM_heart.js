If we go back even further, however, we see the word also has ties to the Greek <i>kardia</i>, which makes sense when we consider that the prefix <i>cardio</i> refers to the <i>heart</i>. For example, a cardio workout is one that gets the heart pumping harder, and a cardiologist is a doctor of the <i>heart</i>.  If someone asks that you "have a heart," however, they are appealing to your sense of generosity not to the blood-pumping organ.</p></div></div>`;
