It's one thing to <i>disassemble</i> a computer; it's a whole other thing to put it back together again.</p><p class="long">If you take your car to the repair shop to have a squeaky brake fixed, you'll be surprised to see the mechanics quickly disassemble your car, removing even its wheels and doors. You can use the word <i>disassemble</i> whenever something's dismantled or broken into pieces. Originally, <i>disassemble</i> meant "to disperse," or to stop a crowd of people from assembling, but the meaning changed to its current definition in the 1600s.</p></div>`;
