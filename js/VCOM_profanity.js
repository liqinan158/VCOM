Swear words, obscene gestures, and naughty jokes are all considered <i>profanity</i>.</p><p class="long">You know those four-letter words you're not supposed to say? They're profanity: language that's vulgar and obscene. R-rated movies and cable stations like HBO have a lot of profanity, but you won't hear it on a station like NBC or ABC. Profanity tends to be about off-color subjects, like sex and going to the bathroom. Everyone probably spews some profanity at some point, but you better be careful about who's listening.</p></div></div>`;
