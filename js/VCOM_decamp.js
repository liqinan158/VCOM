If your rent in Brooklyn keeps going up, you may decide to <i>decamp</i> to New Jersey.</p><p class="long">Use the verb <i>decamp</i> when people scram — especially when they relocate a household or a business to a new location. You'll probably be disappointed when your favorite pizza place decamps to another neighborhood, or if your best friend's family decamps to Canada. The word was originally a military term, literally meaning "leave camp," from the French <i>décamper</i>, from <i>des-</i>, "apart or away," and <i>camp</i>, "open space for military exercises."</p></div>`;
