If you leave your ice cream in the freezer too long, you may find a coating of ice <i>crystals</i> on top.</p><p class="long">Some people think that certain natural crystals — quartz, for instance — have mystical properties and if you wear them or hold them, they cure whatever’s wrong with you. <i>Crystal</i> is also the word for transparent glass made of silica, and it's also a name for fine glassware — the kind that reverberates with a nice ping when you flick your fingernail against it. Another kind of <i>crystal</i> is the glass cover that protects the face of your watch.</p></div>`;
