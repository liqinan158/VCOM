Or maybe you just hate changing diapers.</p><p class="long">You usually try to console someone by providing encouragement and offering solace. Others try to console themselves with tubs of ice cream. From the Latin word <i>consolari</i>, meaning “to comfort,”  the noun <i>console</i> can also describe a central control panel. In an automobile, the controls for both the radio and air-conditioning are in the same center console.</p></div>`;
