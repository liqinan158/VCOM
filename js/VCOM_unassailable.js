If you are going to get home late (again!), you'd better have an <i>unassailable</i> alibi for your parents, or else you should plan on not seeing the outside of your room for a while.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>unassailable</i> also means immune to attack or doubt, such as an unassailable military holding or an unassailable reputation. <i>Unassailable</i> can also mean untouchable or unable to be defeated. If your high school basketball team is leading 92 to 14 with just a couple of seconds to go, the announcer might say you have an unassailable lead. The corrupt politician had so many connections, he seemed unassailable; he always seemed to manage to deflect even a hint of scandal onto others in the party.</p></div>`;
