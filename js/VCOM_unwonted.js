Nowadays, <i>unwonted</i> is a pretty <i>unwonted</i> word itself.</p><p class="long"><i>Unwonted</i> was once a particularly beloved literary term, favored by authors like Henry James and Charles Dickens, whose books were filled with "unwonted circumstances," and the like. Not to be confused — as it often is — with <i>unwanted,</i> meaning not wanted or desired. The confusion arises not just because the words sound identical, but because their meanings overlap: it's a safe bet that anything unwonted is generally unwanted, too.</p></div>`;
