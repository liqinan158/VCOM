var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">adroit</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Someone who is <i>adroit</i> is clever and skillful. An <i>adroit</i> leader will be able to persuade people to go with his ideas. An <i>adroit</i> sculptor can turn a lump of clay into an object of great beauty.</p><p class="long">If you've ever studied French you know that <i>droit</i> means "right," both as in "right of free speech" and as in "left and right," and <i>à droit</i> means both "turn right" and "properly." Once English people borrowed <i>à droit,</i> they changed the meaning slightly, from doing something "properly" to "doing something well." You may have heard the expression "surprisingly <i>adroit</i>," as in, "For a guy whose wife does all the cooking, he is surprisingly <i>adroit</i> in the kitchen."</p></div>`;
