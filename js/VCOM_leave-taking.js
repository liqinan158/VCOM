Hugging your visitors goodbye, waving as their car departs â€” these are all parts of leave-taking. It can be simple and polite, like when you say goodbye to co-workers at the end of the day, or a more poignant leave-taking, like when you leave your entire family to travel in Africa for a year.</p></div>`;
