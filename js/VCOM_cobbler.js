A <i>cobbler</i> is also a type of fruit pie. Context is everything with this word! If you give a pie a broken shoe, don’t expect results.</p><p class="long">Cobblers mend shoes. If your heel is falling off or there’s a rip in your shoe, a cobbler can help you out. These days, people are more likely to buy a new pair of shoes than fix an old one, but cobblers used to be very common. A cobbler is also a delicious pie with rich biscuit dough on top and fruit underneath. Apple cobbler and peach cobbler are extra yummy with ice cream on top.</p></div>`;
