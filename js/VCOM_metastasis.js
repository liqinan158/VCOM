It means an illness has spread to new parts of the body.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>metastasis</i> is a medical term that's most often used to describe a spreading cancer. If a patient's lung cancer spreads to his heart or to his lymph nodes, that is metastasis. It's a Greek word meaning "transference or change." In Latin, the word <i>metastasis</i> was at one time used to mean "a sudden transition in subjects," but ever since the 1660s, the English use has been almost entirely medical.</p></div></div>`;
