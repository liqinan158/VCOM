Other things, like linoleum, have a smooth texture. Texture has to do with how an object feels and it's ingredients. Texture is very important in clothes: a cotton shirt has a different texture than a polyester shirt. You can also talk about other kinds of texture, like musical texture. A symphony and a rock song have different instruments, so they have different textures.</p></div>`;
