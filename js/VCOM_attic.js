It’s often the setting for creepy stories because it’s a room people don’t go in very often.</p><p class="long">A finished attic is extra space you can use for a playroom, bedroom, or storage area. In fiction, it’s a great place to stash crazy people. In Charlotte Bronte’s book <i>Jane Eyre</i>, there’s a madwoman in the attic. Some attics don't even have floors that can be walked on, though — they're just empty space at the top of a house. An <i>attic</i> was originally called an <i>attic storey</i>, from the architectural term <i>Attic order</i>.</p></div></div>`;
