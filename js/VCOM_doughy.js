If your cookies always come out a little <i>doughy</i>, you might not be baking them long enough.</p><p class="long">Some foods are deliberately doughy, like a very soft steamed dumpling or a delicious doughy doughnut. Others are doughy by accident, because they've been undercooked or made incorrectly. You can describe other things as <i>doughy</i> too, if they're cushiony â€” a kitten might purr as it kneads its mother's doughy belly, for example. <i>Doughy</i> comes from <i>dough</i>, with its Indo-European root meaning "smear" or "knead."</p></div></div>`;
