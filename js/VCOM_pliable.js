Wax is <i>pliable</i>, good leather is <i>pliable</i>.  If you describe a person as <i>pliable</i>, it usually means that he's easily influenced, like a nightclub owner who takes orders from a crime boss.</p><p class="long">When Madame barks "Plier!" (rhymes with "okay") in ballet class, all the students obediently bend their knees into a graceful semi-crouch. <i>Plier</i> is French for bend and it's the root of the word <i>pliable</i>. The word <i>pliable</i> itself is quite pliable, an apt description for everything from building materials to a person's character.</p></div>`;
