You want the dressing on the side, you want your collar just so, and you want the place mats arranged at a 90-degree angle.</p><p class="long">The word <i>fussy</i> came into English in the 19th century, but it’s a good bet that people have been fussy since the beginning of time. If you’re fussy, you’re really picky about your needs and requirements. You might be fussy about your food and refuse to eat cauliflower. You’re rarely satisfied — that can be annoying! <i>Fussy</i> can also describe something that has too much going on, like a fussy shirt that has ruffles, buttons, and a large floral pattern.</p></div>`;
