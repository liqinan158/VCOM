If you're a baker, you might know that regular, all-purpose flour is often chemically treated â€” while <i>unbleached</i> flour is not.</p><p class="long">The word <i>unbleached</i> comes from adding the prefix <i>un-</i> ("not") to <i>bleached</i>, which stems from a root word that means "shining white." You'll almost always find this adjective describing things that might typically be bleached. For example, fabric and paper are often lightened with chemicals, but unbleached cotton fabric and unbleached writing paper are not.</p></div></div>`;
