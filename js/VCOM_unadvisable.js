It's <i>unadvisable</i> to invite your whole class to a sleepover without asking your parents first.</p><p class="long">You can use the adjectives <i>unadvisable</i> and <i>inadvisable</i> interchangeably. In this case, the prefixes <i>un-</i> and <i>in-</i> both mean "not." And <i>advisable</i>, though it originally meant "open to advice," is defined as "prudent or wise." So if something seems unwise or irresponsible, you can call it unadvisable: "Riding your skateboard while you hang onto that car's bumper is unadvisable."</p></div>`;
