For example, your easy sense of humor and way of making people feel comfortable make you <i>appealing</i> to friends old and new.</p><p class="long">If you are appealing, people want to be around you. It might be that you are really nice, or a good listener, not to mention have good looks. Actors who are appealing tend to get a lot of parts because filmmakers know audiences will flock to see them, just as an appealing description of a dish on a menu will lead more people to order it. This something is appealing, it is — or will be — popular.</p></div>`;
