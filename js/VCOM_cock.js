A <i>cock</i> is a rooster, but it's also the hammer on a gun that you adjust so you can fire it.</p><p class="long">You might hear the word <i>cock</i> used to mean "penis," but that's a vulgar form of the word, so be sure you're in the right company if you opt to use it. A cock is a male bird, particularly a rooster. When you cock a gun, you raise its cock to make it ready for firing. When you cock something in a certain direction, you are tilting it that way.</p></div></div>`;
