Even if you're in awe of your Aunt Sally's glamorous, single life, your grandmother might dismiss her as a <i>spinster</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Spinster</i> originally meant "a spinner of thread," and as that was a job typically done by unmarried women, it came to have the meaning — even in legal documents — of "single woman." Another term for <i>spinster</i> is the equally old-fashioned sounding <i>old maid</i>. Either way, it means a woman who never got married. <i>Spinster</i> is not a word you should call anyone: it reduces single women to one detail about their lives.</p></div></div>`;
