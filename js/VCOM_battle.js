Perhaps you have heard someone tell you, after winning the first of many dance competitions, "You may have won the <i>battle</i>, but you haven’t won the war!" A battle doesn’t have to occur between two individuals or groups. You may endure an inner battle to cut down on junk food. If you skip those fries for lunch today, then you have won a small battle.</p></div></div>`;
