Oh dear, you were guilty of certitude â€” an absolute conviction that the outcome of the game did not support. In other words, you were a tad cocky. <i>Certitude</i> is very similar to <i>certainty,</i> and often used interchangeably, but there's a hint of danger about certitude; someone who displays it may well be overconfident. Certainty is more certain.</p></div>`;
