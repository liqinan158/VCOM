The Romans would always look for good omens to mark the beginning of something — a war, or a new emperor’s reign — so <i>inaugurate</i> became linked to new beginnings. While <i>inaugurate</i> has long been used in formal contexts, such as the swearing-in ceremony that inaugurates a President's term in office, the word is now also used casually. You might inaugurate your marathon training with a long run.</p></div></div>`;
