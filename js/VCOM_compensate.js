If you step in an unmarked pothole, the city may <i>compensate</i> you by paying your doctor bills treating a broken ankle.</p><p class="long"><i>Compensate</i> can also mean "to adjust for." So, if you did stumble into the pothole and injure your left leg, then you might <i>compensate</i> by leaning heavily on your right leg. Increasingly, <i>compensate</i> is used in place of <i>pay</i>. Day laborers are paid for their time, but executives are more likely to be <i>compensated</i> with a suite that includes salary and other benefits––what is commonly referred to as a <i>compensation</i> package.</p></div>`;
