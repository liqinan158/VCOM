In Europe and Asia, a <i>caribou</i> is known as a reindeer.</p><p class="long">In North America, caribou live in parts of Canada and Alaska, in both tundra and boreal forests. Many caribou migrate long distances, and all of them are herbivores, living to a great degree on a specific type of lichen. The word <i>caribou</i> is originally French Canadian, from the Micmac word <i>kaleboo</i>, "the one who paws," for the way caribou scratch the snow aside to find moss in the winter.</p></div></div>`;
