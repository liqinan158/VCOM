You could chuck pieces of bread in the direction of some ducks on a pond, or chuck a Frisbee around with friends after class. You can also chuck something away, or throw it away: "My old diaries? Oh, I decided to <i>chuck</i> those out." If a butcher talks about a <i>chuck</i> or a <i>chuck</i> roast, he means a shoulder cut of meat.</p></div>`;
