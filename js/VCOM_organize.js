Your family might not understand the way you <i>organize</i> your kitchen if you keep shoelaces, dental floss, and a screwdriver in your silverware drawer.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>organize</i> also means to plan or orchestrate something. If you've agreed to organize the German club's bake sale, you'll probably spend some serious time transporting cupcakes and linzer torte to school. When a group of workers forms a union, this action is also described with the verb <i>organize</i>. The International Ladies Garment Workers Union, for example, was organized in 1900 in New York City by immigrant factory workers.</p></div>`;
