An invisible electric fence is an excellent <i>deterrence</i> for dogs who like to roam outside the yard.</p><p class="long">You can influence someone's actions by promoting certain behaviors and discouraging others. And it's the discouragement part where deterrence comes in. A deterrence makes you reconsider doing something — usually bad things like stealing or skipping school — because you know the penalty will be harsh. Deterrences make you afraid to try something. So many homeowners hope that a security alarm will be a deterrence to burglars.</p></div></div>`;
