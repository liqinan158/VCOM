var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">construe</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If you interpret something or make sense of it, you <i>construe</i> its meaning. If the new girl in your class asks to sit with you at lunch, you could <i>construe</i> that she wants to be friends. You can never have too many friends!</p><p class="long">To make an assumption based on evidence is to <i>construe</i>. You could construe that eating an entire box of cookies might make you feel a bit sick. And you might not want to eat them again for a very long time. The opposite of <i>construe</i> is <i>misconstrue</i>, which means to falsely or wrongly interpret. If you get a poor grade on an essay, you shouldn't construe that your teacher dislikes you. If you do, you misconstrue your work for his feelings.</p></div>`;
