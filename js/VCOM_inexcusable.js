When an action is inexcusable, there is no excuse for it. Inexcusable actions and words don't have a justification. Also, this word is used for things that are just plain awful. Most people would say crimes like murder are inexcusable. If a good friend lied to you, you might consider that inexcusable. This is a harsh word for things that we can't forgive or condone.</p></div></div>`;
