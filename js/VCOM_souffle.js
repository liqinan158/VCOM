You might make a fluffy goat cheese <i>souffle</i> to serve your friends at brunch.</p><p class="long">A souffle is similar to an omelet, although it is much lighter and airier, due to beaten egg whites that are folded into the other ingredients. The trick with a souffle is generally keeping it fluffy and not allowing it to fall. You can make a savory souffle or a sweet one, like a chocolate souffle for dessert. The word is French, from <i>souffler</i>, "puff up."</p></div>`;
