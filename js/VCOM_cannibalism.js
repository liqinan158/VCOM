For humans, cannibalism means eating human flesh. This occurs in some primitive societies and among disturbed people such as serial killers. Also, if a group of people are stranded somewhere long enough, they might have to resort to cannibalism to survive. Animals that eat their own kind are also examples of cannibalism. People who engage in cannibalism are called cannibals.</p></div></div>`;
