Most <i>doorbells</i> have a small button that rings a bell inside the house when it's pushed.</p><p class="long">Your doorbell might emit a long chiming ring, even playing part of a song, or it may make a harsh buzzing sound. Doorbells tend to be louder than a simple knock on the door, and often they can be heard throughout a house or apartment. The very first doorbells were developed by the Scottish inventor William Murdock in the early 19th century.</p></div>`;
