An elementary school classroom is bound to be <i>abuzz</i> on the last day of school before summer.</p><p class="long">When a place is abuzz, it's bustling with activity and sounds, humming in a way that resembles the buzzing of bees. The whole town might be abuzz with excitement about a movie being filmed there, or your house could be abuzz with excited children during a birthday party. Charles Dickens is credited with the first written use of this adjective, in his 1859 novel "A Tale of Two Cities."</p></div></div>`;
