Little kids who are missing their front teeth often <i>sibilate</i> too.</p><p class="long">You sibilate to some degree every time you pronounce the letter <i>s</i> â€” the hissing sound itself is called <i>sibilance</i>, or described as <i>sibilant</i>. When your friend tries to catch your attention in the library by saying, "Psst!" she sibilates. And the librarian sibilates too, when he angrily shushes her with a loud "Shhh!" <i>Sibilate</i> comes from the Latin <i>sibilare</i>, "to hiss or whistle."</p></div></div>`;
