You can also use the adjective <i>beneath</i> in a figurative way, to describe something that ranks lower or has a low worth or status: "He didn't want to play soccer at all, because he thought the Junior Varsity team was <i>beneath</i> him." The Old English root is <i>beneoðan</i>, combining <i>be-</i>, "by," and <i>neoðan</i>, "below."</p></div>`;
