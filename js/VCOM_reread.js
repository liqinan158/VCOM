And, if you reread your chemistry notes a few times before a quiz, it'll help you get a good grade. You probably have a favorite book that you reread every once in a while too. Sometimes people use this word as a noun: "Will you give my story a <i>reread</i> before I submit it to the literary magazine?"</p></div></div>`;
