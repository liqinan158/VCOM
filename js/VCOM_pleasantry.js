var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">pleasantry</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">“It’s so nice to see you.”  “Nice weather, yes?”  “You look great in that frog costume.”  Each of the last three sentences is a <i>pleasantry</i>, a warm and kind-hearted bit of small talk.</p><p class="long">It’s no accident that the word <i>pleasant</i> is inside <i>pleasantry</i>, since a pleasantry is a simple, polite, and pleasant remark made in a conversation. Pleasantries aren’t that deep — talking about politics or religion might be outside the pleasantry range, but some good-humored chatting never hurt anyone. You might say some pleasantries to a passerby on the street, when you are introduced to someone new, or if your grandmother asks you a question about your dating life.</p></div></div>`;
