Here's a famous <i>couplet:</i> "Good night! Good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow / That I shall say good night till it be morrow."</p><p class="long">The couplet above comes from Shakespeare's <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, which is a play, not a poem. But Shakespeare often used rhyming couplets at the end of scenes to signal the ending. Couplets are very common in poetry. Often whole poems are written in couplet form â€” two lines of rhyming poetry, followed by two more lines with a different rhyme, and so on. Robert Frost, one of America's great poets, wrote many poems using couplets.</p></div></div>`;
