If you're embarrassed to be caught sniffling during a sappy movie, you can pretend your <i>lachrymation</i> is caused by allergies.</p><p class="long">The word <i>lachrymation</i> comes from the Latin <i>lacryma</i>, "a tear," a root it shares with the more common <i>lachrymose</i>, which means "tearful or sad." Long ago, medical textbooks discussed lachrymation, but it's rarely used today. Still, if you want to impress your friend, you might warn them about the emotional play you want to see together: "I've heard it causes frequent lachrymation â€” you should bring tissues."</p></div></div>`;
