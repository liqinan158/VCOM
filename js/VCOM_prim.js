Many characters in Jane Austen novels are <i>prim</i> and proper.</p><p class="long"><i>Prim</i> describes someone who is so concerned with being proper it becomes almost fake. If you go to the beach on spring break wearing a Victorian bathing costume, you're being prim. Clothes can be prim, too, like that long wool swimsuit. If you're feeling crazy, you can use <i>prim</i> as a verb meaning, "to purse your mouth into a prim expression" â€” like how you prim your lips when you look down your nose at someone using the wrong fork.</p></div></div>`;
