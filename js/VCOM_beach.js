That's a <i>beach,</i> one of the most beautiful places in the world. During a long, stormy winter, a <i>beach</i> can erode and move.</p><p class="long">The word beach can also be used more generally to describe a town or vacation spot along the ocean or sea. In New Jersey, they call it the shore. But in lots of other places, people say they're going to the beach when they mean they are taking a trip to the seaside for vacation. Of course, if you beach your boat, you might not be overjoyed: that means you've run it aground, usually on a choice pile of sand.</p></div>`;
