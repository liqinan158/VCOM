When actors <i>inhabit</i> their roles, they seem to become the characters, no longer actors reciting their lines. It is like they live the life of the character.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>inhabit</i> comes from the Old French <i>enhabiter</i>, meaning “dwell in.” You can inhabit an actual place, like a home, a cave, or a neighborhood. You can also inhabit an imaginary world, like those who choose to inhabit cyberspace with a made-up persona, telling about experiences that are nothing like the person's real life. Actors who truly inhabit their roles sometimes struggle to return to reality after a movie or television show wraps.</p></div></div>`;
