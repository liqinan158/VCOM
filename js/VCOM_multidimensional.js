You might talk about your relationship with the next door neighbor as <i>multidimensional</i> if, say, he's also your teacher, and if his son is married to your older sister.</p><p class="long">Describing something as <i>multidimensional</i> implies that it's complex. You could talk about a multidimensional book filled with intricate themes, characters, plots, and symbols; or you could even call a person <i>multidimensional</i> if she had a particularly complicated personality. The word <i>dimension</i> forms the root of <i>multidimensional</i>, so if you imagine "many dimensions," you'll have a clear idea of what the word means.</p></div></div>`;
