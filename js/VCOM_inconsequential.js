It also describes things that don't make sense in a certain order, "trying to win their votes is <i>inconsequential</i>: the election's over." Something small or minor can be inconsequential too, though the red bump on your nose on picture-day may not seem as inconsequential to you as it does to the photographer.</p></div>`;
