They’re rare now, but according to Joan Jett, in some places you can still “put another dime in the <i>jukebox</i>, baby” if you love rock and roll.</p><p class="long">In the 1930’s, a juke was a small restaurant where people could eat, drink, and dance. “Juking” meant getting rowdy. When a music vending machine came along, people called it a jukebox because they could crank up the music and get rowdy. It's a large, cabinet-type device that you put money in and choose a song. Back in the day, a 45” vinyl single would play, and then there were CDs, but now that everything’s digital, jukeboxes have become quaint.</p></div>`;
