Not to be confused with its popular partner, the concave mirror, which curves inwards. How can you tell which is which? If you look like you're three feet tall and weigh 300 pounds, you're looking in a convex mirror. If you look like you're twelve feet tall weigh 30 pounds, you're looking in a concave mirror.
