Unrivaled things have no <i>rival</i>, or worthy competitor. When a newspaper's coverage of local events is unrivaled, there is no other paper that provides that kind of news. And if a long jumper's record is unrivaled, it means that not only is she the best, but no other athlete has come close to beating her.</p></div></div>`;
