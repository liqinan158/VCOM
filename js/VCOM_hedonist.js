A <i>hedonist</i> values sensual pleasure above all else.</p><p class="long"><i>Hedonist</i> comes from the Greek word <i>hedone</i> "pleasure" and is related to <i>hedys</i>, which means "sweet." Although this noun did not make its first appearance until 1822, the word was created as a reference to an ancient Greek philosophical system known as the Cyrenaic school. The Cyrenaics taught that pleasure — particularly physical pleasure — is the greatest good. If you need some examples of modern day hedonists, think the many celebrities today who are only famous for going to parties.</p></div>`;
