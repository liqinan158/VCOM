You might get a summer job standing on the sidewalk, holding a <i>placard</i> that announces a mattress sale — though it may not be your dream job.</p><p class="long">A concert poster, a storefront notice, a protest sign carried in a rally — each of these is a type of placard. A placard can be as impermanent as a square of cardboard with a scrawled message, and as official as a permanent plaque marking a historic building. The Old French word <i>plaquier</i> is at the root of <i>placard</i>, and it means "to plaster or to lay flat."</p></div>`;
