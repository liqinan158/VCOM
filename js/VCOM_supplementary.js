The word <i>supplement</i> comes from the Latin <i>supplementum</i> for "something added to fix a deficiency" and the suffix <i>-ary</i> means "connected with." Put them together and you have something connected with filling in. The supplementary support of digging a moat around your sand castle might save it from a wave, but that supplementary reading on your syllabus isn't required (although it might save your grade).</p></div></div>`;
