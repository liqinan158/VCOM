Bacon is <i>meat</i>. Cupcakes are not <i>meat</i>.</p><p class="long">You can refer to hamburgers, pork chops, and barbecued ribs as meat. It's okay to call chicken and turkey meat too, although formally it's known as <i>poultry</i>, while the flesh of fish is simply called <i>fish</i>. Sometimes the edible part of a nut is also called <i>meat</i>, although it's 100 percent vegetarian. If your grandmother thinks you're too skinny, she may feed you "to put some <i>meat</i> on your bones." In Old English, <i>mete</i> was just "food."</p></div></div>`;
