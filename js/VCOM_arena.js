Football is usually played in a stadium, while basketball and other sports typically hold their games in arenas. The word <i>arena</i> originally meant "place of combat," and it's sometimes still used this way. Its root is <i>harena</i>, a kind of sand that was supposedly used on the floor during ancient Roman battles to soak up spilled blood.</p></div>`;
