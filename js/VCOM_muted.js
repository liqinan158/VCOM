When you try to listen through the wall at what someone is saying, it's really <i>muted</i> and mumbly, even if you put a glass to your ear.</p><p class="long">When you mute the TV or computer speakers, all of the sound goes quiet, but something described as <i>muted</i> is just toned down or turned down. When you whisper you speak in a muted voice; it's not completely quiet or no one would hear you, but it's quiet enough to muffle the sounds or secrets you share. Muted colors donâ€™t stand out as much as bright ones. Beiges and soft grays are muted, and they're great for showing off bright contrasts like a turquoise scarf or red tie.</p></div>`;
