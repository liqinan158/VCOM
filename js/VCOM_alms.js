The word isn't used much today, but in movies set in the 1800s or earlier, you'll likely see street beggars shouting, "<i>Alms</i> for the poor!"</p><p class="long">The word <i>alms</i> comes from the Greek word <i>eleemosyne</i>, which means "compassion or pity," and is itself from the word <i>eleos</i>, which means "mercy." Related words include <i>almshouse</i> (a poorhouse), <i>almsman</i> (someone who receives charitable <i>alms</i>), and <i>alms chest</i> (a box in a church used for the purpose of collecting money for the poor). None of these words are very common today.</p></div></div>`;
