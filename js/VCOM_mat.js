You might buy a sea grass mat to put in your bedroom, or a door mat for your apartment entryway. You can also use the word <i>mat</i> as a verb, to mean tangle or snarl: "The dog managed to <i>mat</i> the fur on his belly by rolling around on the beach." The Old English <i>matte</i> came from the Latin word <i>matta</i>, "mat made of rushes."</p></div>`;
