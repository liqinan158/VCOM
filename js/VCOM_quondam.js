You might describe your <i>quondam</i>, or former, Latin tutor to your current Latin tutor, for example.</p><p class="long">English has many ways of saying "former," including <i>quondam</i>, which is the word of choice if you want to sound a bit literary. You may be able to impress a quondam teacher, date, or employer with it. The word <i>quondam</i> comes directly from Latin, with the meaning of "formerly," and it's been used in English since the 1530's.</p></div>`;
