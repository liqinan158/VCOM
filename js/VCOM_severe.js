The common usage is to describe tough or painful stuff, like icy snowstorms, merciless punishments, or grim conditions (e.g., a severe depression). If things are severe, they're serious. <i>Severe</i> could also describe a person's haircut if it's brutally short and angular, or their wardrobe if it tends to be all black with no flourishes.</p></div></div>`;
