Most <i>nuns</i> spend their time praying or meditating and doing service work in their communities.</p><p class="long">You may picture a Catholic nun when you hear the word <i>nun</i>, but there are nuns of other faiths as well, including Hindus, Lutherans, Jains, and Buddhists. Nuns serve the poor and hungry, sometimes running schools or orphanages, and they have in common a strict dedication to religion. <i>Nun</i> comes from the Old English <i>nunne</i>, and the Late Latin <i>nonna</i>, "nun," originally a generic word for addressing an older person.</p></div>`;
