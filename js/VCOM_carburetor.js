Many vehicles, including some small airplanes, have <i>carburetors</i>.</p><p class="long">Newer cars, which tend to have fuel injected engines, no longer have carburetors, but there are still plenty of cars and trucks on the road that do. An engine with a carburetor is called an internal combustion engine, and it relies on the carburetor to mix fuel and air in the right proportion. The word itself comes from the now-obsolete <i>carburet</i>, "combine or charge with a hydrocarbon."</p></div>`;
