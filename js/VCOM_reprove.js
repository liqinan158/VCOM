To <i>reprove</i> is to scold, reprimand, or — in plain English — “chew out.”</p><p class="long"><i>Reprove</i> is a verb used in the same way as “scold,” or “dress down.” To <i>reprove</i> is to express your dissatisfaction or disapproval with something. It’s a less severe word than <i>denounce</i> or <i>decry</i>. It is closer to the verb <i>criticize</i>. Your parents might reprove you for a minor offense like not cleaning your room or chewing with your mouth open. And, for the record, <i>reprove</i> is not the root word <i>prove</i> with the prefix <i>re-</i> as if to mean “prove again.” If you use it that way, someone would likely reprove you.</p></div></div>`;
