Feedback is almost always offered or requested with the intention of improving the final product. Another meaning of <i>feedback</i> is a kind of sound distortion from an amplifier or microphone. This sense of electronic feedback has been around since about 1920, while the "critical response" definition didn't come into use until 1955.</p></div>`;
