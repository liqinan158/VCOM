When guests on a TV talk show start yelling at each other, you can describe it as <i>confrontational</i>.</p><p class="long">When one person <i>confronts</i> another, they argue face-to-face — this interaction is confrontational. The Medieval Latin source of these words is <i>confrontare</i>, which simply means "adjoin," or "be next to," from the Latin roots <i>com-</i>, "together," and <i>frontem</i>, "forehead." So you could think of a confrontational situation as one in which two people are disagreeing while so close that their foreheads nearly touch.</p></div>`;
