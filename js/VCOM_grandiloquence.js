It’s too grand to be eloquent, so <i>grandiloquence</i> is usually annoying.</p><p class="long"><i>Grandiloquence</i> comes from the Latin word <i>grandis</i> for, yes, “grand” and <i>loqui</i> for “speak.”<i>Grandiloquence</i> is also related to <i>loquacious</i> (talkative), <i>soliloquy</i> (a solo speech), and other words about talk. Grandiloquence is a type of talk that is pompous and bombastic, full of pretty-sounding words and elegant turns of phrase that add up to nothing. Politicians who say nothing but make it sound important are masters of grandiloquence.</p></div></div>`;
