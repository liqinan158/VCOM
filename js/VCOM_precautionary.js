If you're babysitting your neighbor's three year old triplets, you might want to hide every fragile thing in your house as a <i>precautionary</i> measure first.</p><p class="long">If you do it beforehand to protect someone or something, it's precautionary. You may be sure you don't have a concussion after wiping out on your bike, but getting checked out at the emergency room would be a smart, precautionary move anyway. Putting on your helmet before you raced your bike down that hill was also precautionary. The Late Latin source of <i>precautionary</i> is <i>praecautionem</i>, "a safeguarding," from the Latin <i>praecavere</i>, "to guard against beforehand."</p></div>`;
