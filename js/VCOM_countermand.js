var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">countermand</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When an officer in the military shouts, “Belay that order, Private!” that is a <i>countermand</i>. A <i>countermand</i> is an order that cancels or reverses an earlier command. <i>Countermand</i> is also used as a verb meaning “to cancel or revoke.”</p><p class="long"><i>Counter</i> means “opposing” or “opposite,” and <i>mand</i> is short for “mandate” or “command.” Put them together and you’ve got <i>countermand</i> — an “opposing command.” When you issue a countermand, you cancel the original command and usually replace it with a new one. <i>Countermand</i> is often used in a military context, but it can be applied more widely. If your parents tell you to take out the trash, you might countermand these orders by telling your little brother to do it instead.</p></div>`;
