If you consider women more <i>emotive</i> than men, you think that women are more comfortable sharing their feelings than men.</p><p class="long">While the word <i>emotive</i> is similar to the word <i>emotional</i>, it's important to note that the two aren't interchangeable. Emotive is used with regard to something that makes you have intense feelings rather than just having intense feelings. For example, an emotive conversation will result in getting people's emotions riled up, while an emotional conversation is one in which people go into it with a lot of intense feelings already.</p></div></div>`;
