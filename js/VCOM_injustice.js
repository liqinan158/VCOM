The word comes from a Latin phrase that literally means “not right,” and <i>injustice</i> is the opposite of <i>justice</i>, which is a fair and righteous act.  Injustice can be general or specific, like the injustice suffered by poor people everywhere, or an individual act of injustice committed by some unkind person.</p></div>`;
