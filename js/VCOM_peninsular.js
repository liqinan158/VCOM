A peninsula is a piece of land that juts out into the water, nearly an island. Something that's peninsular looks like a peninsula or is a geographical area with a lot of peninsulas. The coast of Maine, for example, is peninsular, lined with thin necks of land. The Latin root, <i>p√¶ninsula</i>, literally means "almost an island."</p></div>`;
