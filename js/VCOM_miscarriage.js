In other words, a <i>miscarriage</i> is the abrupt, early end of a pregnancy.</p><p class="long">The medical sense of <i>miscarriage</i>, which usually describes the very early loss of a pregnancy (later losses are often called <i>stillbirths</i>), is actually among the newer uses of the word. In the sixteenth century, a miscarriage was almost always a "mistake or error" or sometimes "misbehavior." Today, when something doesn't go the way it was supposed to, you might call it a miscarriage.</p></div>`;
