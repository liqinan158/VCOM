If you are asked to <i>emend</i> a report, that just means you need to go through it and make revisions.</p><p class="long"><i>Emend</i> is similar in spelling and pronunciation to another word, <i>amend</i>, and there’s a slight overlap in meaning as well. <i>Emend</i> refers to changes and improvements made to a text. <i>Amend</i> also can refer to making minor changes to a text, but it can be used to describe improvements made to other things as well — for example, you can amend a situation. In contrast, <i>emend</i>’s powers are limited to words. So if you’re using <i>emend</i> — the one with the "e" — just make sure you’re describing improvements that involve text.</p></div>`;
