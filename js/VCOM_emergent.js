The Internet, for example, was an <i>emergent</i> technology in the early 1990s. <i>Emergent</i> sometimes implies that what is coming into being is surprising and demands a response. An “<i>emergent</i> disease,” for instance, would send scientists scrambling to find a cure. In this sense <i>emergent</i> is related to <i>emergency</i>.</p></div></div>`;
