As digital forms of photographs and music become more popular, <i>albums</i> are becoming a thing of the past.</p><p class="long">A photo album is full of pictures, and a stamp collector's album contains stamps from different countries. Another kind of album is a collection of songs, either on a record or a CD. In Latin, <i>album</i> means "white," and in ancient times it referred to a blank tablet. 16th century German academics kept what they called an <i>album amicorum</i>, or a collection of colleagues' signatures, and from there <i>album</i> came to mean "souvenir book."</p></div>`;
