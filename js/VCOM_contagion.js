This phenomenon can be described as a <i>contagion</i>, the spreading of an emotional or mental state (in this case, fatigue).</p><p class="long"><i>Contagion</i> can apply not only to the spread of emotions but also to the spread of disease. If you’re feeling sick, you should stay home to reduce the risk of contagion. (Be sure to use the word <i>contagion</i> when you call in sick; it’s a great opportunity to impress people with your vocabulary.) <i>Contagion</i> is akin to the word <i>contagious</i>, an adjective describing things that spread from person to person, like certain diseases... and yawning.</p></div></div>`;
