Or pass by a street lamp at night, and it turns on at that moment, seemingly just for you? That's <i>synchronicity,</i> when things happen together, as if perfectly timed.</p><p class="long">If you're planning to lip-sync your next concert, you'll want to work on your synchronicity with your soundman. And speaking of music, if you're a rock-and-roll nerd, you're no doubt thinking of "Synchronicity," the megahit album by The Police, released in 1983. The term <i>synchronicity</i> was coined in the 1950s by the Swiss psychologist Carl Jung, to describe uncanny coincidences that seem to be meaningful. The Greek roots are <i>syn-,</i> "together," and <i>khronos,</i> "time."</p></div>`;
