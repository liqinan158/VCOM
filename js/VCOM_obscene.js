It's never a good idea to use <i>obscene</i> language at school.</p><p class="long">Certain films, books, magazines, and other forms of entertainment are considered <i>obscene</i> because they portray sex in a very frank way that some people find vulgar and lewd. Obscene material, language, and jokes are considered taboo in polite society. <i>Obscene</i> can also be used to describe something repulsive â€” like when your friend ate an obscene number of snails at the Bastille Day bash.</p></div>`;
