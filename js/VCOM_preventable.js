Head injuries are mostly preventable too, if you wear a helmet when you ride your bike. Unless you're completely lost in your math class, bad grades on quizzes are preventable too; you just need to do your homework and study. When you prevent something, you keep it from happening. The Latin root is <i>praevenire</i>, "come before, anticipate, or hinder."</p></div>`;
