You can hold an orange in your palm or rest your palm on your friend's feverish forehead. <i>Palm</i> can also be a verb, meaning "steal" or "hide inside your hand." So a magician might palm a coin in her palm, and a shoplifter might palm a diamond ring in a jewelry store. Palm trees are named for their leaves' similarity to the fingers of a large hand.</p></div></div>`;
