var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">mayor</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The <i>mayor</i> is the leader of a city. He or she heads the city government. Just as a president leads a country, a <i>mayor</i> leads a city. Like other politicians, <i>mayors</i> must run for office and win an election.</p><p class="long">The word <i>mayor</i> comes from the Old French <i>maire</i> for "head of a city or town government" but most mayors probably like the original meaning, which is "greater, superior." Alas, mayors do run cities but calling them all superior is a stretch! In the United States, the president leads the country, a governor leads a state, and a mayor leads a city. If it’s used as a title for a particular mayor, as in Mayor Smith, it’s capitalized.</p></div>`;
