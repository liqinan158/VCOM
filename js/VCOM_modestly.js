After her play's successful opening night, a playwright might choose to sit <i>modestly</i> in the audience rather than going on stage to bow.</p><p class="long">When you act in an unpretentious way, you act modestly, and when you do something in the simplest way possible, you also do it modestly. The adjective <i>modest</i> can mean both "humble" and "small." <i>Modesty</i> and <i>modest</i> come from the Latin <i>modestia</i>, "sense of honor," or "correctness of conduct," from the root word <i>modus</i>, "measure or manner."</p></div>`;
