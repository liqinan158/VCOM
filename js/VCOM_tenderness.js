It's the quality of a person who cries when they see someone get hurt or who gently picks up a tiny kitten.</p><p class="long">Writing a heartfelt note to a sad friend is one way to show tenderness, and so is giving your brother a sincere hug on his birthday. Another definition of this adjective is "extreme sensitivity to pain." You might experience tenderness in your muscles the day after going on a long hike. This is actually the original meaning, from <i>tender</i>, "soft or easily injured," and a root meaning "stretched, thin, or weak."</p></div></div>`;
