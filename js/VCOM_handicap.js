Sometimes fate imposes a handicap, as when bad weather handicaps your travel plans, or a strike handicaps the subway system. <i>Handicap</i> comes from the term <i>hand in cap,</i> an ancient British practice in which two bettors placed their money into a hat held by a neutral third party before a bet.</p></div>`;
