It sounds like outer space, but actually large commercial airplanes often fly at altitudes that reach the stratosphere. People also use the word <i>stratosphere</i> in a figurative way to mean "really high," as when a car salesman brags, "Our sales this month have skyrocketed into the <i>stratosphere</i>!"</p></div></div>`;
