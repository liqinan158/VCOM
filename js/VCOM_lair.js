If you ever find yourself in a forest and face to face with a bear trying to lure you into his <i>lair</i>, beware! He may be plotting to eat you.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>lair</i> has its roots in the Old English <i>leger</i>, meaning “bed, couch, place of lying down.” It eventually became an “animal’s den” in the early 15th century. A person can have a lair, too, like the photo-covered basement of a serial killer, or a less scary person might have a cozy lair lined with plush carpet. Always poke a stick into a lair before going in, because you never know what sort of beast is lurking inside.</p></div>`;
