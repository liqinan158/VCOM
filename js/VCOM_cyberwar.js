Waging <i>cyberwar</i> on a foreign power might involve hacking its computer networks.</p><p class="long">The term <i>cyberwar</i> is slightly different from other kinds of <i>cybercrime</i>, in that it refers specifically to politically motivated attacks on a state or government â€” or occasionally, on another organization. Today's spies might commit espionage, a form of cyberwar, by hacking into networks to obtain state secrets. The word <i>cyberwar</i> itself uses the technological prefix <i>cyber-</i>, combined with <i>war</i>, from the Old English root <i>wyrre</i>, or "military conflict."</p></div></div>`;
