It's an old fashioned word, dating back to the fourteenth century, when it meant "conflict or trouble." "At do" was a Norse version of the English phrase "to do," which was eventually shortened to <i>ado</i>. The most famous use of the word is probably in the title of Shakespeare's <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i>.</p></div></div>`;
