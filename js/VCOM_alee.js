If a sailor moves the sail <i>alee</i>, she moves it downwind.</p><p class="long"><i>Alee</i> is a nautical term, one you're most likely to hear on a boat or ship. Another way to say "on the downwind side" is <i>leeward</i>. Both words include <i>lee</i>, from the Old English <i>hleo</i>, "shelter, cover, defense, or protection." So the <i>alee</i> side of a sailboat is the side that's sheltered from the wind, and the phrase "Hard <i>alee</i>!" is a command to move the sail to the boat's protected side.</p></div>`;
