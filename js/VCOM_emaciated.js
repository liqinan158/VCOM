It's probably how you'd start to look after a few weeks in the wilderness with only berries and bugs for dinner.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>emaciated</i> evolved from the Latin <i>emaciatus</i>, meaning to “make lean, waste away.” An <i>emaciated</i> person or animal isn't just thin. They're bony, gaunt, and most likely undernourished, often from illness. So if an emaciated stray cat shows up on your doorstep, give it a bowl of milk and maybe pay a visit to the vet.</p></div>`;
