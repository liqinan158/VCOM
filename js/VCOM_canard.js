This is a false, deluding statement designed to confuse the voters, as it presents the other candidate in a bad light by spreading an untruth.</p><p class="long">The Old French word <i>quanart</i>, "duck," morphed into <i>canard</i>, as in "vendre un canard à moitié," which refers to "half-selling" a duck, or cheating someone, and the word came to mean something meant to fool someone deliberately. Poet James Whitcomb Riley said, "When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck." Not always the case with <i>canard</i>.</p></div>`;
