Your family might rent a <i>cottage</i> near the beach every summer.</p><p class="long">In the US, a cottage typically has only one story, while in Canada a house can be much larger and still be called a <i>cottage</i>. In the Middle Ages, a cottage was housing for farm workers — sometimes known as <i>cottagers</i> — and the word implied not just a home, but also a barn and land. The first US holiday cottages were built in the 1880s in Bar Harbor, Maine and are credited with introducing the word <i>cottage</i> to North America.</p></div>`;
