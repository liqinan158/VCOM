First you tie on a pair of Hi-Jumps (your independent variable) and see how high you jump (your dependent variable). Then you try a pair of Bouncy-Man hi-tops (independent variable) and again measure how high you jump (the dependent variable). The changing values of the dependent variable — how high you jump — presumably depend on the independent variable, the different brands of shoes.</p></div>`;
