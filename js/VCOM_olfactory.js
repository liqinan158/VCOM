The odor from that factory is a symphony of <i>olfactory</i> delights. Not.</p><p class="long">Though we typically think of dogs as the olfactory champions of the world, what with their remarkable ability to sniff out practically anything, the true title belongs to the polar bear. Healthy, adult polar bears possess <i>olfactory</i> gifts that boggle the mind: they can smell a seal under the ice from over a kilometer away. One way to try to remember the meaning of the word <i>olfactory</i> is to think of <i>factory</i>. Your nose is the "factory" where odors are processed. What <i>visual</i> is to the eyes, <i>olfactory</i> is to the nose.</p></div></div>`;
