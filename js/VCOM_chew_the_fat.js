The expression may be related to "chew the cud," which means to talk aimlessly, ruminating over the same subject in a casual way, like a cow chewing its cud. It also seems that <i>chew the fat</i> evolved from an original nineteenth century British meaning, "to grumble, grouse, or complain."</p></div>`;
