Your brain has two <i>hippocampi</i>, and they're important for memories and emotions.</p><p class="long">This word has a complex history. Originally, it meant a seahorse, and it has also meant a small fish that resembles a seahorse. That resemblance is why the brain structures known as the hippocampus major and hippocampus minor have that name: they look kind of like seahorses too. The hippocampi are found on the floor of your brain's ventricles, and they are vital to feeling and remembering. Without your hippocampi, you wouldn't be who you are.</p></div>`;
