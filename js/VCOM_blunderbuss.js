The <i>blunderbuss</i> was one of the most widely-used weapons from the 17th to the 19th centuries.</p><p class="long">A shorter, handgun-style blunderbuss was called a "dragon." Both this and the shotgun type blunderbuss were loaded with lead balls, or "shot," and used in military operations and even taken along on the early 1800s Lewis and Clark expedition. <i>Blunderbuss</i> comes from the Dutch roots <i>donder</i>, "thunder," and <i>bus</i>, "gun." Another kind of <i>blunderbuss</i> is a bumbling, unsubtle, or oafish action: "The blunderbuss police operation did nothing but infuriate the protesters."</p></div></div>`;
