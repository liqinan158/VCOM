If you have a slice of pizza that's as long as the length of its crust, the angle created by the pointy end of the pizza slice is a radian.</p><p class="long">Imagine taking the radius of a circle — the line going from the center to the perimeter — and wrapping it around the outside. The angle this creates is a radian. You'll need to understand radians to study advanced math like trigonometry or calculus. The concept of a radian as a unit of measure was developed in 1714, but the word wasn't coined until the nineteenth century, from <i>radius</i>.</p></div></div>`;
