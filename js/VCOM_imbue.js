One visit to a sick relative in a hospital might be enough to <i>imbue</i> a child with a lifelong ambition to become a doctor.</p><p class="long">You can use <i>imbue</i> in a similar way as "saturate," or "soak through," to describe a filling or absorbing. A "hue" is a color, and it rhymes with <i>imbue.</i> When you're imbued with something, you are, in a way, colored by it. If you imbue a dish sponge with oily orange water from a spaghetti bowl, the color and the oil soak in. To fill people with qualities or emotions is, for example, to imbue them with strength or optimism.</p></div></div>`;
