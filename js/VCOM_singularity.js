You might note the <i>singularity</i> of a Hollywood movie that features a female lead role and no romance, for example.</p><p class="long">You can use the noun <i>singularity</i> when something is literally "one of a kind," like your grandmother's strange macrame wall art, or to mean exceptional or striking, like your nephew's bright red hair. He stands out among the other kindergartners, so his hair has a singularity, though he's not the only red-headed kid in the world. The Latin root is <i>singularis</i>, which means "single or solitary."</p></div>`;
