If your parents are constantly monitoring what you do, you may feel like they're <i>omnipresent</i> — and look forward to going to college somewhere far, far away.</p><p class="long">You might recognize the prefix <i>omni-</i>, meaning "all," from words like <i>omnipotent</i> ("all-powerful") or <i>omniscient</i> ("all-knowing"). Add it to <i>present</i>, and voilà, you have a word for something that's present all the time. You can't hide from an omnipresent being, and you can't escape an omnipresent smell. Language purists might prefer that a bad smell be described as <i>ubiquitous</i> ("turning up everywhere") and save the word <i>omnipresent</i> for the divine.</p></div>`;
