The word is short for "<i>danish</i> pastry," which is actually called <i>wienerbrød</i>, or "Viennese bread" in Denmark. The popular history of the danish involves a strike by Danish bakery workers which led bakeries to hire Austrian bakers, who brought their own recipes for pastries rich with butter and egg.</p></div></div>`;
