If you fight with your parents every year over whether they really must invite your annoying cousins for Thanksgiving, you could call that a <i>perennial</i> conflict.</p><p class="long">Arguing with your roommate about who cleaned the bathroom last time might be a perennial argument. There is also a <i>perennial</i> plant, which lasts more than two years and usually reappears each spring, because it produces flowers and seeds from the same root structure. <i>Perennial</i> comes from the Latin <i>perennis</i>, from the prefix <i>per-</i>, "through," plus <i>annus</i>, or "year." <i>Annus</i> is also the source of our English word <i>annual</i> â€” an <i>annual</i> plant lives only one year or season.</p></div></div>`;
