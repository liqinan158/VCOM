The Ubermensch was meant to be an ideal future human and an ultimate goal for humanity. When the concept was translated into English, it was first called "Beyond-Man" and later "Superman." In fact, the familiar comic book hero Superman (who was originally a villain) was directly inspired by Nietzsche's Ubermensch.</p></div>`;
