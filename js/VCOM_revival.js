If a news story mentions a <i>revival</i> in the technology industry, that means the industry, having gone through a slump, is once again thriving.</p><p class="long"><i>Revival</i> literally means "come back to life." An ER doctor might perform a revival of someone whose heart has stopped. We usually use it to mean "returned to glory, importance, or strength." Fresh paint and new flowerbeds might mean your neighborhood is experiencing a revival. If you don't like spiky hair, you may cringe at the revival of the mohawk in fashion magazines. <i>Revival</i> has a religious sense too, referring to a meeting that reawakens religious excitement and passion.</p></div></div>`;
