You might need to abrade your fingers with a nail brush to get them clean after working on your oily car engine all afternoon. The word <i>abrade</i> is related to <i>abrasion</i> — a scrape on the skin — and both words come from the Latin root <i>abradere</i>, which means "to scrape off."</p></div></div>`;
