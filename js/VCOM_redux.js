You will find this unusual adjective after the noun it describes, like when you talk about a friend's style being 1980s <i>redux</i> or a recent novel seeming like Henry James <i>redux</i>. It sounds like <i>reduce</i>, to make smaller, but its meaning is basically the same as <i>re-do</i>.</p></div></div>`;
