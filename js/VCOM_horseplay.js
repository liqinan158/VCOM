If you and your friends are jokingly pushing each other into a swimming pool, it's <i>horseplay</i>.</p><p class="long">Horseplay is vaguely dangerous â€” someone could get hurt, and that's why you might hear a teacher, babysitter, or parent yelling, "Hey, kids! Knock off the <i>horseplay</i>!" The origin of this word is a bit vague, although it's known to date from the 1500s, probably from the sense of a <i>horse</i> as a heavy, strong, rough animal.</p></div></div>`;
