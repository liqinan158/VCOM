Their fame gave rise to the now disused term <i>Siamese twins</i>, which has been replaced by <i>conjoined twins</i>. The somewhat infrequent verb <i>conjoin</i> — which provides the inspiration for the adjective <i>conjoined</i> — means to come together with a common purpose. You could say two people who share the same beliefs have conjoined minds.</p></div></div>`;
