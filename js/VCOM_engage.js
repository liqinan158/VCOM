If your sink is stopped up, <i>engage</i>, or hire, a plumber to fix it. Otherwise the smell of rotten food in the garbage disposal will <i>engage</i> your attention (in a bad way).</p><p class="long"><i>Engage</i> comes from a French word for pledge. If you agree to marry your sweetheart, you are <i>engaged</i> to marry. If you engage the kid next door to water your plants, she will expect to be paid for it. <i>Engagement</i> is also used to talk about war or conflict. An army engages its enemy in battle, just as you might engage in debate with a traffic cop over whether the light was yellow or red.</p></div>`;
