The only <i>downside</i> you can see to getting a puppy is having to leave it when you go to school — although your parents may see more <i>downsides</i> than that.</p><p class="long">When the word <i>downside</i> was coined in the 1680s, it meant "underside" or "underneath." It wasn't until the late 20th century that this word came to mean "negative aspect of something otherwise seen as good." Today, the downside of a puppy isn't its fuzzy belly — it's the hours of training, late-night walks, money spent at the vet, and chewed-up shoes.</p></div></div>`;
