When you put out a campfire, it's important to make sure that not one single <i>cinder</i> remains.</p><p class="long">It's easy to miss the fact that a cinder is still hot, since it remains that way long after every flame has been extinguished. When people clean out their wood stoves, they put the ashes in a metal bucket — rather than a flammable paper bag, for example — in case there are hot cinders hidden inside them. The word <i>cinder</i> comes from the Old English <i>sinder</i>, or "slag." The <i>c</i> comes from the otherwise unrelated French <i>cendre</i>, "ashes."</p></div>`;
