Not only is your poop watery, but you might have to go often and urgently â€” you probably know that feeling of running to the nearest toilet, praying you'll make it in time. Diarrhea is a symptom of the flu and other medical problems, but just eating food you're not used to can cause it. If someone can't stop talking, people sometimes use the slang expression <i>diarrhea of the mouth</i>.</p></div>`;
