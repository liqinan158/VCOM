One five-sided place, the Pentagon in the U.S., is actually a center of government activity. A recreation center is a place where a lot of recreation happens, just as a medical center is where a lot of doctors and nurses give medical treatment. These centers are buildings or complexes where a certain kind of activity takes place, and a word before <i>center</i> often tells you what the activity is. As a verb, you can <i>center</i> your attention on something or <i>center</i> a centerpiece in the middle of a table.</p></div></div>`;
