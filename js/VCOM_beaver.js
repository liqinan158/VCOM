Their long teeth make it possible for them to chew through even broad tree trunks, felling them across bodies of water to create dams. This provides the beavers with a safe home or lodge, protected by the ponds they've created and usually accessible only underwater. The word <i>beaver</i> has a Proto-Indo-European root that means "brown" or "bright."</p></div></div>`;
