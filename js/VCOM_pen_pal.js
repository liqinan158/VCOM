Even though you've never met him, your <i>pen pal</i> may live in France and send you poems by Rimbaud.</p><p class="long">Most pen pals get to know each other through the letters they exchange, and many of them live in different countries. Having a pen pal whose life is very different from yours can be fun and educational â€” in fact, you might first get a pen pal's name and address at school. Traditionally, pen pals write letters, although it's possible to do this via email too. In the UK, the term <i>penfriend</i> is more common.</p></div>`;
