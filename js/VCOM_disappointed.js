If you write a fan letter to your favorite actress hoping for a personal reply, you're likely to be <i>disappointed</i>.</p><p class="long">The original French root of <i>disappointed</i> is <i>desappointer</i>, which has one meaning that's basically "to fail to keep an appointment." So you might imagine the word <i>disappointed</i> like this: you made an appointment with a friend, but he blew it off. What could leave you more disappointed than that?</p></div>`;
