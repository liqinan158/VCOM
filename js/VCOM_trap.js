If a critter is nibbling at your cherry tomato plants, set a <i>trap</i> to catch the thief. (But if it turns out to be your little brother, set him free!)</p><p class="long">If a TV character yells, "Look out! It's a trap!" they're dramatically warning someone about an imminent surprise attack or mean-spirited trick. Other kinds of traps include a plumbing trap, a curved pipe that traps liquid in it so that gases can't rise up into your sink, and a sand trap, the tricky hollow where your ball gets stuck on a golf course. The Germanic root word of <i>trap</i> literally means "that onto which one steps."</p></div></div>`;
