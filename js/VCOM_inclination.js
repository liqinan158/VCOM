Sometimes the <i>inclination</i> is literal; in most cases it's about what you <i>incline</i> toward in a figurative sense.</p><p class="long">An inclination is something you are leaning toward, a tendency you have. You could have a specific inclination for chocolate, or you could have an inclination that applies to a decision you are about to make: "Looking at this dessert menu, my <i>inclination</i> is to skip everything and just go home and have a chocolate bar."</p></div>`;
