The twentieth century saw the <i>conversion</i> from outhouses to indoor plumbing. You may oversee the <i>conversion</i> of your attic into an extra bedroom.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>conversion</i> can be used to describe some very specific transformations. If you exchange euros for dollars, you have made a monetary conversion. If your Canadian friend tells you, "It was warm today! It got up to 28!" and you figure out that 28 degrees in Celsius is the same as 82 degrees in Fahrenheit, then you have made a mathematical conversion. If you change your religion, you've had a religious conversion.</p></div></div>`;
