If you hear a <i>preternatural</i> dog's barking, maybe it sounds like a police siren instead of a howl.</p><p class="long">Note that <i>preternatural</i> contains the word <i>natural</i>. <i>Preter</i> comes from the Latin word <i>praeter</i> which means "beyond"; so something preternatural is beyond nature. It is less commonly used than <i>unnatural</i> or <i>supernatural</i> but means the same thing. If you lift a truck off the ground and hold it above your head, people will marvel at you and say you have preternatural strength.</p></div>`;
