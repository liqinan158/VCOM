While you wouldn't call asking for a hall pass a <i>plea</i>, you could make a <i>plea</i> for justice or world peace.</p><p class="long"><i>Plea</i> also has a legal meaning. When you get a traffic ticket or if you're accused of a crime, you have to enter a plea of "guilty" or "not guilty." A "<i>plea</i> bargain" is when you make a deal with the prosecutor â€” you may plead guilty to a charge (by entering a guilty plea) that has less of a penalty and, in return, the prosecutor drops the more serious charge.</p></div></div>`;
