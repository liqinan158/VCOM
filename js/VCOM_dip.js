You might <i>dip</i> your toe into a swimming pool to check the water temperature.</p><p class="long">When you finger paint, you dip a fingertip into a puddle of paint, and when you eat a snack you might dip tortilla chips into salsa. You can also say that a boat bobbing on the ocean dips, or that a bird dropping lower in the sky dips down. A <i>dip</i> can be a quick swim, a delicious sauce meant for dunking other foods in, or a downward slope. The Old English root, <i>dyppan</i>, means "immerse" or "baptize."</p></div></div>`;
