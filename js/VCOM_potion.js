This noun is related to the Latin verb, <i>potare</i>, which means, “to drink.” You might also notice its similarity to the adjective <i>potable</i>, another word for “drinkable.” Some common types you may read about or hear about are “sleeping potions,” “love potions,” and “magic potions.”</p></div></div>`;
