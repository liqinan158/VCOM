To say a fire consumed a building is to say that the entire building was destroyed. <i>Consume</i> means to devour, to take in, to use up. The Unites States is often referred to as a <i>consumer</i> society because our economy is based on things being consumed. Whether it's gas, clothes, burgers, music, or anything that we use up as we purchase it, it's something that we consume. If we consume all the oil, there will be none left to burn.</p></div></div>`;
