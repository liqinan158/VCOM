var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">hatchet job</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>hatchet job</i> is an unfair attack on someone, especially a written attack. A newspaper article disguised as a movie review might, on closer inspection, actually be a <i>hatchet job</i> on the film's director.</p><p class="long">If you misrepresent or malign someone, particularly in a public way, that's a hatchet job. Writing a gossipy tell-all memoir about your family and close friends might feel like a hatchet job to them if you reveal their secrets and exaggerate their flaws. The phrase <i>hatchet job</i> comes from the earlier <i>hatchet man</i>, 1880s California slang for "hired Chinese assassin," from an earlier military term for the solider in front who cleared the way for troops.</p></div>`;
