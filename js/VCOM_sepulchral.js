Something that's <i>sepulchral</i> reminds you of a sepulchre, either because it looks or feels like an actual tomb, or simply because it makes you think of death or dying. An empty building might be sepulchral, or a gloomy gathering. The Latin root word is <i>sepelire</i>, "to bury or embalm."</p></div></div>`;
