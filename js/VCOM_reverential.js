You might speak about your beloved kindergarten teacher in a <i>reverential</i> voice.</p><p class="long">To talk about someone in a reverential way or treat a family heirloom with reverential care is to act out of a deep, almost solemn kind of respect. The adjective <i>reverential</i> comes close to implying worship â€” a devoutly religious person feels reverential toward God, for example. It's rooted in the Latin word <i>reverentia</i>, "awe or respect," from <i>revereri</i>, "to stand in awe of, fear, or be afraid of."</p></div></div>`;
