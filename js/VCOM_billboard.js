You might pass several <i>billboards</i> on the highway advertising a car dealership, a restaurant, or anything else someone paid to have on a <i>billboard</i> big enough to be seen by passing cars.</p><p class="long">When a company decides how to advertise, it may buy Internet ads, TV commercials, newspaper spreads, or billboard advertisements. A billboard is a good way for a business to catch people's attention, because itâ€™s so big and a commuter may drive or walk past it five times a week. The word <i>billboard</i> first appeared in American English in the 1840s, meaning the board or wall where posters or handbills could be pasted. <i>Billboard</i> is also the name of a music magazine.</p></div>`;
