Similarly, someone who sticks to a cause no matter what has a really strong <i>adhesion</i> or commitment to that cause.</p><p class="long"><i>Adhesion</i> comes from the Latin <i>adhaesionem</i> meaning "a sticking to," a translation that perfectly captures that adhesive quality.  Objects can be characterized by their adhesion â€” like Scotch tape or Velcro. Similarly, when you see a group of protesters camped outside the Capital fighting for a cause, it's their adhesion (or dedication) that keeps them stuck there rain or shine. In medicine, adhesion is used to describe abnormal bands of scar tissue that might form after a surgery.</p></div>`;
