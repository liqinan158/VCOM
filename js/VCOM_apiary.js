If you love to eat fresh honey and don't have access to a farmer's market, you might consider building an <i>apiary</i> in your back yard.</p><p class="long">Apiaries have nothing to do with apes! Rather, the word derives from <i>apis</i>, the Latin word for bee. Nowadays, <i>apiary</i> is one of those farm-related words that is slipping out of our common vocabulary as we leave the culture of the small farm behind. But as chefs and slow food activists reintroduce locally farmed food back into our diets, <i>apiarists</i> will reemerge to raise honey from apiaries and sell it to us all. And maybe that will help us remember what that word actually means.</p></div></div>`;
