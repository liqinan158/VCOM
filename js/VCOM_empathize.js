If you get teary-eyed upon hearing about the death of your friend's pet hermit crab, you're probably <i>empathizing</i> with your friend â€” unless you're just bored to tears by her story.</p><p class="long"><i>Empathize</i> is often used interchangeably with <i>sympathize</i>, but you'll get no <i>empathy</i> (or sympathy) from usage experts if you confuse the two. When you sympathize with another person, you feel sad that she is suffering, but you don't necessarily relate to her experience. It's easiest to <i>empathize</i> when you've been through a similar experience; for example, if your pet guppy had recently passed away, your friend's hermit crab story would have broken your heart due to <i>empathy</i>.</p></div></div>`;
