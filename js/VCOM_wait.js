The <i>wait</i> to get the brand new computer was four hours long, but it was worth it.</p><p class="long">The word <i>wait</i> originated in the 1200s, from the Old Northern French word <i>waitier</i>: "to watch with hostile intent." Even back then, people didn't like to wait. Anticipating something that will happen is waiting, though sometimes what you wait for never comes â€” like Godot, who never shows up in the play "Waiting for Godot." When you wait to do something, you delay. When you wait tables, you serve people, preferably without delay.</p></div></div>`;
