var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">luxury</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>luxury</i> is something that is pleasant to have or experience, but it is not necessary. For example, eating in a restaurant is a <i>luxury</i> â€” you can always cook and eat at home.</p><p class="long">In its earliest days, <i>luxury</i> meant "excess that is sinfully self-indulgent." Over time, this definition softened, losing the air of judgment, but retaining the sense that a luxury is enjoyable or comfortable, but not necessary. We often think of a luxury as something costly, but this isn't always so. For example, being able to sleep late or live within walking distance of loved ones or a beautiful forest can also be luxuries.</p></div>`;
