In the 17th century, theorists called preformationists argued that a human being begins life as a tiny, preformed person — a <i>homunculus</i> — encapsulated in the sperm or, as some thought, in the egg.</p><p class="long">The preformationists were arguing against Aristotle's view that humans and other organisms begin life as unformed material that gradually takes shape, and, in the case of humans, this process includes a moment of "ensoulment" — when the embryo gets a soul and becomes fully human. A <i>homunculus</i> can also be a "little man" of any sort. You can describe your Ken doll as a <i>homunculus</i>. The word is the diminutive of the Latin word <i>homo</i> "man."</p></div>`;
