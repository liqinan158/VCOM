You may prefer to walk around barefoot unless it's really cold, in which case you wear <i>slippers</i>.</p><p class="long">Slippers are cozy, and they're often warm too. A more old fashioned kind of slipper was a dress shoe that slipped on the foot, rather than being buckled or buttonedâ€”like Cinderella's glass slipper. The word comes from the fact that you can <i>slip</i> a slipper on or off easily. It's related to the Old English <i>slypescoh</i>, literally "slip-shoe."</p></div>`;
