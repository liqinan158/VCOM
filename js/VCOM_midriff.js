This noun is sometimes used as a substitute for <i>belly</i> or <i>waist</i>, especially when someone is wearing clothes that deliberately expose this area. Your bikini reveals your midriff, but your winter coat covers your midriff. In Old English, the word was <i>midhrif</i>, from <i>hrif</i>, "belly."</p></div></div>`;
