What your parents think is cool is usually very <i>passé,</i> but sometimes their old stuff is stylish again, like the Lynyrd Skynyrd T-shirt you borrow from your mom.</p><p class="long">From the French <i>passer,</i> "to pass," <i>passé</i> came into English use in the 18th century, and its accented "é" is still used in the 21st century. Pronounced "pass-AY," the adjective <i>passé</i> is a classier way to call something outdated, unfashionable, and so out of touch with trends. Your floppy pop-star haircut may be passé if a crew-cut band becomes all the rage, but even saying "all the rage" is itself probably passé. If it's current and in style, it's not passé.</p></div></div>`;
