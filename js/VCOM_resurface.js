It also means to come back, like a problem you wanted to forget or a monster in a movie that wonâ€™t die.</p><p class="long">You can resurface a birthday cake with another layer of frosting if you discover your brother has stuck his finger in the original buttercream. Another way to resurface is to emerge or appear again, sometimes above an actual surface, like when a dolphin dives under water and then resurfaces several minutes later. The dream you forgot when you woke up might also (figuratively) resurface later in the day.</p></div></div>`;
