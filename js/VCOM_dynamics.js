If you're taking a physics class, you will likely study <i>dynamics.</i></p><p class="long"><i>Dynamics</i> has its origins in the Greek word <i>dynamis</i>, "force, power." In physics, dynamics is the study of bodies in motion and changes in that motion, and that idea can be applied to other areas as well. For example, we refer to "group dynamics" as the way people interact and work together. George W. Bush once observed, "Globalization has altered the dynamics in the White House, as well as between the White House and the Treasury."</p></div>`;
