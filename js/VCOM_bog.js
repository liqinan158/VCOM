A <i>bog</i> is a swampy kind of ground made up mostly of decomposing plants and mosses.</p><p class="long">Nothing can be built on a bog because the ground is so spongy and damp, and no crops can be grown there. The dried soil from a bog can, however, be dried and burned for fuel. A figurative <i>bog</i> is anything that you tend to get stuck in, like a bog of health problems. Things can also "bog you down", or slow you down literally or figuratively, like when your homework bogs you down so you can't enjoy the weekend.</p></div>`;
