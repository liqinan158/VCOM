You can also say it's <i>unlocked</i> or <i>unlatched</i>. An unbolted front door can be opened by turning the knob, and an unbolted bike lock is basically useless against bicycle thieves. <i>Unbolted</i> comes from <i>bolt</i>, which as a noun has meant "stout pin for fastening objects together" since the 15th century.</p></div>`;
