Whether it refers to changing something to suit someone's wishes or providing someone with something he needs, <i>accommodate</i> typically involves making something fit. You might change your lunch plans, for example, to accommodate your best friend's schedule. <i>Accommodate</i> can also refer to providing housing or having enough space for something. You might need to open up the extra bedroom to accommodate your out-of-town guests.</p></div></div>`;
