A kindergarten teacher might <i>consciously</i> choose a soothing book to calm his class down at story time.</p><p class="long">If you do something instinctively or automatically, you're not consciously choosing to do it â€” it's just happening. On the other hand, if you consciously invite only friends who get along with each other to your party, you've done it in a thoughtful, intentional way. The adverb <i>consciously</i> comes from <i>conscious</i>, "aware and awake," from the Latin <i>conscius</i>, "knowing or aware," which has a Greek root, <i>syneidos</i>, "to know."</p></div></div>`;
