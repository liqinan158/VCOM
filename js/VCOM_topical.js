This might be a news story or a bit of gossip, or just a subject that is of current importance. If it's "now," it's <i>topical</i>.</p><p class="long">There are several meanings of the word <i>topical</i>, but one clue can help you remember them all: that inside word "top." You often hear newscasters refer to the "top" stories of the day—they’re current, and that makes them topical. That same little word "top" can help you remember the medical meaning of <i>topical</i>: pertaining to the surface of the skin. A cream applied to the "top" of your skin is a topical medication. Remember that clue, and you'll be "tops" too.</p></div>`;
