var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">flagship</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Traditionally, the commander of a navy traveled in the <i>flagship</i>, which was distinguished by flying his distinctive flag. You can also call the ship in the front of a fleet the <i>flagship</i>.</p><p class="long">The flagship is generally the most powerful in some way — better armed, or larger, than the ships that follow it. Ultimately, the most important thing about a flagship is that it's first. Based on this meaning, another kind of <i>flagship</i> is something that's the first, best, or biggest example of something — a product, store, or program, for example. Starbucks' enormous flagship coffee shop, the company's largest and fanciest shop, is in Seattle, Washington.</p></div>`;
