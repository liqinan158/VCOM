When you shrug your <i>shoulders</i>, you lift them to convey indifference or the fact that you don't know the answer.</p><p class="long">Human shoulders are versatile ball-and-socket joints that are flexible but sturdy enough to allow for lifting heavy objects. Another kind of shoulder is the strip at the side of a road where you can pull your car over in an emergency. This word is also used as a verb, for literally or figuratively carrying heavy burdens: "You shoulder so much responsibility at work â€” they should give you a raise!" Give someone "the cold shoulder," and you're deliberately being unfriendly to them.</p></div></div>`;
