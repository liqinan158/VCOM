The kind of skiing that requires a mountain to race down is alpine skiing, and moss that grows at very high altitudes is alpine moss. In fact, if something has to do with tall mountains, it's <i>alpine</i>. The word means "of the Alps," and if <i>Alpine</i> is capitalized, it is referring specifically to the Alps.</p></div>`;
