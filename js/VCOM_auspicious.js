If you start a marathon by falling flat on your face, that's not an auspicious start.</p><p class="long">If something seems likely to bring success — either because it creates favorable conditions or you just consider it a lucky sign — label it <i>auspicious</i>. The word is related to <i>auspice</i>, "a divine omen," an old word with a colorful history. In Latin, an <i>auspex</i> was a person who observed the flight of birds to predict things about the future. Luckily, you no longer have to be a bird-watching fortune-teller to guess whether something is auspicious or not.</p></div>`;
