You can also use the adjective <i>abloom</i> figuratively, to mean "flourishing" or "healthy," as when your pink-cheeked friend looks abloom with good health from the fresh air. The prefix <i>a-</i> here means "in," and <i>bloom</i> has a Scandinavian root, the Old Norse <i>bl√≥m</i>, "flower or blossom."</p></div>`;
