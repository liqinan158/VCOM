Standing passengers on buses and subways are sometimes called <i>straphangers</i>, named for the habit of grabbing the leather or webbed straps that once commonly hung from above. Some modes of transportation still have these straps, though they've increasingly been replaced with poles and handles.</p></div></div>`;
