If someone compliments you on your outfit, but you notice them rolling their eyes when they think youâ€™re not looking, they probably weren't being <i>sincere</i>.</p><p class="long">If you've been offered a sincere thanks for something you've done, the person is probably really grateful. Sometimes when people say "thank you," they don't always mean it, but when they add the adjective <i>sincere,</i> the emphasis is usually for a very good reason. You may hear a charity sending out a sincere thanks to sponsors for their donations, which help keep the charity running.</p></div></div>`;
