It was once less common for houses to be built with closets, and armoires gave people a place to store things out of sight. <i>Armoire</i> is a French word, from the Old French <i>armarie</i>, "cupboard or bookcase," with its Latin root <i>armarium</i>, "closet for storing implements or tools."</p></div></div>`;
