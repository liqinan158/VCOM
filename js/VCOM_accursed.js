You might call your car <i>accursed</i> if it keeps mysteriously dying in the middle of the road for no apparent reason.</p><p class="long">An accursed house might be haunted by a spirit or under an evil spell, or you might describe it as accursed if unexplained things happen in it. You can also use the adjective simply to describe something you're angry about: "This <i>accursed</i> town! I can't wait to move to California!" In the 13th century, the word was <i>acursede</i>, "lying under a curse," from the now-obsolete <i>acursen</i>, "pronounce a curse upon."</p></div></div>`;
