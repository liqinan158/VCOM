In most cells, humans have 22 pairs of these <i>chromosomes</i>  plus the two sex <i>chromosomes</i> (XX in females and XY in males) for a total of 46.</p><p class="long">The word <i>chromosome</i> was originally coined in German from the Greek words <i>khroma</i>, meaning color, and <i>soma</i> meaning body. In the late 1800s, a scientist, Wilhelm von Waldeyer-Hartz, gave chromosomes their name because chromosomes easily accept dye and take on patterns of light and dark when exposed to different stains that help identify the different chromosomes.</p></div></div>`;
