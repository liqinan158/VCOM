If your gas stove ignites a towel and you can't put out the flames, call the <i>firefighters</i>!</p><p class="long">The word <i>fireman</i> is older than <i>firefighter</i>, which first appeared in the late 19th century, and for a long time it was much more commonly used. These days, it's more accurate to use <i>firefighter</i>, since men and women both work for fire departments battling fires. Also, the word perfectly describes the job itself, fighting dangerous fires.</p></div>`;
