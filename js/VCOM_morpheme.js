var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">morpheme</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">In linguistics, the smallest unit of language or grammar is called a <i>morpheme</i>. You can break words down into <i>morphemes</i> â€” like the <i>-s</i> at the end of a noun that tells you it's plural or the <i>-ly</i> at the end of a word that shows it's an adverb.</p><p class="long">While some words can be divided into two or more morphemes, others consist of a single morpheme. The word <i>dog</i>, for example, is considered a "free" morpheme, because it can stand alone. Prefixes and suffixes like <i>un-</i> and <i>-ing</i>, are "bound" morphemes, dependent for meaning on other morphemes. A linguist coined the word in 1895, modeling it after <i>phoneme</i>, "distinct unit of sound," and adding the Greek <i>morphe</i>, "form or shape."</p></div>`;
