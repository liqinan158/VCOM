If a bookstore's employees join together to purchase the store, there's an <i>inversion</i> of power: the employees become owners, and the former owners are their employees.</p><p class="long">Reversing the normal order of words in a sentence is also an <i>inversion</i>, especially if the verb comes before the subject. This inversion happens naturally in questions like "Are you happy?" but in statements it can sound a bit like Yoda from "Star Wars" â€” "Happy are you." In weather terms, an <i>inversion</i> occurs when the air temperature near the ground is colder than the upper air temperature.</p></div>`;
