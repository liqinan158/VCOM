Some English teachers are <i>grammarians</i> — they’re the ones who don’t mind spending an afternoon discussing the Oxford comma.</p><p class="long">In case you’re underwhelmed, know that the word <i>grammarian</i> comes from the Old French word  <i>gramairien</i> for "wise man, person who knows Latin, or magician." English-speaking grammarians don’t necessarily know Latin these days, but it wouldn’t hurt. Grammarians often write books on the parts of speech, diagramming sentences, or anything else about grammar and syntax. Wise? Yes. Magicians? Rarely.</p></div>`;
