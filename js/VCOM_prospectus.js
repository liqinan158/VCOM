The idea of a <i>prospectus</i> is to offer a variety of options and a plan of action.</p><p class="long">One goal of a prospectus is to present the positive features of something in order to attract a desired participant. When a new company wants to attract investors or a stock brokerage wants to attract new clients, each offers a prospectus specific to its goals. The word is from the Latin verb <i>specere</i>, "to look," which is combined with the prefix <i>prō-</i>, "forward" — giving us a verb meaning "to look forward" to something that is coming. The modern word appeared first in France in the 18th century.</p></div></div>`;
