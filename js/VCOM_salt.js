You might sprinkle <i>salt</i> on your hot buttered popcorn to make it even more delicious.</p><p class="long">Although many people eat too much salt, it's actually necessary for life, in both plants and animals. The scientific name for salt is <i>sodium chloride</i>, and it's been harvested from seawater and salt mines for most of human history. When you use <i>salt</i> as a verb, it means "shake salt onto." If someone's known as an <i>old salt</i>, it means they're an experienced sailor â€” and if they're the <i>salt of the earth</i>, they're honest and reliable.</p></div></div>`;
