The ancient Romans were particularly famous for their <i>aqueducts</i> and some still stand today.</p><p class="long">The Romans didn't invent aqueducts, but they did help spawn the English word for one. <i>Aqueduct</i> comes from the Latin word <i>aqu√¶ductus</i>, which itself is from the roots <i>aqua</i>, meaning water, and <i>ducere</i>, meaning "to lead." Because of the root word <i>aqua</i>, there is a tendency to try to spell <i>aqueduct</i> with an <i>A</i> in place of the <i>E</i>, but now you'll know better.</p></div>`;
