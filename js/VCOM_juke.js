Another word for a <i>juke</i> is a "roadhouse."</p><p class="long">If you visit a rowdy rural bar with dancing and beer, you can call it a <i>juke</i>. Many country and blues bands got their start playing at jukes in the south, although some jukes offer jukeboxes as their only music. You can also call it a "<i>juke</i> joint." The word <i>juke</i> comes from the Southern United States Creole known as Gullah â€” in which <i>juke</i> or <i>joog</i> means "wicked" or "disorderly."</p></div>`;
