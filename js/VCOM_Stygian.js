var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">Stygian</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Something that's <i>Stygian</i> is dark, murky, and probably a little melancholy. Your walk home from the bus stop might feel <i>Stygian</i> on a foggy, moonless night.</p><p class="long">When you describe something as <i>Stygian</i>, you're comparing it to the murky and terrible river Styx, which flows through the underworld in ancient Greek mythology. The word itself comes from the Greek word <i>Stygios</i>, from <i>Styx</i>, which literally means "the hateful." Some related words in Greek are <i>stygos</i>, "hatred," and <i>stygnos</i>, "gloomy." That should give you a good idea of the way a Stygian library, alley, or cave looks and feels â€” dismal and dark.</p></div>`;
