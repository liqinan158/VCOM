For example, there is no more <i>definite</i> way to get into trouble with a police officer than speeding in front of the police station with a broken taillight.</p><p class="long">This word is from the Latin <i>definitus</i> meaning "defined" or "limited." <i>Definite</i> can also be used to mean something is very clearly planned or certainly defined. If you have definite plans for the evening to go to the theater and out for a nice dinner at a steak house, you're probably not going to end up playing miniature golf and eating fast food instead.</p></div>`;
