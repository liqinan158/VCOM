When a school has a <i>zero tolerance</i> policy for tardiness, it means that students are punished the first time they're late to school.</p><p class="long">It's most common to use the phrase <i>zero tolerance</i> when you're talking about punishment of some kind. If a city announces that there will be zero tolerance for littering, it means that you will get a ticket if you're caught throwing your burrito wrapper on the ground. It's <i>zero tolerance</i> because a law breaker gets zero warnings or chances before facing some punishment â€” in other words, the law's enforcer won't tolerate any law breaking, no matter how slight.</p></div>`;
