But in America, it's a way of life. A bunch of people with similar beliefs might all decide to get a big house and live <i>communally</i>, sharing the cooking, bills, and everything else. You can also commune with something, like nature: that means to be in tune with nature and very receptive to it. To <i>commune</i> can also mean to receive the Catholic communion.</p></div>`;
