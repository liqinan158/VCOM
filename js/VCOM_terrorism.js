What distinguishes terrorism from assault or murder is that terrorism is intended to intimidate and create mayhem, to inspire terror. It's terrorism when a suicide bomber blows himself up in a crowded bus, in that the violence is directed not against soldiers on a battlefield but against civilians going about their everyday lives.</p></div></div>`;
