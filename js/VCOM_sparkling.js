Another way to use the adjective <i>sparkling</i> is to describe a carbonated beverage, like sparkling wine or sparkling cider. Any fizzy, bubbly drink is sparkling. People have used <i>sparkling</i> to describe wine and eyes since the fifteenth century, and it comes from the Old English <i>spearca</i>, "glowing or fiery particle thrown off."</p></div></div>`;
