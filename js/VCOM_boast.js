Along those lines, English poet Sir Thomas Overbury, who died in 1613, once said, "The man who has nothing to <i>boast</i> of but his illustrious ancestry is like the potato â€” the best part underground." However, the word can also be used in a positive way: a town can boast a new library, or a school can boast a high graduation rate.</p></div></div>`;
