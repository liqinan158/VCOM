When you obey someone's rules, you follow them strictly. The verb <i>disobey</i> combines the Latin <i>obedire</i>, "serve, pay attention to, or listen," with <i>dis</i>, which here means "not." The original Latin version of <i>disobey</i>, <i>inobedire</i>, used <i>in</i> rather than <i>dis</i>.</p></div>`;
