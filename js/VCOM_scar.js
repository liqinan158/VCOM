It's all that and more. <i>Scar</i> can be a noun or a verb â€” you can have a scar on your knee after your skateboarding incident, and a bad round of chicken pox can scar you. Something scary can scar, you, too, like a horror movie or catching your parents in the act. Scars can be emotional. Take one letter off <i>scare</i> and you're left with a <i>scar</i>.</p></div></div>`;
