You can put up with someone (have patience) or put them down (insult them). You can put a spin on an idea — and then put it to work. When life’s unfair you feel put upon.  If there's a fire in your kitchen, you should put it out. If you order take-out, you might call ahead to put in your order. If you’re hungry, you’ll put away a lot of food.</p></div>`;
