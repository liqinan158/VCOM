If you borrow money to buy a car, you'll be expected to make a monthly <i>payment</i> for several years.</p><p class="long">Your paycheck itself is a payment, and so is the act of your boss handing you that paycheck. There are also types of payment that don't involve money, like when your payment for watching your little cousin one afternoon consists of a big piece of your uncle's famous apple pie. <i>Payment</i>, from the verb <i>pay</i>, is rooted in the Latin <i>pacare</i>, used to mean "satisfy a creditor," but originally defined as "please, satisfy, or make peaceful."</p></div>`;
