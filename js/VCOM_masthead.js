You'll usually find the <i>masthead</i> on one of the first few pages.</p><p class="long">In the UK, a <i>masthead</i> is slightly different: it's the title page, also known in the US as the "nameplate." American publications include editorial and ownership information on the masthead, while their British counterparts call this the "imprint." The sense of a masthead as the "top of a newspaper or magazine" comes from the word's original meaning, "top of a ship," from <i>mast</i>, "long pole that holds a ship's sail."</p></div>`;
