Your family may want to make a lot of <i>hoopla</i> on your birthday, while you'd prefer a quiet dinner at home.</p><p class="long"><i>Hoopla</i> is when someone goes overboard getting excited about something. A company may raise a lot of hoopla about a new product that's actually kind of boring, and a teacher's hoopla about the class Halloween party might seem silly if she teaches twelfth grade physics rather than kindergarten. The word <i>hoopla</i> has been around since at least the 1800's, although it was originally spelled <i>houp-la</i>, and it was first used as an exclamation similar to <i>oopsie daisy</i>.</p></div>`;
