People getting married often <i>vow</i> to stick together “till death do us part,” while a presidential candidate might <i>vow</i> to lower taxes.</p><p class="long">You can use <i>vow</i> as both a noun and a verb: A <i>vow</i> is a solemn declaration; to <i>vow</i> is the act of making that promise. Vows are meant to be serious, sacred things, even vows made with the best intentions can be broken. Wrote American short-story writer and poet Dorothy Parker, “By the time you swear you are his, shivering and sighing, And he <i>vows</i> his passion is infinite and undying—Lady, make a note of this: One of you is lying.”</p></div>`;
