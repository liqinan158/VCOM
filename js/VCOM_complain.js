You might <i>complain</i> to your landlord about a raise in your rent, or to the cops about your noisy neighbors. Just don't whine; it won't get you anywhere.</p><p class="long">Speakers of Yiddish will know that <i>complain</i> is often interchangeable with <i>kvetch</i>, which is what you do when you don't like the food or the small portions. But you can complain in a more formal way by, say, writing a letter or even filing a lawsuit. But whether the issue is large or small, do yourself a favor and don't complain too often, or people might stop taking you seriously.</p></div>`;
