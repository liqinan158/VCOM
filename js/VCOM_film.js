The movie itself is a film, and you can also use the word to mean the photographic strip of plastic that runs through a camera and captures the film's images. It's also a verb, meaning to use such a camera: "Let's <i>film</i> a scene where you play with my cat!" The Old English root word is <i>filmen</i>, "membrane or thin skin."</p></div></div>`;
