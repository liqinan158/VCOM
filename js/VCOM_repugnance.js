If you love animals, you probably feel <i>repugnance</i> for people who mistreat their horses.</p><p class="long">The word <i>repugnance</i> comes from Latin root words, <i>re</i>, meaning back, and <i>pugnare</i>,  to fight. When we use repugnance, we don't just mean the feeling of fighting back or resisting, but also a feeling of horror or sickness that causes you to resist in the first place. If something grosses you out, you feel repugnance for it. Repugnance can also express a feeling of moral horror: you probably feel repugnance at photographs of torture.</p></div></div>`;
