If you find yourself watching hours of TV every day, you should ask yourself: is it <i>escapism</i>, or just a really exciting show?</p><p class="long">When life gets difficult, escapism gives people a way to take a break from reality. A person's escapism might consist of playing video games, reading books, or fantasizing about living in a foreign country. Some see escapism as negative, hiding an underlying sadness or depression, while others insist that everyone indulges in escapism to some extent. The word was first used in the 1930s by US psychologists.</p></div>`;
