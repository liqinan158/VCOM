If you tend to never throw anything away, you might have your entire school <i>corpus</i>, from your first scribbled words to your high school English essays.</p><p class="long">The written works of an author, or from one specific time period, can be called a <i>corpus</i> if they're gathered together into a collection or talked about as a group. You could discuss the corpus of Dr. Seuss, for example. <i>Corpus</i> sounds a little like <i>corpse</i>, and that's no coincidence; <i>corpus</i> means "body" in Latin, and though it's come to mean specifically "body of work," the two words are closely related.</p></div>`;
