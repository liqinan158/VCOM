Roller <i>skates</i> have wheels on the bottom, and ice <i>skates</i> have metal blades.</p><p class="long">When you lace up your skates and start moving over the ice, you <i>skate</i>. You also skate when you head down the street to your friend's house on your skatesâ€”or on your skateboard. A totally different kind of <i>skate</i> is the sea creature that looks like a sting ray, with a wide, flat body.
