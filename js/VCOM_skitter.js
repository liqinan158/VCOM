Your cat might spend hours fascinated by the bugs that <i>skitter</i> across your window.</p><p class="long">Little kids will usually skitter onto a playground, moving much more slowly when it's time to leave. And while older cats spend much of the day sleeping lazily, playful kittens will skitter crazily around the house if you give them a crumpled ball of paper to play with. <i>Skitter</i> comes from an old verb, <i>skite</i>, "to dart or run quickly," probably from a Scandinavian root.</p></div></div>`;
