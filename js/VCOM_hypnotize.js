If you are looking to break a bad habit like cigarette smoking, ask someone to <i>hypnotize</i> you.</p><p class="long">To hypnotize is to induce a calm, focused state in one's self or in another person. The state is called hypnosis, and a person who can do this for someone else is a hypnotist. The word <i>hypnotize</i> comes from the Greek <i>hypnotikos</i>, "inclined to sleep or putting to sleep," and popular ideas of hypnosis reflect a kind of half-asleep state. In reality, when you hypnotize someone, the person remains awake and intently focused.</p></div></div>`;
