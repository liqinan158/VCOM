The word <i>garrison</i> is also used to refer to the troops stationed there.</p><p class="long"><i>Garrison</i> is from the Old French verb <i>garir</i>, meaning "defend, protect" is of Germanic origin, so you can see where the noun <i>garrison</i> gets its sense of a stronghold of defense. A great example is Hadrian's Wall, completed in 128 A.D. by the Roman emperor Hadrian. The wall was built across Scotland to protect settlements to the south from invaders, and it was dotted with around two dozen forts that could each hold a garrison of 500 soldiers.</p></div></div>`;
