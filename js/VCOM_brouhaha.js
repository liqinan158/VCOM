The title of the Shakespeare play gives one meaning: "Much Ado about Nothing."  The brouhaha over the latest Hollywood comedy might make you never want to see it.  It's just <i>fuss</i> and <i>hullabaloo</i> about a movie that can’t possibly be good anyway.  <i>Brouhaha</i> also means a loud noise coming from all over the place, like the brouhaha after a sporting event: <i>hubbub</i> and <i>katzenjammer</i> echoing loudly through the streets.</p></div></div>`;
