A <i>version</i> is a specific edition or form of something.</p><p class="long"><i>Version</i> derives from the Latin <i>vertere</i>, "to turn." Think of it as someone taking a turn, as in an adaptation of a work of art or literature. "Can you believe they made an animated <i>version</i> of <i>The Sinking of the Lusitania</i>?" Or someone giving their own account of an event. "Your <i>version</i> of what happened the night we got locked in the storage unit is totally different from mine!"</p></div>`;
