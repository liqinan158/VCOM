You can also enter a <i>contest</i> — a yodeling <i>contest</i> or a cake-decorating <i>contest</i>, depending on your talents.</p><p class="long">If you're being sued and you respond to the court order saying "no <i>contest</i>," you're saying you're not going to put up a fight. When you put the accent on the second syllable, <i>contest</i> becomes a verb, and it means to dispute something. You lost the election for class president, but you think there was something fishy going on at the ballot box, so you <i>contest</i> the results and ask for a recount.</p></div></div>`;
