A <i>producer</i> is a maker or manufacturer of something.</p><p class="long">Since the 1500s, the word <i>producer</i> has been used to mean "one who produces." In the late 1800s it began to have a second meaning, "someone who finances and supervises a show". A movie producer oversees the making of films in various ways, including raising money, and a record producer does a similar job in the music industry, working with musicians. This kind of producer is more of a supervisor and adviser than the actual maker of the finished product.</p></div>`;
