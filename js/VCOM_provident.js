You have your Christmas lights up in early December, you have a well-stocked pantry, and you have some savings tucked away just in case.</p><p class="long">The word <i>provident</i> traces back to the Latin word <i>providere,</i> meaning "foresee, provide." The word can be used to describe someone who looks into the future — foresees the future, in a sense — and makes decisions based on future needs. It’s often used to describe a thrifty individual who denies himself something today in order to save up for tomorrow, but it can describe actions as well — such as a provident decision that ends up preventing ruin down the road.</p></div>`;
