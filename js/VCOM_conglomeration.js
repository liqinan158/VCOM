People, companies, ideas, and other things can group together in <i>conglomerations</i>.</p><p class="long">If you ever want something and you're asked why, you could show off your vocabulary and say, "I have a <i>conglomeration</i> of reasons!" That means you have a bunch of reasons that may or may not be connected. A huge mob of people could be described as a conglomeration — which sounds nicer than "mob." The "with" should be a reminder that this is a word that brings things or people together. In the dictionary, you'll find a conglomeration of words — like "conversation" and "concert" — that use <i>con-</i> to suggest a bringing together.</p></div></div>`;
