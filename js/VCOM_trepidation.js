Some dictionaries note that <i>trepidation</i> carries connotations of apprehension about an upcoming threat. In most cases, though, you can get by with the simpler word  <i>fear</i> â€” why use three syllables when you could make do with one? The word comes from the Latin verb <i>trepidare</i>, "to tremble."</p></div>`;
