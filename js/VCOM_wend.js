The path may not always be the fastest route, but at least it should get you there. Eventually.</p><p class="long">It’s always good to have a goal, and that’s true with wending. You know where you want to go, so you wend your way there. You’ll notice that <i>wend</i> looks like the verb <i>wind</i>, and they both come from the same Old English <i>wendan</i>, which means “to turn, depart.”  When you wend, you may take curvy, windy roads, a more scenic route, some detours and side alleys, just for fun.  But don’t wend too much or you’ll be late.</p></div></div>`;
