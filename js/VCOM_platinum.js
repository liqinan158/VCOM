In the U.S., that means it sold a million copies, and platinum is the precious metal used to symbolize such success. Platinum is one of the periodic table of elements, and it's often found in copper and nickel ores. Platinum won't corrode, and its color is somewhere between grey and white. Another use of this term is when someone dyes their hair so blonde it’s almost white: that’s platinum blonde.</p></div>`;
