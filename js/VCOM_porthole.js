Originally, <i>porthole</i> applied only to the round windows on ships, initially used for firing weapons, and later simply a way to let in light and air. Though <i>port</i> is a common nautical term, <i>porthole</i> has a different source: the French <i>porte</i>, or "door," which first referred to the windows' watertight covers.</p></div></div>`;
