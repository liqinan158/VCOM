It used to be that only boys attended <i>yeshivas</i>, but today many of them are co-educational.</p><p class="long">Yeshivas have existed in various forms for thousands of years and are very important to Judaism. Yeshiva students study the Talmud and the Torah, as well as other religious books, and often take additional nonreligious classes. The scholarship at these schools varies between Orthodox and non-Orthodox branches, as well as between age groups.  The word <i>yeshiva</i> comes from the Hebrew <i>yesibah</i>, "academy," or literally "a sitting."</p></div></div>`;
