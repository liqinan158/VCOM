When you think of <i>flamboyant,</i> think of Las Vegas showgirls: feathers, sequins, three-inch heels, enough make-up to disguise any irregularity.</p><p class="long">Flamboyant means showy, and though we often roll our eyes at it, it's not a hateful thing. Liberace was flamboyant. So was Elvis. The word comes from the French <i>flamboyer,</i> to flame. Think of passion and pageantry all rolled into one, and you'll have a good idea what <i>flamboyant</i> should mean at its best. If that doesn't do it for you, think of a man playing a shiny white grand piano at a rock concert, wearing a white satin jump suit and 8-foot wide, fully-feathered wings. See? Flamboyant.</p></div>`;
