Ordering this way is also a la carte, like choosing individual pieces of sushi instead of an entire platter or meal. The literal meaning of the French phrase is "by the card," although it's used in both languages to mean "according to the menu." The opposite of <i>a la carte</i> is <i>a table d'h√¥te</i>, or "meal served at a fixed price."</p></div>`;
