A cold gust of wind might make you <i>quiver</i>, as would an icy glare from the abominable snowman.</p><p class="long">The verb to <i>quiver</i> means to shudder, wobble, or vibrate, often from fear. But the noun <i>quiver</i>? It's actually the carrying case for your arrows, just the kind of thing Robin Hood would have strapped to his back. So imagine one of his arrows sailing through the air, hitting a tree with a hearty <i>whack!</i>, and then quivering there for a few seconds.</p></div>`;
