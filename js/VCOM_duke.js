var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">duke</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>duke</i> is a member of a royal or noble group. In some places, <i>dukes</i> rule over certain regions, while in others <i>duke</i> is just an honorary title.</p><p class="long">In the U.K., a duke inherits his title from his parents. Prince William, for example, is the Duke of Cambridge, while his father Prince Charles is the Duke of Cornwall and Rothesay. The equivalent title for a woman is <i>duchess</i>. Informally, <i>duke</i> has a very different meaning in the U.S. â€” if you "duke it out," you have a fight, and to "put up your dukes" means to clench your fists and get ready to punch.</p></div>`;
