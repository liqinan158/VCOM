Before you initiate <i>retaliation</i> on someone who has wronged you, consider whether he or she might have a ninja alter ego and a set of nunchucks stashed away.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>retaliation</i> stems from the Latin <i>retaliare</i>, meaning “pay back in kind.” Notice the word <i>kind</i> in that definition. <i>Retaliation</i> used to have both good and evil connotations. Now, though, it’s important to read that <i>kind</i> as synonymous with <i>type</i> or <i>sort</i> because <i>retaliation</i> has since lost its positive sense. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, “Man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge, aggression and retaliation. The foundation of such a method is love.”</p></div>`;
