So if your dance moves have <i>elan</i>, you're feeling the groove with exceptional style and vigor.</p><p class="long"><i>Elan</i> comes from a French word meaning "to dart," and is often spelled <i>Ã©lan</i>. Someone with elan can be said to dart around with enthusiasm and a unique flair. Music or art can have elan, and so can someone's wardrobe. <i>Elan</i> can also mean zeal or eagerness in favor of a person or cause. So don't let this boring sounding noun fool you. <i>Elan</i> has a lot of pizazz up its sleeve.</p></div></div>`;
