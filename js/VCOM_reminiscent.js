Hopefully that doesn't mean your mother is still dressing you.</p><p class="long"><i>Reminiscent</i> traces back to the Latin for "remember." If a house is reminiscent of your childhood home, it makes you remember your childhood home. <i>Reminiscent</i> can have a good or bad implication. If you tell someone that her paintings are reminiscent of a chimp's finger paintings, obviously that's not so good. But if you tell her that they're reminiscent of Dali, well that might be better.</p></div>`;
