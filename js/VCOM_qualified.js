Employers seek the most qualified applicants, meaning those who have the most experience and relevant training. Being qualified might also mean you have paperwork that shows you had certain training or meet certain standards. Or <i>qualified</i> can mean "partial" or "incomplete." If you approve of something but others need to agree before it's final, you would give your qualified approval.</p></div></div>`;
