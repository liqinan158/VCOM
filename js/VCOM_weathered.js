And, the weathered Canadian flag your brother hung outside your house back when he was a hockey fan should probably be replaced with a Union Jack now that his favorite spectator sport is cricket. <i>Weathered</i> comes from the verb <i>weather</i>, which first meant just "come through safely," before gaining the meaning "wear away by exposure," like the paint on a boat over time.</p></div></div>`;
