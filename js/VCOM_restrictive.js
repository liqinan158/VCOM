A household where you aren't allowed to play video-games, watch TV, or eat junk food is <i>restrictive</i>.</p><p class="long">If you noticed that <i>restrictive</i> is wrapped around the word <i>strict</i>, you're on to something. <i>Strict</i> comes from the Latin <i>stringere</i>, and you can probably guess what that means, right?  Well, not "string," actually, but close: "to bind tight," either with string or rope or whatever does the job.  The kids in a restrictive household are kept from doing so many things they might as well be tied up.</p></div>`;
