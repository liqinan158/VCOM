If you work on a farm, you might be tempted to adopt the smallest <i>heifer</i> as your pet, based on cuteness alone.</p><p class="long">Heifers are female cows who have not yet given birth to a calf. Farmers can raise heifers for dairy or for meat. In the 1830s, <i>heifer</i>, which is pronounced "HEFF-er," was first used as slang for "woman" or "girl." Since then, it took on the meaning of a female who is obese. It is very rude to single people out because of the way they look and so <i>heifer</i> should never be used.</p></div></div>`;
