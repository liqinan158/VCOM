The person who inserts the needle, draws the blood, labels the test tubes, and puts a bandage on the patient's arm is called a <i>phlebotomist</i>. The original definition of <i>phlebotomy</i> was simply "bloodletting," from the Greek roots <i>phleps</i>, "vein," and <i>tomia</i>, "cutting off." Historically, early phlebotomy involved using leeches to suck "toxins" from patients' blood.</p></div>`;
