You might stand frozen in one position with your mouth and eyes wide open and <i>gawk</i> when you see a famous movie star on the street.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>gawk</i> was first recorded in American English in 1785. It may have evolved from the word <i>gaw</i>, which came from the Middle English word <i>gowen</i>, meaning "to stare." When you <i>gawk</i> at something, you get completely absorbed in what you're looking at. It's usually not considered polite behavior to <i>gawk</i> at another person, especially if it's someone you find attractive. After all, staring is rude.</p></div>`;
