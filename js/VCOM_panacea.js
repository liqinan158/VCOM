It’s a <i>panacea</i>, a remedy that falsely claims to solve every problem ever.</p><p class="long">The Greek word <i>pan</i> means “all” (think of a <i>pan</i>orama, a view where you can see everywhere).  The Greek word for “cure” is <i>akēs</i> (which looks like the word “aches”).  Those are the roots of <i>panacea</i>, a cure for all aches.  But a panacea doesn’t really cure everything; it just acts like it can.  Use the word to describe an unbelievable solution, like a new law that will make everyone rich, or a robot that does your homework for you.</p></div>`;
