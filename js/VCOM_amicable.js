The end of a romantic relationship that's less than <i>amicable</i> might involve broken dishes or broken bones.</p><p class="long"><i>Amicable</i>, not surprisingly, comes from the Latin word for "friend," <i>amicus</i>. Perhaps the things most commonly described as <i>amicable</i> are <i>divorces</i>. The parties in a divorce often tend to be so childish and the proceedings so messy that it's nice to have a word that reflects the absence of those qualities. Other nouns that commonly pair with <i>amicable</i> include <i>relationship, split, parting, solution,</i> and <i>breakup</i>.</p></div></div>`;
