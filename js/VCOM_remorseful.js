var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">remorseful</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The adjective <i>remorseful</i> is good for describing someone who is really, really sorry — like a teenager who borrows his parents' car without asking and drives it into a tree.</p><p class="long">Someone who feels remorseful has usually done something that he or she now feels guilty about. A defendant at a murder trial might be remorseful, and so might a little girl who has accidentally stepped on her cat's tail. The word <i>remorseful</i> means "full of remorse," and <i>remorse</i> comes from the Latin word <i>remordere</i>, "vex," or literally "to bite back." A popular phrase in Medieval Latin was <i>remorsus conscientiæ</i>, or "a biting back of one's conscience."</p></div></div>`;
