If you're a <i>temperate</i> person, you are calm, reasonable. If you live in a <i>temperate</i> climate, it's warm and sunny, but not too hot.</p><p class="long">Like other words that sound similar, <i>temperate</i> has to do with measurement and range. Temperatures measure how hot and cold things are and someone with a temper is hot-headed or intemperate, the opposite of this word. A temperate person's life motto is summed up by Goldilocks: not too hot and not too cold, just right.</p></div>`;
