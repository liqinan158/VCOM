As meat, fat, or oil decomposes the chemical change creates a sharp wretched stink that will cause you to recoil. It's just foul. The powerful horrendous fragrance of rancid butter, therefore, makes the word wonderfully potent to describe all sorts of things â€” from a corrupt dictatorship to a party that's gone on a few hours too long.</p></div></div>`;
