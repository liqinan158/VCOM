var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">ulster</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">An <i>ulster</i> is a long coat that was commonly worn in Victorian Britain. The overcoat that Sherlock Holmes usually wears in photos, movies, and TV shows is a good example of an <i>ulster</i>.</p><p class="long">This long, sturdy coat often has an attached cape and a belt, although more modern versions tend to omit the cape. These days, you're most likely to get a glimpse of an ulster on a period drama, like the TV series <i>Sherlock</i> or a filmed version of a Charles Dickens novel. The ulster wasn't a dressy type of outerwear; it was meant for a working man. The word comes from the name of the Irish province, Ulster, where these coats were originally made.</p></div>`;
