When you see the root <i>osteo</i>, you know that the word relates to “bone." The suffix <i>osis</i> tells you the word is probably a “condition.” The Greek root <i>poro</i> is pretty much the same as its English ancestor: it means “porous” or “passage.” So osteoporosis is a condition in which the bones are porous, or weak. Sufficient amounts of calcium can help prevent osteoporosis. Got milk?</p></div></div>`;
