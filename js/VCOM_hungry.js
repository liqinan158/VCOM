For some people, getting food isn’t so easy, and you’ll see poor folk on the street with a hungry look in their eyes.  If your <i>hunger</i> has a particular food in mind, you could say that you are "hungry for” that food, like being hungry for macaroni right after seeing a commercial about macaroni.</p></div>`;
