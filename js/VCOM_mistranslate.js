It's easy to <i>mistranslate</i> a poem when you convert it from Spanish to English, failing to make its original meaning clear.</p><p class="long">When someone literally mistranslates a piece of writing or a section of speech, they use the wrong words when translating from one language to another. You can also mistranslate the intention of someone's words, even if you're not actually translating between two languages: "I managed to <i>mistranslate</i> my grandmother's message when I gave it to the gardener." <i>Translate</i> means "turn from one language to another," and <i>mis-</i> means "badly."</p></div></div>`;
