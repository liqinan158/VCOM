The basic goal in <i>tennis</i> is hitting the ball across a net.</p><p class="long">There are two types of tennis: singles, when two individuals face off, and doubles, which involves teams of two players. If you can hit a tennis ball with a racket, you can play tennis. Historians believe that tennis grew out of a 12th century French game called <i>la paulme</i>, "the palm," in which players hit a ball with their hands. The word <i>tennis</i> comes from the Anglo-French <i>tenetz</i>, "Hold! Take! Receive!" which players called out before serving.</p></div>`;
