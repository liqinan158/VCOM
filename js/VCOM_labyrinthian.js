These labyrinthian locations can be corn mazes, doctor's offices, or underground caves. The Greek root <i>labyrinthos</i> refers to the ancient myth in which Daedalus built a maze (or <i>labyrinth</i>) to contain the monster known as the Minotaur â€” it was so complex, that Daedalus himself could barely escape!</p></div></div>`;
