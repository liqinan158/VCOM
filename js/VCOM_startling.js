A surprise party, if it's planned right, is startling, and it can be startling the first time you meet your best friend's identical twin sister. Alarm clocks, smoke alarms, and barking dogs can all be equally startling. They <i>startle</i> you â€” and <i>startle</i> comes from <i>start</i>, with its Old English root <i>styrtan</i>, "to leap up."</p></div></div>`;
