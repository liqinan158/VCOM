A fearless stunt pilot does loops and rolls that appear impossible from the ground, and a fearless animal trainer doesn't flinch from a roaring lion. Others are fearless in the face of less physical dangers: "She is fearless on the Senate floor, bravely facing down her political opponents."</p></div></div>`;
