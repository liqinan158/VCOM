If you’re super rich, you ride around in a private jet while the <i>masses</i> take crowded buses.</p><p class="long">The masses don’t include celebrities, rich people, royalty, or political leaders. The masses are everybody else. People use this term when they need to speak generally about the majority, although it often refers to the lower class. To win an election, a politician must appeal to the masses. Popular movies and music also must appeal to the masses — in other words, they need mass appeal. The word <i>masses</i> is also just plural for any kind of <i>mass</i>.</p></div></div>`;
