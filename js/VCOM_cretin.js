Surprisingly, the root of <i>cretin</i> is the Swiss French word <i>crestin</i>, which means “Christian.”  It seems that people back then wanted to remind themselves that even though cretins look unusual, they’re still humans who deserve kindness.  Knowing this makes it hard to use <i>cretin</i> in a mean way, but there are plenty more rude words you could use.</p></div></div>`;
