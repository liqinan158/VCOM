Horses manducate mouthfuls of hay and little kids who are new to trick-or-treating might want to manducate each piece of candy as it's dropped in their treat bag on Halloween. While <i>chew</i> is a far more common word than <i>manducate</i>, even <i>masticate</i> is used more often. <i>Manducate</i> is rooted in the Latin <i>manducat-</i>, "chewed," from <i>mandere</i>, "to chew."</p></div></div>`;
