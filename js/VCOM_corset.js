As fashion has changed over time, the shape and construction of corsets has also changed — today, while corsets are mainly worn as costumes or for medical reasons, many women still wear "foundation garments," which differ from corsets only in material — the modern version is made of stretchy fabric rather than stiff bones or metal. <i>Corset</i> is an Old French word, from <i>cors</i>, or "body."</p></div></div>`;
