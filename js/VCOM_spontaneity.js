The writer Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “Our spontaneous action is always the best. You cannot, with your best deliberation and heed, come so close to any question as your spontaneous glance shall bring you.” He meant that if we learn to trust our instincts instead of weighing the potential consequences of everything we do, we'll make better decisions.</p></div>`;
