Some people keep fuzzy spiders as pets, and others are truly <i>terrified</i> of them.</p><p class="long">Certain situations cause almost anyone to be terrified: nearly falling off a tall building, seeing someone you love get very sick, or being chased down a dark alley by a lumbering monster. Other things that make you feel terrified might be your individual fears, such as speaking in public or riding in elevators. When you're terrified, you're full of terror, or a panicked fear. The root word is Latin, <i>terrificare</i>, which means "to frighten."</p></div>`;
