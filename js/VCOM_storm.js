If the weather report says that a <i>storm</i> is on the way, you might want to carry an umbrella â€” or just stay at home and watch movies.</p><p class="long">Storms range from the windstorm that blows branches off your tree to the snowstorm that buries your neighborhood under two feet of the white stuff. It's a verb too: "It began to <i>storm</i> outside, and the rain beat down on the windows." Figuratively, you might even storm angrily: "My sister was so mad that she <i>stormed</i> around her room, kicking things." Something controversial can also cause a figurative storm, or uproar.</p></div>`;
