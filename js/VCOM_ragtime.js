The bouncing, energetic rhythms of <i>ragtime</i> were ideal dance music.</p><p class="long">Ragtime is credited with being the first African-American musical form; jazz, which was strongly influenced by ragtime, followed soon afterward. While distinctions between the two genres vary, ragtime is generally described as piano-based and in duple meter, with two main beats per measure. The syncopated ragtime sound became enormously popular after the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. Today, Scott Joplin is probably the most well-known ragtime composer. <i>Ragtime</i> comes from the American dialect word <i>rag</i>, "dance ball."</p></div></div>`;
