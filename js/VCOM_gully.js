Most <i>gullies</i> form along hillsides.</p><p class="long">When a stream or runoff from a heavy rainfall erodes the land and forms a ravine or ditch, the result is a <i>gully</i>. The origin of the word is unclear, but it may come from the Middle English <i>golet</i>, "water channel." If you hear someone use the somewhat old fashioned term "<i>gully</i> washer," they're talking about a torrential rain storm â€” one that's heavy enough to form a gully.</p></div>`;
