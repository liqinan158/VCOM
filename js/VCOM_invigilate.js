The two words sound similar but occupy different grammatical positions within a sentence. You interrogate a person, meaning you ask them questions, but you invigilate a test, meaning you watch its administration. You don't invigilate a test-taker, even if they are the ones whom you, as a test's invigilator, want to interrogate when your suspicions of cheating are aroused. The word derives from the Latin <i>vigilare</i>, which means "to watch over."</p></div>`;
