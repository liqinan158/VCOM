The word <i>elapse</i> comes from the Latin word <i>elabi</i> which means "to slip away." Time is one of those things that really does tend to slip away, unless you're sitting through a lecture on the nature of time. Then, it might feel like years elapse when really it is just a few minutes.</p></div></div>`;
