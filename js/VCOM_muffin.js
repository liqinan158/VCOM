Don't kid yourself: the only real difference between a slice of cake and a <i>muffin</i> is the shape.</p><p class="long">Muffins are single-serving quick breads, which rise with the help of baking soda or baking powder and eggs instead of yeast. They tend to be sweet and somewhat moist, but heavier than a cake or cupcake. Muffins are baked in a pan with cup-sized indentations. The word was originally <i>moofin</i>, which may come from the Low German <i>muffe</i>, "small cake," or the Old French <i>moflet</i>, "soft or tender."</p></div>`;
