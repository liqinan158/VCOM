If you're always <i>candid</i>, your parents will know that they can trust you.</p><p class="long">A serious-minded politician might suggest engaging in a "candid discussion" about a complicated topic like health care or the environment, because <i>candid</i> means "open" or "frank." Remember that TV show <i>Candid Camera</i>? It was called that because its hidden cameras supposedly showed a candid view of reality. In photography, <i>candid</i> has become a noun meaning "an unposed photo." The word comes from Latin <i>candidus</i>, meaning "white," which was later extended to mean "pure." Candid talk provides the pure, unvarnished truth.</p></div>`;
