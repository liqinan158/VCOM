To <i>discuss</i> usually implies a certain amount of serious talking. This can apply to writing as well: essays discuss topics, usually in a careful, thorough way. On the other hand, sometimes <i>discuss</i> means exactly the same thing as <i>talk</i> or <i>converse</i>. Like all words, the meaning depends on how itâ€™s used.</p></div></div>`;
