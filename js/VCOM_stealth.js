When you do something with stealth, you do it so quietly and carefully that no one notices. You might admire the stealth of your cat when she sneaks up on a mouse.</p><p class="long"><i>Stealth</i> and <i>steal</i> come from the same root word and used to mean the same thing. Stealth is still a certainly a quality useful in stealing, but the meaning has branched out. It can also be something quietly done in secret. For example, a stealth bomber is an aircraft that's hard to detect by radar. Or if you plan a birthday party by stealth, then the guest of honor will be pleasantly surprised.</p></div>`;
