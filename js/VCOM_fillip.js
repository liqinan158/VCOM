Giving away one free candy bar with every dozen purchased might give a <i>fillip</i> to your candy-selling business.</p><p class="long">When economies or markets get a fillip, they move or grow in a positive direction, and if your confidence gets a fillip after you get a good grade, it's a boost to your morale. An older, now obsolete meaning of <i>fillip</i> was "a flick of the finger," sort of a soft snap, and as a verb, "to flip something with the fingers" or "to snap."</p></div>`;
