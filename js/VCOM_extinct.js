var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">extinct</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Something that no longer exists and has no living representative is <i>extinct.</i> Dinosaurs are extinct. Polar bears may become <i>extinct.</i> Sadly, history teachers who force their students to memorize long lists of dates are in no danger of becoming <i>extinct.</i></p><p class="long">You often hear of a species being <i>extinct</i>: there are no living representatives of the species left. But <i>extinct</i> also describes something that has gone out or grown cold, as in a dormant volcano "<i>extinct</i> volcano" or a tobacco pipe whose flame has died out "<i>extinct</i> pipe." Thatâ€™s because <i>extinct</i> comes from the Latin <i>extinguere</i>/<i>exstinguere</i> for "extinguish." Originally <i>extinct</i> referred to fires that died out (were extinguished). Its meaning grew to encompass a family line and then a species.</p></div></div>`;
