One is ornithology: the study of birds. This includes tiny birds like finches and huge birds like vultures. Ornithologists study bird songs, feathers, migration patterns, and everything else about birds. People who are experts in ornithology — ornithologists — go to graduate school, but you don't have to study birds in school to be interested. Birdwatchers know a lot of ornithology too.</p></div>`;
