If you travel to the underworld to speak to the dead, then you have the power of necromancy, not to mention <i>geomancy</i>, the ability to read signs from the earth to find the <i>necropolis</i>, or city of the dead. As you might guess, necromancy isn’t discussed much these days. But if you’re reading about old witch trials, you might find accusations of necromancy abound.</p></div></div>`;
