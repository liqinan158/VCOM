Your habit of smiling and saying hello to everyone you pass on the street is evidence of your <i>cordiality</i>.</p><p class="long">People who show cordiality are polite, kind, and pleasant, but the word implies a bit of reserve: you might appreciate the cordiality among the employees at your after-school job, but your relationships with your closest friends and family are characterized by an emotion deeper than cordiality. At the root of <i>cordiality</i> is the Latin word <i>cor</i>, or "heart."</p></div>`;
