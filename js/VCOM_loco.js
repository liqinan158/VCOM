Your friends will think your dog is completely <i>loco</i> if she spends hours every day chasing her own tail.</p><p class="long">You can use the slang term <i>loco</i> when you're commenting on the craziness or irrationality of a person or situation. You might say, for example: "This meeting is totally <i>loco</i> â€” everyone's talking at the same time!" <i>Loco</i> comes from American English, which borrowed it from the Spanish <i>loco</i>, "insane." Its roots are uncertain, but it may stem from the Arabic <i>lauqa</i>, "fool."</p></div></div>`;
