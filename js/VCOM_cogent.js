In these days of 24-hour entertainment news and sound-bite sized explanations of complex government policy, it’s hard to find a <i>cogent</i> argument amidst all the emotional outbursts.</p><p class="long"><i>Cogent</i> comes from a Latin word meaning to drive together, so cogent thinking is well-organized: it hangs together. If you try to convince your mayor to build a new park by saying that playgrounds are good, seeing the sky is nice, and raccoons are cool…well that’s not a cogent argument; it’s just random. But you could cogently argue that parks contribute to civic happiness by providing space for exercise, community, and encounters with nature.</p></div>`;
