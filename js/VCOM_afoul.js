When a prank falls <i>afoul</i> of the law, it crosses the line from just a joke to something much more serious.</p><p class="long">Use the adjective <i>afoul</i> to describe things that conflict or clash. If a politician goes afoul of the rules about using taxpayer money for person items, she's bound to pay for it in votes. Likewise, a party guest might accidentally go afoul of the etiquette about how much candy to grab from a fallen pi√±ata. The original nineteenth century meaning of <i>afoul</i> was nautical, describing tangled ropes or lines on a ship.</p></div>`;
