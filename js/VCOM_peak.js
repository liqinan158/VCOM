The noun <i>peak</i> can refer to something that is a literal highpoint, like that snow-covered peak over there in the distance, but you will also hear it used to refer to more abstract high points, such as a time of greatest success (“at the <i>peak</i> of your career”) or top performance (“the stock price reached a <i>peak</i> over the summer”) or highest level (“the <i>peak</i> of the flu season”). The word also has a verb form (“Don’t <i>peak</i> to soon”) and an adjective form (“<i>peak</i> productivity”) that carry similar meanings.</p></div></div>`;
