A stanchion stands straight up, and it supports a larger structure. In just about any building, you will see posts going from the floor to the ceiling: those are stanchions. Stanchions are part of many walls too. If you took the stanchions out, the building might fall down. Stanchions always go up and down; they're vertical and provide support.</p></div>`;
