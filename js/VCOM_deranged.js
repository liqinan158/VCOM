You've probably read headlines about <i>deranged</i> murderers, but someone might also be called <i>deranged</i> for bizarre behavior like wearing a bathing suit while skiing.</p><p class="long"><i>Crazed</i>, <i>insane</i>, <i>demented</i>, <i>unbalanced</i>, and <i>unhinged</i> are all synonyms for <i>deranged</i>. The literal meaning for <i>deranged</i> was originally “out of order," so think of it as describing someone whose thoughts are not in order. The madwoman in Bronte’s <i>Jane Eyre</i> is a classic deranged character: “In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure ran backwards and forwards. What it was, whether beast or human being, one could not, at first sight tell.”</p></div></div>`;
