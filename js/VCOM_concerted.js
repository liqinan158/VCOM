As you may have guessed, <i>concerted</i> comes from the word <i>concert</i>. While a <i>concert</i> can be defined as "a group of musicians playing cooperatively," <i>concert</i> can also designate other types of cooperative behavior. If a group of people do anything together — from singing an annoying song to throwing library books at agreed-upon targets — they are acting in concert, or in a concerted manner.</p></div>`;
