If you give a <i>testimonial</i> on behalf of a restaurant, then you really like that restaurant.</p><p class="long">If you've seen the word <i>testimony</i> — meaning spoken evidence in court — then you might have a clue to the meaning of <i>testimonial</i>. Like testimonies, a testimonial is evidence or proof of something good: getting an A in math is a testimonial to your math skills. Testimonials can also be a spoken or written endorsement of something: You might write a testimonial about the awesome cupcakes on your favorite bakery's website, for example.</p></div></div>`;
