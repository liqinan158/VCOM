The most famous example is the 20th century conflict between the U.S. and Russia.</p><p class="long">Of all the types of war, a cold war is probably the most peaceful, since itâ€™s a conflict by other means. During the cold war between the U.S. and Russia, both countries tried to outdo the other in space exploration. The arms race was a big part of the cold war, as both countries stockpiled missiles to keep up with the other. A cold war can include anything except direct conflict, which would make the cold war hot.</p></div></div>`;
