"The <i>Loco-motion</i>" is also a dance-song popularized by Grand Funk Railroad. Google it; you won't be sorry.</p><p class="long">"Come on baby, do the loco-motion!" See the word <i>motion</i> in <i>locomotion</i>? That's a clue that this word has to do with movement. An animal is capable of locomotion if it can move on its own. For example, a dog's legs and a bird's wings give them locomotion. Our legs are our tools for locomotion too. Locomotion is also an instance of traveling. If you get on a train, thatâ€™s locomotion.</p></div>`;
