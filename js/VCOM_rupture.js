A <i>rupture</i> can be a literal break, like the one that happens in, say, a gas line, or it can be more figurative, as in a friendship or a business deal.</p><p class="long">The oil spill was less of a spill than it was a <i>rupture</i>: the line leading to the well was severed, allowing the oil to flow into the ocean. <i>Rupture</i> works as both a noun and a verb. You can rupture the silence by screaming your head off, and any number of events in <i>Star Trek</i> can cause a <i>rupture</i> in the space-time continuum.</p></div></div>`;
