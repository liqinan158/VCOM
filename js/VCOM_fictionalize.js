A lot of writers use this technique to turn their own experiences and real people they know into interesting stories. If you're writing a story for school about the time your friend forged a note from his mom to excuse his absence, you might decide to fictionalize him so he doesn't get in trouble. <i>Fictionalize</i> comes from a Latin root, <i>fingere</i>, "to shape or form."</p></div>`;
