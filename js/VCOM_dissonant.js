When a noise is dissonant, it sounds like it's broken apart, or not meshing together well. <i>Dissonant</i> doesn't have to describe just music or sounds.  It can also refer to something that clashes or doesn't fit well together. When two people's versions of a story are dissonant, that means they don't match. Either one of them is lying or they just don't see eye-to-eye.</p></div>`;
