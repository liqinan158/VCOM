Without <i>pagination</i>, it would be hard to know how many pages of "Moby Dick" you have left to read.</p><p class="long">Pagination is important, especially when two or more people discuss a book â€” you can say, "I love what happens on page 94," and the members of your book group will turn to page 94, thanks to pagination. Pagination can be as easy as clicking "print" and watching your printer automatically number each page of your essay. Before the invention of the printing press, all pagination had to be done by hand, no matter how long the document.</p></div></div>`;
