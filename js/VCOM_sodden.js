When it's been raining for days, there are puddles everywhere, and the grass is thoroughly soaked, it's safe to say the ground is <i>sodden</i>.</p><p class="long">Coming from the Middle English word for "boiled," <i>sodden</i> is certainly closely tied with lots and lots of liquid. Saturated, soppy, and soaking, anything that's sodden is drenched to the core and probably a mess. That goes for people, too: You can call someone <i>sodden</i> if they're acting foolish or dull, especially if they've had too much to drink.</p></div>`;
