You might talk about the founder of a nation, the founder of club, or the founder of a website. As a verb, <i>founder</i> can mean “stumble,” like when you trip and fall, but more generally it means "collapse or fall apart." A sports team might founder by slumping on a ten-game losing streak; a ship that sinks in a bad storm can be said to have foundered at sea.</p></div>`;
