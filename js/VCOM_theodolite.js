A theodolite is an instrument for measuring angles, especially horizontal ones. The Latin prefix <i>theo</i>, which often means "god," here probably has nothing to do with deities. <i>Theodolite</i> was coined from the Latin <i>theodelitus</i> in the sixteenth century, but even experienced etymologists scratch their heads as to how the word was formed.</p></div></div>`;
