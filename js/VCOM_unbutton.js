If your formal clothes feel uncomfortable, you might take off your tie and unbutton your top shirt button. You can also figuratively unbutton, by becoming more relaxed and uninhibited: "Kick off your shoes and unbutton a little â€” we're at the beach!" <i>Unbutton</i> comes from adding <i>un-</i>, "opposite of," to the verb <i>button</i>, "fasten with buttons."</p></div></div>`;
