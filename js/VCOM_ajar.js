A door that has been left <i>ajar</i> is easily pushed open by the wind or a nosy person.</p><p class="long">To correctly pronounce <i>ajar</i>, say "uh-JAR." People in a hurry leave drawers and cabinet doors ajar, or hanging open. If a chime starts ringing when you start a car, a door or the trunk may be ajar. Check that everything is securely closed before taking off. But don't describe a mouth that is open in surprise as <i>ajar</i>. A better word choice is <i>agape</i>.</p></div>`;
