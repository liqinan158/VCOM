Maybe that’s why they’re so mad.</p><p class="long">Roughnecks weren’t always brutes — the term comes from Texas and used to just refer to a “rugged individual.” Then it was a word for someone who worked on an oil rig. But now a roughneck is someone, usually a big man, who’s tough, crude, and ready to fight. Roughnecks are the opposite of mild-mannered people. Roughnecks are uneducated and foul-mouthed. They’re the kind of people your parents warn you about.</p></div></div>`;
