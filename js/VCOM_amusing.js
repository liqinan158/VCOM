Something that you find <i>amusing</i>, like your favorite stand up comic, might be less <i>amusing</i> to your easily offended grandmother.</p><p class="long">A pastime that's enjoyably diverting can also be described as <i>amusing</i>, like playing board games on a rainy day. <i>Amusing</i> comes from the verb <i>amuse</i>, which is itself from the Middle French word <i>amuser</i>. Interestingly, <i>amuser</i> meant "to stare at stupidly," and the English word originally meant "to deceive by distraction." The more benign funny and enjoyable meanings didn't arise until much later, but they eventually made the original meaning obsolete.</p></div></div>`;
