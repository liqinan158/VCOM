After you swipe your subway card, you can move through the <i>turnstile</i> into the station.</p><p class="long">Turnstiles are used to control and restrict people who are entering an area like a train station or office building. Many turnstiles are used in places where an entry fee is required. Two people can't fit through a turnstile at once, so they are also used to keep an accurate count of how many people pass through. The earliest turnstiles were used by shepherds, allowing them to exit a pen while keeping sheep inside.</p></div></div>`;
