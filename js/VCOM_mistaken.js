If you think your guidance counselor is <i>mistaken</i> about what you should do with your life, you will probably ignore his advice.</p><p class="long">If you see a car speeding through town, you might assume the driver is a teenager â€” but you'd be mistaken if the car is actually driven by an elderly lady. You also might believe someone else is mistaken if their opinion seems wrong to you: "You think strawberry ice cream is better than chocolate, but you're <i>mistaken</i>." <i>Mistaken</i> comes from <i>mistake</i>, from its Old Norse root <i>mistaka</i>, "take in error."</p></div>`;
