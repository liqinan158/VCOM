var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">batty</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If someone's <i>batty</i>, she's eccentric or a little bit wacky. You might love it when your <i>batty</i> great aunt visits because she makes life so interesting.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>batty</i> can be derogatory — as when you dismiss a mentally ill person as batty — or fond, as when you praise your batty English teacher, who quotes Shakespeare while doing handstands. If someone says, "You are driving me <i>batty</i>," it means you're making them feel crazy. <i>Batty</i> originally meant "like a bat," with the "eccentric" meaning arising from the expression "bats in the belfry," which means "crazy" or "not right in the head."</p></div>`;
