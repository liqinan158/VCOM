Also, people act in a <i>venomous</i> way when they are cruel, evil, or deliberately harmful.</p><p class="long">Both senses of <i>venomous</i> have to do with poison. The first meaning is literal: if a venomous snake bites you, you could die. Venomous animals are extremely dangerous, and their bite requires immediate medical attention. For people, being venomous is a little different. Spreading lies is venomous. Stealing someone's significant other is venomous. Anytime someone is being destructive on purpose, it's venomous. For people, <i>venomous</i> means something close to <i>villainous</i> â€” being venomous is like spreading metaphorical poison.</p></div></div>`;
