Most <i>velds</i> have plenty of low-growing plants for grazing animals, but hardly any trees.</p><p class="long">This word, which can also be spelled <i>veldt</i>, came to English from the Dutch-influenced language Afrikaans (in both languages, <i>veld</i> means "field"). If you visit a wildlife preserve in South Africa or Zimbabwe, it's likely to be in a veld. In fact, you're likely to encounter other kinds of velds in this region of Africa, as the word is commonly used in its original sense â€” if you attend a rugby match, it'll be held in a "rugbyveld."</p></div>`;
