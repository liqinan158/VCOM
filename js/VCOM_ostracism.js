Quakers, for example, faced <i>ostracism</i> by Puritans in colonial Massachusetts and many of them fled to the nearby colony of Rhode Island.</p><p class="long"><i>Ostracism</i> comes from the Greek word <i>ostrakon</i>, a broken shard of pottery. Athenians used pieces of  pottery as a paper substitute in an annual vote in which citizens chose to banish someone from Athens for a period of ten years. The banished person had to leave (or face death) but was allowed to keep his property and could return when his ostracism was up. The vote was often used to get rid of potential tyrants and political rivals.</p></div></div>`;
