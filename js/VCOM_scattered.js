var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">scattered</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When things are <i>scattered</i>, they’re spread out all over the place. If the forecast calls for <i>scattered</i> showers, it’ll rain here and there.</p><p class="long">Items lying at random intervals and at some distance from each other can be described as <i>scattered</i>. Your birthday cake might be scattered with sprinkles, and the floor of your little sister's room might be scattered with Lego blocks. Another meaning of <i>scattered</i> is "messy" or "disordered" — you can describe yourself as scattered if you're feeling disorganized and confused. The word <i>scatter</i> is probably related to <i>shatter</i>, "break into pieces," from a Middle English root.</p></div></div>`;
