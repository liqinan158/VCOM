Your friends might call you an incurable optimist â€” this means you always see the glass as half-full, and there's no changing your cheerful nature. <i>Incurable</i> combines the prefix <i>in-</i>, "not," and <i>curable</i>, from the Latin <i>cura</i>, "care or concern," and also "means of healing."</p></div>`;
