Eventually, it came to mean a type of variety show that mixed comedy and music. Vaudeville, or "music hall," was popular between the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth. Vaudeville performers were multi-talented, because they might have to tell a joke one minute, dance the next, and then sing. The word <i>vaudeville</i> comes from the French phrase <i>voix de ville</i>, "voice of the city."</p></div></div>`;
