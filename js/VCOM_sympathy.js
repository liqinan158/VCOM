So have sympathy for people who confuse this word with <i>empathy</i> — they're awfully close in meaning. Feeling <i>sympathy</i> means you feel sorry for someone's situation, even if you've never been there yourself. <i>Empathy</i> is when you truly understand and can feel what another person is going though.</p></div>`;
