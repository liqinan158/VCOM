If you have ever been accused of "living in the past," you cling to what was instead of reveling in what is. If you hear that a person or a rare object in an antique store "has a past," get ready for a colorful story. As an adjective, <i>past</i> describes what is no longer current, like the past president of a club or past fashion craze — it's over: its time has passed.</p></div>`;
