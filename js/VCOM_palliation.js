It's a kind of care that makes you feel better, even though it can't cure you.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>palliation</i> is used by doctors, nurses, or hospice workers who try to make their patients more comfortable, often because their illnesses are incurable. You can also use the word to talk about anything that eases someone's pain or anxiety, like a funny movie that distracts your grandmother from her worries. The Latin root word is <i>palliat</i>, or "cloaked," and palliation does in a sense cloak or mask a person's pain.</p></div></div>`;
