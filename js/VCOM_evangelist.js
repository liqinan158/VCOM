Unlike other religious words — such as <i>prayer</i> and <i>God</i> — this word is specifically limited to the Christian faith. With a capital <i>e</i>, Evangelist refers specifically to the authors of the Gospels in the New Testament. Sometimes the word is used more loosely when people say someone is an evangelist for a cause, such as vegetarianism or health care: that means they're a strong believer in and proponent of the cause.</p></div>`;
