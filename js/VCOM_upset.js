You can be <i>upset</i>, and you can also <i>upset</i> someone — but you probably didn’t mean to.</p><p class="long"><i>Upset</i> has multiple senses. It generally refers to something that has been knocked over, turned upside down, or disturbed. Just as your coffee cup can be upset — knocked over or disturbed –- so can your emotions –- and your stomach. <i>Upset</i> can also refer to an unexpected victory. You might be so upset by the upset of your favorite team that you upset your table in frustration.</p></div></div>`;
