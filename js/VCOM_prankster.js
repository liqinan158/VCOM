If your house gets rolled in the night, a <i>prankster</i> hung toilet paper all over the trees in your yard. Congratulations?</p><p class="long">To be a prankster, you need a mischievous sense of humor and enough imagination to dream up practical jokes. You could glue a ten-dollar bill to the floor, change your sister's computer settings to Portuguese, or leave your fake bug collection on your teacher's chair. These tricks or hoaxes are also called <i>pranks</i>, the origin of <i>prankster</i>, which probably stems from the obsolete verb <i>prank</i>, "decorate or dress up."</p></div>`;
