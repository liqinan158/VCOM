You might wait with a tour group in an <i>anteroom</i> before beginning your tour of a castle.</p><p class="long">You can use the word <i>anteroom</i> as a fancy, old-fashioned way to say "waiting room" or "vestibule." Museum visitors might pause in an anteroom before entering a large gallery, and the butler in an old movie might say, "Please wait in the <i>anteroom</i>." Another word for an anteroom is an <i>antechamber</i> â€” in fact the French root of both is <i>antichambre</i>, from the Latin <i>anticamera</i>, "room in front."</p></div></div>`;
