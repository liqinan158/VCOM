He has to <i>stimulate</i>â€”turn it on, bring it to life, perk it up. You can <i>stimulate</i> practically anything: a person, a conversation, a mind, or even the growth of a plant.</p><p class="long"><i>Stimulate</i> is often used to describe a physical or sexual sensation, but don't get bogged down in that kind of thinking. Often, a government will try to <i>stimulate</i> economic activity by creating a stimulus package. Or, say, for example, that I'm trying to sell my new song CD. In order to stimulate interest, I need to send out a sample song to all my friends. Unless, of course, my songs are no good.</p></div></div>`;
