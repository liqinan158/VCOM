An <i>earl</i> is ranked above a viscount or a baron, in case you know those titles. <i>Earl</i> certainly carries more clout than "Mister"!</p><p class="long">One of the ceremonial titles given to noblemen in the United Kingdom is <i>earl</i>. Being an earl used to come with a great deal of power and control over a certain region, including the authority to pass judgment in courts of law. While it's still prestigious to be an earl, there's less actual power involved in the position. The word itself comes from the Old English word <i>eorl</i>, "brave man, warrior, leader, or chief."</p></div>`;
