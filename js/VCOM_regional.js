The local weather forecast covers your city and perhaps a few suburbs; the <i>regional</i> forecast gives you more: maybe a slew of counties, maybe the whole state, maybe even several states.</p><p class="long">People who write dictionaries like to think of <i>regional</i> as being a precise term, having to do with well-defined geographic and cultural areas within larger nations: like regional cuisines, regional customs and even, in places like the Great Lakes, regional weather patterns. But lots of times <i>regional</i> is fuzzier than that. A regional high school has students from more than one town, but just how many towns depends on other factors â€” the local political structure, the number of kids in the area, and the like.</p></div>`;
