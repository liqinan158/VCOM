The <i>blinding</i> light of a camera flash can be very annoying.</p><p class="long">The bright or dazzling light of fireworks, a flashlight, or even light glinting off of a mirror or a diamond necklace can all be blinding, rendering you briefly unable to see. Anything you can't see through can be described this way, like blinding rain or the blinding white of a blizzard, and even pain is sometimes blinding. The word shares an Old English root with <i>blind</i>, <i>blendan</i>, "to deprive of sight."</p></div></div>`;
