In the mythology around the character of Faust, he is described as having sold his soul to the devil for "unlimited knowledge and worldly pleasures." Both Christopher Marlowe and Goethe used Faustian characters in their plays, and to this day people talk about making a "<i>Faustian</i> bargain," sacrificing personal integrity for something desirable.</p></div></div>`;
