You might view the broken toaster as <i>junk</i>, while your sister sees it as an interesting repair project.</p><p class="long">After an accident, your car might be junk, and if it's hauled off to a scrapyard, you can say you had to <i>junk</i> it, using the verb meaning "to throw it away." One person's junk, however, is another person's valuable metal that can be sold to recycling companies. A completely different, non-trashy kind of <i>junk</i> is a Chinese sailing ship. These uses are connected through the nautical origin of <i>junk</i>, originally spelled <i>junke</i> and meaning "old rope or cable."</p></div>`;
