The <i>scalloped</i> hem on those curtains you made really suits the 1950s style of your kitchen.</p><p class="long">You can use this adjective for anything that resembles a repeated scallop shell, like a little girl's scalloped  skirt or the pretty pillows with scalloped pillowcases at your grandparents' house. When it comes to cooking, <i>scalloped</i> can describe a decorative pie crust, but it usually means "cooked in milk or cream or covered in breadcrumbs." This term probably stems from a tradition of baking this type of dish inside a scallop shell.</p></div></div>`;
