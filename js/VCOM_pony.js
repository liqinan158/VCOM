A pony is smaller than a horse, with shorter legs, although often thicker and sturdier proportionally through the body. To <i>pony up</i>, on the other hand, doesn't have anything to do with equines: it means to pay money: "If you want a cup of lemonade, you'll have to pony up a dollar."</p></div></div>`;
