var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">established</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Something or someone well <i>established</i> is well known, totally trusted and usually has a proven track record of success.</p><p class="long">Becoming established doesn't happen overnight. You've got to put in the time and effort to prove yourself, make connections and build a good reputation. So it makes sense that this adjective is related to the verb <i>establish</i>, which means to "create, set up, or prove." <i>Established</i> is a handy word to know, especially when you're looking for a dentist â€” you probably won't want to try Dr. Lovedrill until his practice is more established.</p></div>`;
