Most female sheep, or ewes, give birth to one or two <i>lambs</i> each spring. <i>Lambs</i> are so cute that they tend to show up in nursery rhymes â€” as in "Mary had a little <i>lamb</i>." Awwww.</p><p class="long">When you're petting a newborn sheep, you can call it a <i>lamb</i>, but if you're eating meat that comes from this same animal, it's a mass noun, <i>lamb</i> without the <i>a</i>. The word can be a verb too, as when a ewe lambs, or gives birth, and it's been a common pet name, especially for a young child, since at least the eleventh century: "Okay, time for bed, <i>lamb</i>!"</p></div></div>`;
