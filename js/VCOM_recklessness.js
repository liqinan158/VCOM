A speeding driver's <i>recklessness</i> can result in the loss of their license.</p><p class="long">While recklessness can be relatively innocent â€” think of the recklessness of kids doing wild tricks on their skateboards or the recklessness of your friend not doing his homework because he doubts there will really be a math quiz tomorrow. Some kinds of recklessness are more serious, like when your sister accepts a dare to jump off the garage roof onto a trampoline. <i>Recklessness</i> comes from the obsolete <i>reck</i>, "pay heed to something."</p></div></div>`;
