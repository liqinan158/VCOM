Brushing your teeth, a regular day at school, and a so-so movie: they're all unexceptional. Think about the word <i>exception</i> — something that stands out or breaks a rule. So something that's exceptional is special in some way. Adding the prefix <i>un-</i> makes an adjective that describes something that's not special, like an unexceptional bus ride to school.</p></div></div>`;
