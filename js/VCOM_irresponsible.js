You can't really rely on <i>irresponsible</i> people.</p><p class="long">Being irresponsible is the opposite of being responsible and careful â€” you do what you like and don't care what happens afterward. Forgetting to feed your dog for a week is irresponsible. Splashing around in a mud puddle in your new white pants is irresponsible. Drug use and unsafe sex are irresponsible. When the government runs up a huge deficit, many people think that's irresponsible. If you have to work with someone irresponsible, good luck: you're going to need it.</p></div>`;
