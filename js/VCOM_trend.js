While a <i>trend</i> usually refers to a certain style in fashion or entertainment, there could be a trend toward warmer temperatures (if people are following trends associated with global warming).</p><p class="long">A <i>trend</i> simply reflects what seems to be going around at any given time. A <i>trend</i> can be in any area and doesn't only reflect fashion, pop culture and entertainment. There can also be a <i>trend</i> in the stock market to be bullish or bearish, depending on economic indicators, or  a political trend reflecting a nationâ€™s current mood. Some trends are fun, some fabulous, some appalling, but however long they last, you can be sure there will always be a new <i>trend</i> coming along to replace the old.</p></div>`;
