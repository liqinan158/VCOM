Usually, people who want a job have to send in applications, do interviews, and jump through lots of hoops. Appointing is different: someone with the power to appoint can usually just give you the job. In some cases, appointing isn't a sure thing and means something closer to "recommending" â€” but it still beats filling out all those applications. It takes power to appoint people, which is why world leaders are often the ones appointing.</p></div></div>`;
