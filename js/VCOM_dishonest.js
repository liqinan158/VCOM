Liars are dishonest. Criminals are dishonest. Some lawyers and politicians have a reputation for being dishonest, as do commercials that will say anything just to get you to spend your money. Besides people, certain actions are dishonest, like forging someone's signature. When you see the word <i>dishonest</i>, think "Untrustworthy!"</p></div>`;
