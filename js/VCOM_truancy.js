That meaning still holds true: if you’re accused of truancy, some may say you’re a vagabond or an idler — meaning you’re shirking your duties. <i>Truancy</i> can refer to any absence without permission, but it often refers to  being absent from school. If you stay home from school without good reason, you might be hauled into the principal’s office to explain your truancy.</p></div></div>`;
