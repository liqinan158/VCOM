In order to win an arm-wrestling match, you must <i>overpower</i> your opponent.</p><p class="long">The word <i>overpower</i> is often used in situations where great force is used or required against some person or thing. One army might overpower another, or a mugger might overpower his victim. But delicate things, like the scent of a perfume, can also overpower you, especially if they're too strong. Our emotions can also overpower us: we cheer after a home run and swoon when it's love at first sight.</p></div>`;
