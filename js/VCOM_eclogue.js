If the poem you're reading includes a conversation between shepherds, it's probably an <i>eclogue</i>.</p><p class="long">There are other types of poetry that focus on idealized rural life, including bucolics and idylls. While these terms are often used interchangeably, an eclogue is distinguished by its dramatic form, the likelihood that it includes a shepherd's monologue (or a dialogue between two of them), and usually some reference to the delightful simplicity of the country compared with the complexities of urban society and politics. The Greek root, <i>ekloge</i>, means "a selection of poems."</p></div></div>`;
