Climbing on top of the refrigerator or filling the sugar bowl with salt could both be described as <i>monkey business</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Monkey business</i> is one of those animal idioms that make a lot of sense â€” just picture a rascally monkey stealing the hat off your head and running away. The phrase first came into use around the start of the twentieth century, possibly from the earlier term <i>monkeyshines</i>, which had the same meaning. It's thought they were influenced by the increasing popularity of zoos in the United States in the late 1800's.</p></div>`;
