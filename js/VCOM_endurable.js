Standardized tests are endurable, and eating soggy, overcooked broccoli is endurable. A long ride on a stormy sea — as long as the ship doesn't capsize — is also endurable. To <i>endure</i> something is to withstand it — if it's <i>endurable</i>, it can be endured. The word is rooted in the Latin <i>indurare</i>, "to make hard or firm."</p></div></div>`;
