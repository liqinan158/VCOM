Trust us, no one believes that.</p><p class="long">If a journalist uses fabricated quotes, it means he made them up, and if a police officer uses fabricated evidence, it means she deliberately planted or falsified it. Some fabricated things are literally manufactured, like the fabricated parts used to build a car. Both senses of this adjective come from the verb <i>fabricate</i>, "construct" or "make," and share a root with <i>fabric</i> that means "fit together."</p></div></div>`;
