It's also a verb — when people <i>herd</i> animals, they try to keep them moving in the same direction.</p><p class="long">A <i>herd</i> usually refers to a group of animals with hooves, like cows or sheep (meat-eating animals like wolves cruise around in packs). On a farm, sheepdogs are in charge of herding the herd of sheep. Herds of buffalo roam the plains. It's rarely a good thing when people act like a herd, which is to do what everyone else is doing. You might want "to break away from the <i>herd</i>" if everyone is wearing pinwheel hats, for example. If you're having trouble getting people together, you might say it's like "<i>herding</i> cats." Cats never follow directions.</p></div>`;
