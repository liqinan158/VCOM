Itâ€™s named after <i>Sienna</i>, Italy, where Renaissance painters first got the earthy pigment. It ranges from the yellowish raw <i>sienna</i> like sand, or the darker brownish red of burnt <i>sienna</i>.</p><p class="long">You can draw a sienna cow with a reddish-brown crayon, or describe your grandparents' carpet as sienna. Artists also use <i>sienna</i> for the natural pigment that contains iron oxide. Sienna is yellowish-brown, and it takes on a darker, redder tint when it's heated. It's a common pigment in oil paints and has been used since the sixteenth century, when it was produced in the Italian city of <i>Sienna</i>.</p></div></div>`;
