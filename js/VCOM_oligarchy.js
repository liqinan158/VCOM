If it's a government that's run like this, it's an <i>oligarchy</i>. A country that has this form of government is an <i>oligarchy</i> too.</p><p class="long">The political term, <i>oligarchy,</i> comes to English from the Greek with its meaning intact â€” a form of government run by a small number of people such as wealthy landowners, royalty or powerful military figures. If you say that you can't fight the oligarchy, you mean the leaders of such a place. Sometimes the word refers to the few powerful people in charge of a large company or system. A financial oligarchy might try to block reform.</p></div>`;
