If you needed advice, you'd probably go to your most <i>stable</i> friend, the one least likely to act crazy or be easily upset.</p><p class="long">Whether you're talking about an object or a person, the adjective <i>stable</i> implies reliability and strength. You can describe a government as stable, or a relationship, or a desk. A completely different meaning of <i>stable</i> is the noun "building used for housing horses or other animals." Both senses of the word come from the Latin <i>stabilis</i>, "firm or steadfast."</p></div></div>`;
