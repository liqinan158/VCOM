A <i>fatality</i> is, quite simply and grimly, a human death.</p><p class="long">You will often hear <i>fatality</i> used in conjunction with the aftermath of a disaster, natural or otherwise. For example, a news broadcaster may say, "We have received reports of at least one <i>fatality</i> as a result of the storm." <i>Fatality</i> has its roots in the Latin word <i>fatalis</i>, meaning "decreed by fate." When it comes to <i>fatality</i>, being in the wrong place at the wrong time can certainly be ill-fated.</p></div>`;
