Messages are sent from your body to your brain (and back) through your <i>spinal cord</i>.</p><p class="long">The bones of your spine protect the bundle of cells and tissue that make up your spinal cord. Without a functioning spinal cord, your brain can't tell your muscles how to move â€” and your brain can't understand sensations like pain, hot, or cold either. The central nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord, both vitally important for sensing and moving through the world.</p></div>`;
