var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">attract</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>attract</i> is to exert a force that draws something in, like the way a magnet attracts a paper clip. You might know the phrase, "opposites <i>attract</i>." This means you might be drawn to a personality type that is completely unlike yours.</p><p class="long">With <i>attract</i> comes the sense that the pull you feel towards someone or something is not entirely voluntary. It's quite possible to say that you are attracted to someone, but you don't really like them. Low prices can attract buyers into a store they would not normally go into, and standing on a street corner screaming loudly will probably attract quite a bit of attention, but not the good kind.</p></div>`;
