If you fall and hit your head really hard, the doctors will check to see there's no cerebral <i>hemorrhage</i>, or bleeding in your brain.</p><p class="long"><i>Hemorrhage</i> is pronounced HEM-or-edge. Blame the Greeks for the funny spelling, because like many medical terms, this one comes from Greek roots. Besides the medical meaning, we use <i>hemorrhage</i> to mean the uncontrollable loss of other things. If sudden disaster is making you hemorrhage money, you'll have to cut back on fancy dinners and new shoes. Can I recommend frozen pizza?</p></div>`;
