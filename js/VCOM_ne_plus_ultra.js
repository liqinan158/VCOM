Making it to the summit of Mt. Everest would be a mountain climber's <i>ne plus ultra</i>.</p><p class="long">The Latin phrase <i>ne plus ultra</i> literally means "no more beyond," and it's famously said to have been inscribed on the Pillars of Hercules at either side of the Strait of Gibralter, in part as a warning to sailors not to travel beyond the edge of the known world. Today it's used to mean "perfect," or a flawless example of something. For you, the ne plus ultra of cars might be a vintage Mercedes.</p></div>`;
