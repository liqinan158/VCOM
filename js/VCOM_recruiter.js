Sometimes company <i>recruiters</i> visit college campuses to talk to interested students.</p><p class="long">A recruiter for a large company might place advertisements for job openings and interview applicants, while a military recruiter works at an office where interested enlistees can sign up to join the armed services. If you work as a recruiter for your school's French club, it's your job to make the club look exciting and fun, and to sign up new members. The origin of <i>recruiter</i> can be traced back to the Latin <i>crescere</i>, "to grow."</p></div>`;
