When you're a nervous flyer, the last thing you want to think about is <i>gremlins</i> messing with the plane's engines.</p><p class="long">The word <i>gremlin</i> first appeared in print in 1929. It emerged from the U.K.'s Royal Air Force aviator slang (possibly influenced by <i>goblin</i>), and it became especially popular during World War II. Gremlins were described as tricksters that could be blamed for engine malfunctions and other mysterious, unexplained mechanical problems. <i>Gremlin</i> was also the name of a Marvel Comics character and a 1970s AMC car, and <i>Gremlins</i> was a popular 1984 film.</p></div>`;
