If you happen to be at the <i>nexus</i> of something, you are right in the middle of it, like standing in the middle of an intersection.</p><p class="long"><i>Nexus</i> entered English during the seventeenth century from the Latin word <i>nectere</i>, meaning "to bind or tie." People tend to use this word to describe the point where different things or ideas come together or intersect. In the field of cell biology, a <i>nexus</i> refers to "a specialized area of the cell membrane involved in intercellular communication and adhesion," and implies that the <i>nexus</i> of a cell facilitates communication among the various parts and allows it to work properly.</p></div></div>`;
