Your beloved grandmother's death or your best friend moving far away can both make you feel <i>heartsick</i>.</p><p class="long">Grief and loss are connected to the adjective <i>heartsick</i>. When someone's heartsick, they're not just bummed out â€” they are grieving and mournful. You could also describe this as being heartbroken or heavy-hearted. The <i>heart</i> is important here, because of the strong emotion associated with the word. Originally, <i>heartsick</i> literally meant "ill from heart disease."</p></div>`;
