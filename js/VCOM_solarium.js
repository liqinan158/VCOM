You can also call a <i>solarium</i> a "sun room."</p><p class="long">Houses, restaurants, hospitals, and museums, among other buildings, sometimes include a solarium. This sun-filled room is similar to a porch, but instead of being open or enclosed with screens, it's lined with glass windows. Many solar-heated buildings include solariums in their design, since glass-enclosed rooms tend to stay very warm on sunny days. In Latin, <i>solarium</i> means "sundial" and also "that which is exposed to the sun."</p></div>`;
