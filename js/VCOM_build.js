When you <i>build</i> a house, you start at the very bottom, with the foundation, and work your way up.</p><p class="long">You build a birdhouse using scraps of wood, a hammer, and nails, or you can build a career as a poet by writing daily and submitting poems to literary magazines. In both examples, you're constructing something yourself using materials and hard work. Another meaning is to make stronger: "I have to <i>build</i> my endurance if I'm going to finish that marathon." The Old English root of <i>build</i>, <i>byldan</i>, specifically means "build a house," from <i>bold</i>, "house."</p></div>`;
