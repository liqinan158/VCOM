Ventilation airs out an indoor space by letting fresh air in and stale or smelly air out, and it's more effective if you open several windows on opposite sides of the house or building. A fan in the window can also aid ventilation. The root word is the Latin <i>ventulus</i>, "a breeze," which comes from <i>ventus</i>, "wind."</p></div>`;
