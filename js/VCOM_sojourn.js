If you want a fancy way to say that you took a trip to the countryside, you might talk about your country <i>sojourn</i>.</p><p class="long">The verb is originally from the Latin prefix <i>sub-</i> "under" plus <i>diurnus</i> "of a day." You might refer to your vacation as a <i>sojourn</i>, but it might make more sense if you are describing a trip to Provence rather than a trip to Disney World. Or In figurative use, <i>sojourn</i> means to delve––your math teacher may stop midway through lessons on fractions for a brief sojourn into techniques for slicing pie.</p></div>`;
