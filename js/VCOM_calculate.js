When you calculate, you either count something up or calculate on something happening. You might be able to calculate the answer to a simple equation in your head but need a calculator to figure out a more complex problem. And when someone is <i>calculating</i>, they are scheming or conniving, always figuring out the fastest way to get ahead.</p></div>`;
