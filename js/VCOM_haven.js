Then you need a <i>haven</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Haven</i> looks a lot like <i>heaven</i>, and the words have quite a bit in common. A haven isn't necessarily as wonderful as heaven is supposed to be, but it is a good place to find when you're in trouble or someone is after you. This word often appears in the phrase "<i>safe haven</i>," which is a good reminder of its meaning. A haven is a safe place, and people who are in trouble tend to seek havens.</p></div>`;
