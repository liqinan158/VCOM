A musician's <i>fame</i> might mean she wears sunglasses and a baseball cap to disguise herself when she's in public.</p><p class="long">Movie stars, rock stars, well-known public figures â€” these are all people who have achieved some amount of fame. You may have a kind of fame in a much smaller sphere: "She won every spelling bee in the state, which gave her some <i>fame</i> at her school." <i>Fame</i> is an Old French word that means "reputation or renown," from the Latin <i>fama</i>, "rumor, reputation, or renown," and also "ill-fame" or "scandal."</p></div></div>`;
