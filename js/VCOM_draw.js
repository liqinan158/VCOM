This meaning is still common today, like when you draw the curtains shut or when a horse draws a carriage through Central Park. The most common way to use the verb <i>draw</i> is to mean "produce an image using lines," which came from the idea of drawing a pen or pencil across paper. Occasionally, <i>draw</i> gets confused with <i>drawer</i>, a noun meaning "a compartment that slides out."</p></div></div>`;
