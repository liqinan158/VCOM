You can also see <i>convivial</i> in <i>convivere</i>, meaning "to carouse together." Just when it seemed all <i>convivial</i> could ever do was describe people who overindulge, a new shade of meaning emerged: loving to be around people. After all, a big part of feasting is being with people you care about.</p></div>`;
