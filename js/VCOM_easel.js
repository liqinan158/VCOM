If an art gallery displays your painting in the window on a solid gold <i>easel,</i> you’re making a splash in the art world!</p><p class="long">An easel is a tripod, with three long legs that connect together at the top and spread out wide at the floor, for stability. Artists use easels to hold the canvas or paper they’re working on — not just to display finished works of art. If you travel to a scenic overlook, you might see an artist painting the view onto a canvas, propped up on an easel. Easels can display other things, too, like letters, posters, or signs.</p></div></div>`;
