Two <i>back-to-back</i> baseball games are played in a row.</p><p class="long"><i>Back-to-back</i> has been used to describe houses that are literally back-to-back with no separation. These days, back-to-back events happen consecutively. A baseball player with back-to-back home runs hit two in a row. A President with back-to-back victories won two elections in a row. There's no separation between back-to-back things, like how if your back was pressed against someone elseâ€™s back, nothing could fit in between. Sometimes people use the term <i>back-to-back-to-back</i> for things that happen three times in a row.</p></div></div>`;
