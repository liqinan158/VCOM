It's incredibly tempting when you're little to <i>peek</i> at your birthday presents, but you soon learn how disappointing it is to spoil the surprise.</p><p class="long">A sneaky look at something is a peek. You might peek at someone if you're shy or you don't want them to catch you looking. You can also describe a glance at a part of something as "a <i>peek</i>" â€” like when you take a peek at a napping child. <i>Peek</i> comes from <i>piken</i>, a 14th century word meaning "look quickly and slyly." Until the 15th century, the word <i>peek</i> was used interchangeably with <i>keek</i> and <i>peep</i>.</p></div>`;
