During a weather emergency, like a hurricane, local TV stations usually <i>rebroadcast</i> news reports throughout the day.</p><p class="long">Use <i>rebroadcast</i> as a verb, meaning "play again," or a noun, for the actual show or program. You might miss an exciting basketball game, but you'll probably be able to watch a rebroadcast the next day. The word <i>rebroadcast</i> combines the "again" prefix <i>re-</i> and <i>broadcast</i>, which started out with a very different definition â€” it meant "spread seeds." The modern meaning dates from the 1920s, when it referred to radio.</p></div></div>`;
