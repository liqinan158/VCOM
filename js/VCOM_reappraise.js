An artist might be dismissed during her lifetime, but critics may <i>reappraise</i> her work years later and decide that she was a genius.</p><p class="long">You can reappraise something for monetary worth, the way an antique dealer might price a chair at $100 and then reappraise it the following year (after oak becomes much more popular), raising the price to $1000. You can also reappraise, or reevaluate, qualities like your own self-esteem or your relationship with your siblings. When you <i>appraise</i>, you "set a value on" something. Add the "again" prefix <i>re-</i>, and you do it again.</p></div></div>`;
