A scientist specializing in <i>cybernetics</i> might study human-robot interaction.</p><p class="long">The term <i>cybernetics</i> was coined in the 1940s by scientist Norbert Wiener, and he defined it as "the scientific study of control and communication in the animal and the machine." The word has come to be used in slightly different ways since then, including the study of robots, cyborgs, and prosthetics.
