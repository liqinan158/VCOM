Most <i>puffins</i> live in the northernmost parts of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.</p><p class="long">Puffins belong to the family of birds known as <i>auks</i>. While puffins' coloring, proximity to the ocean, and fondness for fish make them similar to penguins, the two birds have some major differences. Penguins, which don't fly, have heavy bones that help them swim. Puffins, on the other hand, have hollow bones that assist them in soaring through the air. And while penguins live in the Southern Hemisphere, puffins are only found in the Northern Hemisphere.</p></div></div>`;
