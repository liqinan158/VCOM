Riding your skateboard down the street in your neighborhood is probably <i>licit</i>, but riding it down the subway escalator probably isn't.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>licit</i> isn't as common as its opposite, <i>illicit</i>, or "forbidden" â€” although the two words are often used together, as when someone talks about or compares licit versus illicit drugs or licit versus illicit actions. In Latin, the root <i>licitus</i> means "lawful," and it's closely related to <i>license</i>, which means "permission or freedom to do something."</p></div></div>`;
