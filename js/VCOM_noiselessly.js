Watch ballet on TV and you might think the dancers land noiselessly on the stage, but if you're sitting in the front row during a performance, you'll hear the thumps their feet actually make. <i>Noiselessly</i> comes from <i>noise</i>, an Old French word meaning "din, disturbance, or brawl," from the Latin <i>nausea</i>, "disgust, annoyance, or discomfort."</p></div></div>`;
