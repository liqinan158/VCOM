Your <i>understanding</i> might be that your mother will always drive you to school if you miss the bus.</p><p class="long">The sum of your knowledge of a certain topic, is your understanding of it. This can change, or deepen as you learn more. But being an understanding person doesn't take a lot of studying — it takes opening your heart to appreciate what someone else feels or experiences. If someone says to you, "I thought we had an understanding," you must have done something unexpected. Here, <i>understanding</i> means "an agreement."</p></div></div>`;
