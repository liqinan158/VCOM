var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">vacillating</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If someone can't make up their mind, you can call that person <i>vacillating</i>. A <i>vacillating</i> student might not know whether to commit to a major in electrical engineering or in art history.</p><p class="long">The word <i>vacillating</i> comes from the Latin <i>vacillat-</i> meaning "swayed." When you're having trouble sticking to a decision, you can be described as <i>vacillating</i> â€” meaning that you are swaying between two choices.  The spelling of vacillating can be tricky to remember. But vacillating, like its definition "uncertain," has the letter <i>c</i> in it.  And to remember the two <i>l</i>s, think about the word's meaning, wavering between two choices.</p></div>`;
