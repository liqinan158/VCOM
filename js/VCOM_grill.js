Sometimes, to <i>grill</i> means to ask a person really intense questions, like when you suspect them of doing something wrong and you want to make them confess the truth.</p><p class="long">Ever seen a film where a police officer puts a bright light in a criminal’s face and screams, “Did you do it?”  That’s how you grill someone. You have to be tough on him, and not let him off the hook too easily. Being grilled means you are in the “hot seat,” and it’ll feel like you’re cooking from such a close examination.  Better to grill than be grilled, but if you get caught — think of an alibi, quick!</p></div>`;
