Although <i>talons</i> are usually associated with eagles, hawks and other birds of prey, you can also use the word to describe the flesh-tearing claws or fingernails of raptors, werewolves or even enraged preschoolers.</p><p class="long"><i>Talons</i> typically belong to predators — the word implies bloody attack. An owl uses <i>talons</i> to stab and kill its prey. A chicken, however, uses claws to pick at its feathers and scratch around in the dirt. You can also pull <i>talons</i> into the conversation to be funny or sarcastic: “Hey! Get your <i>talons</i> off that piece of cake. It’s mine.”</p></div>`;
