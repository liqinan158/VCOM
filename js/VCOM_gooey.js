Gooey candy, likewise, might taste delicious but get stuck in your teeth. The informal <i>gooey</i> is the perfect way to describe these gummy, tacky substances, and it comes from American-coined slang, from <i>goo</i>, probably a shortened form of the now-obsolete <i>burgoo</i>, meaning "thick porridge."</p></div>`;
