A nurse might worry about the rate at which a patient respires, and a biologist might discuss the way a plant respires at night, when light doesn't reach its leaves. The Latin root, <i>respirare</i>, means "breathe again" or "breathe in and out," from <i>re-</i>, "again," and <i>spirare</i>, "to breathe."</p></div></div>`;
