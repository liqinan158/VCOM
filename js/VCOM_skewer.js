You can also use a very long <i>skewer</i> to toast marshmallows over a campfire.</p><p class="long">As a verb, <i>skewer</i> means to push a skewer through food: "Would you skewer those shrimps, and toss them on the grill?" It's also an informal term meaning to criticize someone so harshly that it probably hurts them: "This opinion piece in the newspaper really skewers the President." Experts guess that <i>skewer</i> has a Scandinavian root, possibly the Old Norse <i>skifa</i>, "a cut or slice."</p></div></div>`;
