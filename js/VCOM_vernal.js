Use the adjective <i>vernal</i> to describe something that occurs in springtime or is related to springtime. You might be familiar with the vernal equinox, which indicates the beginning of spring in the Northern Hemisphere. The word <i>vernal</i> can also be used more broadly to describe something youthful or fresh — springlike.</p></div></div>`;
