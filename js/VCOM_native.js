This is where the term Native Americans comes from — they were on this land before Europeans came over. Native plants were originally in a place — they weren't transplanted. The same is true of native animals. Sometimes people born in a place are called natives, as in "You are a native of Cleveland." When you see the word <i>native</i>, think "born there."</p></div>`;
