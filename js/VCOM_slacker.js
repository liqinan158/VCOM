Slackers avoid effort of any kind, putting work off or getting someone else to do it for them. While <i>slacker</i> is commonly thought of as a word from the 1990s — there was even a movie called <i>Slackers</i> made in 1991 — it's actually been around since at least the late 1800s. In the early 20th century, Sudanese workers protested their lack of voice and power by <i>slacking</i>, or working very slowly.</p></div>`;
