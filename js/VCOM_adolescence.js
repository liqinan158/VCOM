var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">adolescence</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The period of time when you physically and emotionally transition from childhood to adulthood is called <i>adolescence</i>. Basically it's when you're old enough to want to be an adult, but young enough that no one takes you seriously!</p><p class="long">The noun <i>adolescence</i> comes from the Latin word <i>adolescere</i>, which means "to ripen" or "to grow up." So it makes sense that we use it to describe that unique age when kids start growing into something closer to grown-ups. <i>Adolescence</i> can also refer more specifically to puberty. When you were in your <i>adolescence</i>, it bothered you when your parents pried into your life. But now that your kids are adolescents, you do the same thing to them.</p></div>`;
