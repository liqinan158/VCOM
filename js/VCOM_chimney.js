It is also the name of the curvy glass flue in a hurricane lamp.</p><p class="long">Ever since the use of fire indoors, it has been important to build a chimney to allow the smoke to escape. The word <i>chimney</i> comes ultimately from the Greek <i>kaminos</i>, "furnace," and in 13th-century Old French it became the more familiar looking <i>cheminee</i>, "fire place." As chimney fires became a serious problem, the chimney sweep became an important person, cleaning the soot from chimneys. Oh, and dancing on the rooftops. (Or not.)</p></div></div>`;
