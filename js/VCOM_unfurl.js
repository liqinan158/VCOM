Your yoga teacher will <i>unfurl</i> her long purple mat at the beginning of class.</p><p class="long">To unfurl something is to roll it out, unwinding it the way you do with a coiled laptop charger cord. You might also unfurl a pair of socks curled around each other or the American flag you keep rolled up in a closet until the Fourth of July. <i>Unfurl</i> is a more common word than its opposite, <i>furl</i>, which means "roll or fold." The French origin is <i>ferler</i>, "to furl," from the Old French roots <i>fer</i>, "firm" and <i>lier</i>, "bind."</p></div></div>`;
