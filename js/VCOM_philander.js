If you <i>philander</i>, you don't have one steady, serious relationship, but instead dabble in many casual ones.</p><p class="long">It's most common to say that a man philanders when he is excessively flirtatious or cheats on his partner with many other people. The word has both a sense of sneakiness and lightheartedness, and it comes from the now-obsolete noun <i>philander</i>, "husband" or "lover." The name <i>Philander</i>, in fact, was popular in 18th century literature for the character of a lover, from the Greek word <i>philandros</i>, "with love for the people."</p></div></div>`;
