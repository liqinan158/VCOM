var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">mentality</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>mentality</i> is a way of thinking or the ability to think and learn. If someone says you have the <i>mentality</i> of a kindergartener, that's great if youâ€™re in kindergarten, but if you're in tenth grade, they're probably calling you immature.</p><p class="long">An obvious part of the noun <i>mentality</i> is the word "mental," which means "of the mind." How your mind works is your mentality, either in a way that's measured in school or testing, or in the way you think about things. A learned way of thinking comes from experiences; for example you might have a competitive mentality at mealtime because you share a table with nine brothers and sisters.</p></div></div>`;
