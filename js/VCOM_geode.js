A geode forms when minerals settle into a hollow in the earth (like an animal burrow) or inside volcanic rock bubbles. First, a hard shell is formed, and then the minerals grow toward the center of the geode, often forming crystals in the process. The Greek root, <i>geodes</i>, means "earth-like."</p></div>`;
