The detail is depicted not by color or shades but instead by the raised design, which is called a relief. A cameo is typically used for a piece of jewelry, such as a ring or a brooch, and it has an ornate, old-fashioned quality. You may have seen this type of jewelry depicted in Victorian paintings or possibly worn by your great grandmother.</p></div>`;
