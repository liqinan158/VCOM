Or, if you're reading Victorian literature, a <i>moor</i> could be a mossy meet-up spot.</p><p class="long">This word of many hats can also be a noun — a <i>moor</i> is mossy land covered in bushes and grass. The spooky dogs in Sherlock Holmes's <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i> lurk in the moor. With a capital "M," a Moor refers to a person descended from Muslims of northwestern Africa. It's usually used as a verb, though, meaning "to fasten a boat" — probably related to the Old English word <i>mærels</i>, "mooring rope."  Say the word in a deep voice and it almost sounds like the foghorn on a ship that's about to moor in the harbor on a foggy night.</p></div></div>`;
