Looking down at the carved riverbeds in the Grand Canyon is like looking into a basket of snakes: the <i>serpentine</i> twists curve throughout the canyon floor.</p><p class="long">Not everyone likes snakes, but those who arenâ€™t grossed out by the highly flexible bodies of serpents might enjoy using the word <i>serpentine</i> for things that resemble their snaky, curvy lines. Strands of hair, cracks in dry desert, and roller-coaster rides can look serpentine, and you might tangle with a serpentine hose while minding your own business and watering the plants. Sometimes <i>serpentine</i> even describes people who are snakelike or slippery in character.</p></div></div>`;
