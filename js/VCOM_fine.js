Wine, food or porcelain that is exceptionally delicious, well-made, or beautiful is called <i>fine</i>. <i>Fine</i> also means that things are okay or acceptable, like when someone asks how you are and you reply, “I'm fine.” When you are caught doing something wrong, paying a fine, money paid as a penalty, may result.</p></div>`;
