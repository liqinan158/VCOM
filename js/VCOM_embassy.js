If you've ever visited Washington, DC, you may have seen the French embassy or the Indian embassy. These buildings often resemble homes, which makes sense because ambassadors usually live in them. The word <i>embassy</i> first meant "job or position of the ambassador," and comes from the Old French <i>ambasse</i>, with its Latin root of <i>ambactus</i>, or "servant."</p></div></div>`;
