Because it's quite expensive, <i>saffron</i> is usually sold in small quantities.</p><p class="long">Saffron looks like short, feathery threads â€” it's made from dried crocus stigmas, the thin stems at the center of the flower. A pinch of saffron, sometimes soaked in water, gives food a subtle sweet, grassy flavor and often a hint of orange or yellow color. This color itself is also called <i>saffron</i>. The word <i>saffron</i> comes from the Old French <i>safran</i>, by way of the Medieval Latin <i>safranum</i>, ultimately from the Arabic root <i>az-za'faran</i>.</p></div>`;
