When you’re falling over yourself with excitement and curiosity to see who’s coming up the red carpet next, you’re <i>agog</i> about celebrities.</p><p class="long">At Christmas time, you are probably agog to see what's in all the beautiful presents. An easy way to remember what <i>agog</i> means is to think of it as goggle-eyed, which it sounds a bit like. When you’re agog, you’re goggle-eyed with excitement about something, whatever that happens to be. In truth, the word has nothing to do with goggle-eyes, but instead relates to the Middle French word <i>en gogues</i> which means "full of mirth, good humor, and joyfulness."</p></div></div>`;
