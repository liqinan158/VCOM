An <i>indicator</i> points to, suggests, or shows something. The arrow on a street sign is an <i>indicator</i> telling you which way to go.</p><p class="long">"It's not the heat, it's the humidity!"

You might hear a lot from newscasters about "economic <i>indicators</i>." These are figures, such as the rate of unemployment or inflation, that indicate where we're headed economically.
