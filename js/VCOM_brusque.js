A <i>brusque</i> manner of speaking is unfriendly, rude, and very brief.</p><p class="long"><i>Brush</i> and <i>brusque</i> are not related, but they sound similar â€” when someone is brusque, you often feel that they are trying to give you the brush off. Near synonyms for <i>brusque</i> are <i>curt</i>, <i>short</i>, and <i>gruff</i>. <i>Brusque</i> (pronounced "brusk") was borrowed from the French word meaning "lively or fierce," from Italian <i>brusco</i>, "coarse, rough."</p></div></div>`;
