It's probably not a good idea to mail the invitations for your beach party until you've gotten official <i>approval</i> for the enormous bonfire you're planning to light.</p><p class="long">Building designs, budgets, grant applications â€” these all require official approval before they can be put into effect. You can also use the word <i>approval</i> to talk about less formal permission, like a teacher's approval of your plan to buy pizza for the whole class. <i>Approval</i> also means the belief that something is good, like your approval of your neighbor's purple house. Until 1800, it was much more common for people to use the word <i>approvance</i> to mean the same thing.</p></div>`;
