If you attend a school for social etiquette, you will learn how to <i>comport</i> yourself properly at the dinner table.</p><p class="long">You’ll usually find <i>comport</i> in one of two phrases: with yourself, himself, etc., as in, "With all that burping, you did not <i>comport yourself</i> well at Aunt Edna’s party," or with the word <i>with</i>. When you see the second version, <i>comport</i> means something more like agree. For example, you could say, "I don’t think your ripped jeans and beat up t-shirt really <i>comport</i> with the guidelines for Casual Friday."</p></div></div>`;
