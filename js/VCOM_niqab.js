Specifically, a <i>niqab</i> is worn below the eyes, covering the nose and mouth.</p><p class="long">While some observant Muslim women wear a burka, which covers the entire body, and others wear only a hijab that covers their hair and sometimes their neck, still others wear a niqab. The niqab leaves the eyes uncovered, and it's almost always worn with a separate scarf covering the hair. Women who follow this tradition wear a niqab when they are in public or in the company of men they aren't related to.</p></div>`;
