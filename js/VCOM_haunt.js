Ebenezer Scrooge was <i>haunted</i> by the Ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future.</p><p class="long">The first recorded usage of the word <i>haunt</i> is in William Shakespeare’s <i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>, a play filled with supernatural characters running around scaring the knickers off each other.  As Shakespeare knew, haunting is at its most effective in the passive voice, because there is much more drama in being haunted than haunting. Another use of the word <i>haunt</i> is as a noun, and it means "a place that is frequented often," like a popular hangout.  The gym, a bar, a corner: these are all potential haunts.  The dentist, the principal’s office, a busy intersection: these are not.</p></div></div>`;
