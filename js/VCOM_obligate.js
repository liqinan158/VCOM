You’re <i>obligated</i> to get to work on time if you want to keep your job.</p><p class="long">Obligating has to do with responsibilities. When you have a job, you're obligated to show up and do your work. You could also say the job obligates you to do these things. <i>Obligate</i>, which is about obligations (duties), can be used another way – to commit as security. Money would be obligated, or put up as security. <i>Obligate</i> is not the same thing as <i>oblige</i>, which is like doing a favor. To obligate is meaner, it means “to force.”</p></div>`;
