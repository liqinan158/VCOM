var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">monosemy</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Language scholars use the word <i>monosemy</i> for a word that has only one meaning. A word like "lucrative" (producing a profit) has only one meaning, and is therefore an example of <i>monosemy</i>. A word like "check" is a whole other story.</p><p class="long">When a word has just one meaning, it's completely clear and unambiguous. English is full instead of <i>polysemy</i>, when words have more than one meaning — like <i>book</i>, which means both "pages bound together" and "to arrest." The word <i>aunt</i>, on the other hand, only means "the sister of your mother or father," and is an example of monosemy. The Greek roots are <i>mono</i>, "one," and <i>sēma</i>, "sign."</p></div></div>`;
