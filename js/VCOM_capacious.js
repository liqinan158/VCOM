As you watch people wolf down 60 or more hot dogs in a matter of minutes, you must be thinking, "Where do they put all that food?" Well, it helps to have a capacious stomach. The suffix <i>-ous</i> adds "full of" to <i>capacity</i>; <i>capacious</i> is literally "full of capacity."  If something is <i>capacious</i>, it has plenty of extra room.</p></div>`;
