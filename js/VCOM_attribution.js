Ever wonder who said that famous quotation? Then you're curious about its <i>attribution</i>. An <i>attribution</i> identifies a source or cause of something â€” in this case, the person who first said the quote.</p><p class="long">Attribution often involves identifying the author or source of written material or a work of art. If you want to prove that painting you found in your basement is a van Gogh, you'd produce evidence to ensure proper attribution. The word can be used more generally to indicate the source of anything, whether it's a bombing, climate change, or success. For example, attribution of your success might be hard work and the support of family and friends.</p></div></div>`;
