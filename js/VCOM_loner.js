If you're a <i>loner</i>, you'd rather take a walk in the woods by yourself than go to a party.</p><p class="long">An extreme kind of loner is a hermit, a person who lives far from society, completely alone, and doesn't interact with anyone. Other loners are simply introverts, people who often need a break from socializing and enjoy spending time on their own. <i>Loner</i> seems to have appeared in the 1940s, originally in "Life" magazine's description of baseball player Ted Williams as "something of a <i>loner</i> (who) refuses to pal around with his teammates."</p></div>`;
