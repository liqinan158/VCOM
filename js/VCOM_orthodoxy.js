You could call the scientific theory of gravity an <i>orthodoxy</i>, since it's generally considered to be an established fact.</p><p class="long">The word <i>orthodoxy</i> comes from the Greek root words <i>orthos</i>, which means right, true or straight, and <i>doxa</i>, opinion. So <i>orthodoxy</i> describes the one true opinion. The noun <i>orthodoxy</i>, pronounced "OR-thuh-dock-see," is most commonly used to talk about religious beliefs. When you conform to the orthodoxy of a particular religion, you follow its accepted doctrines, like a Christian's belief in an all-powerful God.</p></div>`;
