Together they make the word <i>dyspeptos</i>, which means hard to digest or literally, badly digested. The Greek word became the root for the adjective <i>dyspeptic</i>, which in turn was the basis for <i>dyspepsia</i>. Sometimes people may say you have dyspepsia when they mean you are chronically in a bad mood or so irritable that it seems like you suffer from chronic indigestion â€” although this usage is more common with <i>dyspeptic</i>.</p></div></div>`;
