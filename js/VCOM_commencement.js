The word  can be used for the beginning of anything, from a business meeting to a vacation trip to a marriage. Anything that begins has a moment of commencement. That's why a graduation ceremony is called a <i>commencement</i> — a graduate is embarking on a new life, and the commencement ritual marks the official beginning of that life.</p></div></div>`;
