It's especially important to <i>ventilate</i> your art studio if you're using spray paint.</p><p class="long">When a doctor uses the word <i>ventilate</i>, she's usually talking specifically about air moving through a patient's lungs: "We need to artificially ventilate him until his airway is clear." Otherwise, when we ventilate something, we're almost always trying to get more clean or cool air flowing in and moving around: "You need to ventilate this room better before you set up your screen printing business here." The root of <i>ventilate</i> means "blowing."</p></div>`;
