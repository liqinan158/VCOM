You could describe your purring cat rolling around in catnip as <i>rapturous</i>.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>rapturous</i> is great for describing someone who's delighted, like the rapturous excitement of a room full of teenagers at their favorite pop star's concert, or the rapturous look on a child's face when she opens her birthday present and finds exactly what she had hoped for. The root word of <i>rapturous</i> is the Latin <i>raptus</i> or "a carrying off," and until the mid-1600s, that's exactly what <i>rapture</i> was used to mean.</p></div>`;
