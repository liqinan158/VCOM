You probably have <i>twill</i> in your closet — most jeans are made from denim <i>twill</i>.</p><p class="long">Twill is often made of cotton, and the particular method used to weave it creates a durable cloth that can be used for clothes or upholstery. Your sofa may be covered in twill — one type to look for is herringbone, in which you can see a pattern of small <i>V</i>s. The word <i>twill</i> comes from the Old English <i>twili</i>, "woven with double thread," and its Latin root <i>bilix</i>, "with a double thread."</p></div>`;
