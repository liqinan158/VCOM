Rubber trees that grow in South America and India produce the majority of <i>India rubber</i>.</p><p class="long">India rubber can also be called "natural rubber," "gum rubber," or "caoutchouc," its original name. This material was first brought to the West by 18th century explorers of the Indies, who loaned the word <i>India</i> to the gummy substance, which was eventually dubbed <i>rubber</i> because of its ability to rub out pencil marks on paper. India rubber was grown commercially on plantations in South Asia by the end of the 1800s.</p></div>`;
