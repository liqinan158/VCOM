A math teacher might offer extra credit to students who correctly write out the digits of a <i>googol</i> on the blackboard.</p><p class="long">If you want to write out a googol, write the number one followed by one hundred zeros. Mathematicians sometimes use the idea of a googol to illustrate the difference between an enormous number — one that's too large to imagine — and infinity. The word <i>googol</i> was invented by the young nephew of mathematician Edward Kasner, one of the authors of the 1940 book "Mathematics and the Imagination."</p></div>`;
