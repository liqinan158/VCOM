If you open up a carpet store with one of those sky-sweeping lights, lots of balloons, and a brass band, you’re doing it with great <i>fanfare</i>.</p><p class="long">Originally <i>fanfare</i> meant a short burst of music played by trumpeters, usually when someone important entered a room. But these days we describe anything as <i>fanfare</i> that has the same feeling as a burst of trumpets. If you’re a TV executive with a new show you think is going to be a big hit, roll it out with  <i>fanfare</i>–—ad campaigns, billboards, celebrity parties!</p></div></div>`;
