Not that it will make a difference...</p><p class="long"><i>Recalcitrant</i> is from Latin <i>calcitrare</i>, meaning "to kick," so someone who is recalcitrant is kicking back against what's wanted of them. Synonyms are <i>unruly, intractable,</i> and <i>refractory,</i> all referring to what is difficult to manage or control. Writers are frequently referring to recalcitrant Democrats and Republicans, since many people are stubbornly loyal to their political parties and unwilling to change.</p></div>`;
