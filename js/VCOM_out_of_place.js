A cowboy, for example, would probably feel <i>out of place</i> at a ballroom dance competition.</p><p class="long">The common phrase <i>out of place</i> is good for describing someone or something that doesn't quite fit. It might be because it's unseemly and wrong — like wearing a terrifying zombie mask to a kindergartner's Halloween party. It might also be a more subtle sense that it's not suitable — like a modern new house that looks out of place among your neighborhood's old shingled cottages.</p></div>`;
