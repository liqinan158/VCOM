After having a tooth pulled, you might be instructed to <i>gargle</i> with saltwater.</p><p class="long">If you gargle with mouthwash, moving the minty liquid around your mouth and then spitting it out, you'll have fresh breath. Many people make a gurgling sound when they gargle. The word comes from the Middle French <i>gargouiller</i>, "to gurgle or bubble," which stems from the Old French <i>gargole</i>, meaning both "throat" and "waterspout," rooted in the Latin word for "throat," <i>gula</i>.</p></div>`;
