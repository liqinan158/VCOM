Slow down.</p><p class="long">Although <i>gluttonous</i> usually refers to the greedy consumption of food and drink, it can also be applied to overly hearty appetites of any kind, such as a "<i>gluttonous</i> love of money," or even a masochistic love of pain, as in the popular phrase "glutton for punishment." <i>Gluttonous</i> is always used critically, and in the Christian faith especially, gluttony is considered one of the seven deadly sins.</p></div>`;
