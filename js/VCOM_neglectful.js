A <i>neglectful</i> babysitter might lose track of where her charges are.</p><p class="long">A neglectful cat owner might forget to feed his pet, and a neglectful host might wander away from his party guests to check his email or read a magazine. In either case, the neglectful person is being thoughtless or inconsiderate. The verb <i>neglect</i>, "fail to properly care for," is at the root of <i>neglectful</i>, from the Latin <i>neglegere</i>, "to make light of, disregard, or not trouble oneself about," or literally "not to pick up."</p></div></div>`;
