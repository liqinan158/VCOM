The word comes from Latin <i>ab</i> "away" + <i>ducere</i> "lead." <i>Abduction</i> is also when you move your arm or leg away from your midline.</p><p class="long">"The <i>Abduction</i> from the Seraglio" is the English title of a famous Mozart opera, in which a nobleman tries to rescue his betrothed, who has been captured — abducted — by pirates and sold into a pasha's harem, or seraglio. At the end of the opera, the pasha is overwhelmed with mercy and frees everyone and sends them home. So there really isn’t an abduction from the seraglio; the pasha lets everybody go.</p></div>`;
