If your little sister has been bothering you, then goes out to play, you can expect peace for an hour, then a <i>resumption</i> of the annoyance when she returns.</p><p class="long">Like the word <i>resume</i>, <i>resumption</i> has roots in the Latin prefix <i>re-</i> meaning "again" and <i>sumere</i> meaning to "take up." Combine these two root words: "to take up again" and you get the meaning of the word. If warring nations stop fighting in an attempt to negotiate a peace settlement, you can expect a resumption of hostilities between them if the negotiations fail.</p></div></div>`;
