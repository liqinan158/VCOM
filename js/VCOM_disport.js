It comes from the French word <i>desporter</i>, which means "to carry away" or "to entertain." Think of <i>disport</i> as what kids do when they have so much fun playing that they get carried away, forgetting all about school until the bell rings. You might disport yourself by frolicking at the beach with friends and enjoying lively conversation.</p></div></div>`;
