A castle guardian might lower the <i>portcullis</i> to protect the people inside from an invading army.</p><p class="long">It was common during medieval times for castles to be protected by a portcullis or two. They could be raised and lowered as needed, sometimes in such a way that an enemy would be trapped between a first portcullis and a second. Today, you can still see a portcullis if you visit the Tower of London. The Old French root is <i>porte coleice</i>, "sliding gate," which combines <i>coleice</i>, "sliding or flowing," and <i>porte</i>, "gate or door."</p></div>`;
