A raft that's <i>adrift</i> on a river will float downstream.</p><p class="long">If a ship goes adrift, it meanders off course, simply traveling with the water rather than on a charted course. Likewise, if you feel your life has gone figuratively adrift, you may have lost track of your plans and feel like you're wandering without a purpose. The word <i>adrift</i> comes from the sense of <i>drift</i> that means "a slow movement from one place to another," from an Old Norse root word.</p></div>`;
