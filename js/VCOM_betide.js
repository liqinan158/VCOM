This word often appears with <i>woe</i> as in "Woe <i>betide</i> all who date my sister!" Which means, basically, something bad will happen to you if you date her. If you say, "What will the new day <i>betide</i>?" it means, "What will happen tomorrow?" <i>Betide</i> means about the same thing as <i>bechance</i> and <i>befall</i>. We all want good things to betide us.</p></div>`;
