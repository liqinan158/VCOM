The police may want to interview any <i>bystanders</i> who witnessed a robbery, to get a description of the robber.</p><p class="long">A bystander does exactly what the word describes: they <i>stand by</i>, watching what's happening but not participating. You'll often hear the phrase "innocent <i>bystander</i>." For example, a newspaper might report on a fight breaking out after a football game, resulting in injuries to innocent bystanders. Before this word was coined around 1610, <i>stander-by</i> was common.</p></div></div>`;
