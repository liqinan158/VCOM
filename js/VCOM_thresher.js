The mechanical <i>thresher</i> was invented in the 18th century.</p><p class="long">Threshers have simplified the work of agriculture, automating a job that humans once spent tedious hours doing. A <i>combine</i> is an even more efficient machine, combining a thresher and a harvesterâ€”it picks the grain and separates its seeds. A <i>scythe</i> is a curved knife used for hand threshing, and the <i>thresher shark</i> gets its name from a resemblance to this tool.</p></div></div>`;
