An example of <i>pleonasm</i>? "She picked up the tiny little baby kitten."</p><p class="long">The Greek root word in <i>pleonasm</i> is <i>pleonazein</i>, which describes something as more than enough. Used accidentally, a pleonasm is just long-winded wordiness, like a sentence that includes far more words than is necessary. Used on purpose, pleonasm is a tool used by writers and speakers to emphasize something or clarify an idea through repetition. This helps audiences remember main ideas as they listen or read.</p></div></div>`;
