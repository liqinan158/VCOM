Just add <i>hand</i> if you don’t want people getting it confused with <i>right</i> as in “correct.” Also, your most reliable friend is your <i>right-hand</i> woman (or man).</p><p class="long">Your car's turn signal may be on the right-hand side of the steering wheel, and your dishwasher might be on the right-hand side of your kitchen sink. In both cases, right-hand describes something located toward the right, or in the direction of your right hand. A right-hand person, on the other hand, is someone you know you can depend on. In the musical "Hamilton," George Washington asks Alexander Hamilton to be his "<i>right-hand</i> man."</p></div></div>`;
