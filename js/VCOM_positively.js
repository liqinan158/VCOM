If your back hurts, you might say, "It's <i>positively</i> killing me!" If you want to see a movie, you might say, "I absolutely, <i>positively</i> must go." Someone might ask, "Are you <i>positively</i> sure you don't want some cake?" if they can't quite believe you don't want some. People use this word to emphasize a point.</p></div></div>`;
