Okay, no one says "gird your loins" anymore (which basically means "tighten your pants"), but <i>gird</i> is still used as a verb to mean "get ready for a dangerous situation."</p><p class="long">To <i>gird</i> is to prepare for a military attack, but more loosely it refers to readying oneself for any kind of confrontation. When you gird for something, you are preparing for the worst-case scenario. <i>Gird</i> can also mean "fasten something tightly with a belt or a band" (as in "<i>gird</i> your loins"), or it can mean "to surround or encircle." A field that is girded by trees is surrounded and encircled by trees.</p></div></div>`;
