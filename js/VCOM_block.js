And if you <i>block</i> someone, you prevent them from going past by getting in the way.</p><p class="long">A sculptor might carve a bird out of a block of marble, and you might eat a whole block of chocolate after dinner. Another <i>block</i> is the row of buildings or houses between four streets: "I'm walking the dog around the <i>block</i>." When <i>block</i> is a verb it means "to obstruct," like when you block your dog from going near the cat food. All these meanings stem from the Old French root <i>bloc</i>, "block of wood."</p></div></div>`;
