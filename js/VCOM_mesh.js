A butterfly net is made of <i>mesh</i>, and so is a window screen.</p><p class="long">Some mesh is made from string or fabric, like a fishing net or a mesh sports jersey, while other mesh is metal or plastic, like a tea strainer. In either case, it's woven loosely enough that there are small holes throughout its surface. Another meaning of <i>mesh</i> is "harmonize" or "work well together." In the fourteenth century, it was spelled <i>mesche</i>, and it meant "open space in a net," from the Old English word for net, <i>max</i>.</p></div>`;
