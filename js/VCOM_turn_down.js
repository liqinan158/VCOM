You can turn down your own enthusiasm or the air conditioning blasting in your car â€” anything you want to decrease. And when someone makes an offer you have to refuse, you can also turn that down: "I'm sorry to turn down this opportunity to dress as an elf in the Christmas parade, but my pointy shoes are at the cleaners."</p></div>`;
