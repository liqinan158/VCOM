If the census taker comes to your home, she'll want to know if you are the <i>occupier</i> of the house, how many people live there with you, and so on.</p><p class="long"><i>Occupier</i> is based on <i>occupy</i>, which itself is from the Latin <i>occupare</i>, meaning to take over or possess. An <i>occupier</i> is also an army that lives and works in a conquered foreign country. After World War II, the American, British, French, and Russian armies were all <i>occupiers</i> of the German city of Berlin. Each country controlled its own areas, but eventually, the American, British, and French section became West Berlin, and the Russian section became East Berlin.</p></div></div>`;
