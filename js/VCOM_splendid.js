Then someone (probably British) might stop you to say "Wow! You look <i>splendid</i>, darling!" Thanks the person, because <i>splendid</i> means glorious, fabulous, wonderful, and/or splendiferous.</p><p class="long">Use the adjective <i>splendid</i> to describe something of the highest quality. If you're so lucky as to have someone buy you, say, a Harry Winston diamond, splendid! But <i>splendid</i> doesn't apply only to expensive items such as jewelry, clothing, or art. You can also have a splendid idea, morning walk, or encounter with an old friend. For some, using Splenda in their coffee instead of sugar is, for them, well, splendid!</p></div></div>`;
