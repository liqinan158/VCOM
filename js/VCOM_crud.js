Basically, <i>crud</i> is anything that's grimy or dirty, especially if you're not sure exactly what it is.</p><p class="long">Other ways to say <i>crud</i> include <i>gunk</i>, <i>slop</i>, or <i>muck</i>. Your mom might complain that your room is full of crud, or you might spend a summer afternoon washing crud off your car. Either way, it's generally dirty stuff, bordering on the disgusting. In the 1940's, <i>crud</i> was popular slang that meant "nonsense or rubbish." Earlier, it was Army slang for "venereal disease," or sexually transmitted disease.</p></div></div>`;
