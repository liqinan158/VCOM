It's close in meaning to <i>haughty</i> and <i>supercilious</i>, but both of those have connotations of coolness and perceived superiority that <i>arrogant</i> does not.  An aristocrat could be called all three, but a customs official or traffic cop is more likely to be called <i>arrogant</i> than the other terms.</p></div></div>`;
