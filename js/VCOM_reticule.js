Others exist, whether they can be clearly seen or not, in just about any instrument you look through, whether it's a telescope or a microscope. Another way to spell it is <i>reticle</i>, but either way it comes from the Latin word <i>reticulatus</i>, "having a net-like pattern," itself from <i>reticulum</i>, "little net."</p></div></div>`;
