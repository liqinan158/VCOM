If you work at your aunt's hardware store, she may give you ten dollars out of <i>petty cash</i> to buy all the employees donuts.</p><p class="long">Any little costs that come up, from buying stamps at the post office to tipping a delivery driver, can be covered using petty cash. In most small stores or offices, petty cash might be a hundred dollars but would rarely amount to more than that. While today we generally use <i>petty</i> to mean "unimportant" or "trivial," the phrase <i>petty cash</i> uses its original meaning, "small."</p></div></div>`;
