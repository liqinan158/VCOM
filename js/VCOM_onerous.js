But if all of your teachers do it, that makes the task of completing your homework an <i>onerous</i> one, to say the least. If something is <i>onerous</i>, it is very difficult to deal with or do.</p><p class="long">A near synonym is <i>burdensome</i>. In legal usage, <i>onerous</i> describes a contract or lease that has more obligations than advantages. <i>Onerous</i> derives from Middle English, from Old French <i>onereus</i>, from Latin <i>oner≈çsus</i>, from <i>onus</i> "burden." In English, an <i>onus</i> is a task or duty that is <i>onerous,</i> or very difficult.</p></div></div>`;
