Either way, it refers to a dislike for women or a general bias against them. A man or a woman can exhibit misogynism, though it's more commonly seen in men or in male-dominated industries or governments. The <i>mis</i> part of the word comes from the Greek <i>miso</i>, which means "hate." In <i>misogynism</i> it's added to the Greek <i>gyne</i>, "woman" or "queen," and the doctrine suffix <i>-ism</i>.</p></div>`;
