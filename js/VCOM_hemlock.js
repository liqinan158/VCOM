No matter how hungry you are when you're lost in the woods, you should never eat <i>hemlock</i>.</p><p class="long">There are actually several toxic varieties of hemlock (as well as the harmless North American hemlock tree), but the most infamous is known by the genus name <i>Conium</i>. This hemlock causes death by slowly paralyzing the body, eventually including the respiratory system, while the poisoned person's mind remains alert. The Greek philosopher Socrates was found guilty of heresy in 399 BCE and sentenced to drink hemlock-based poison.</p></div></div>`;
