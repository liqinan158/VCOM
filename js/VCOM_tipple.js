During Prohibition in the 1920s it was illegal to <i>tipple</i> but today you can <i>tipple</i> almost anywhere — as long as you are 21.</p><p class="long">As a noun, a <i>tipple</i> is an alcoholic drink. Your usual tipple may be a glass of wine with dinner, but at a summer barbecue your tipple may be beer. From <i>tipple</i> we also get the noun <i>tippler</i> — a person who drinks regularly but moderately. Experts aren't sure where the word <i>tipple</i> comes from, but it may be from a Norwegian word, <i>tipla</i>, which means to drink slowly.</p></div></div>`;
