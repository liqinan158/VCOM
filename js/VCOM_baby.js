That <i>baby</i> is so darn lovable, however, that the word is perhaps overused to describe anyone or anything you feel passionately about.</p><p class="long">Everybody loves the baby, so much so that you might call your girlfriend <i>'baby'</i> even though she's 23. If you work in construction, you might call any woman with nice legs <i>baby</i> as she walks past. You also might snidely call your little brother <i>baby</i> when he cries about getting a ball thrown in his face. When your mother has to take him to the ER for stitches after said wounding, you might defensively say "She's just babying him, he's fine."</p></div>`;
