If you're nervously waiting for an email, you might pace <i>restively</i> while you keep an eye on your laptop.</p><p class="long">The adverb <i>restively</i> is a tricky one â€” it sounds like it should mean "in a restful or peaceful way," but it's actually almost an antonym of <i>restfully</i>. If a crowd is waiting restively for a concert to start, there's a sense of impatience and frustration. <i>Restively</i> and the adjective <i>restive</i> originally described a horse that refuses to move. The meaning "unmoving" gradually changed to "unmanageable," and finally "unable to stay still, especially because of boredom or dissatisfaction."</p></div></div>`;
