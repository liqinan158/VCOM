You can wear only one <i>sock</i> if you like, but your other foot might get jealous.</p><p class="long">Some socks barely cover the foot, while others reach up over the knee. When you sock someone, it has nothing to do with footwear; you punch them. If something "knocks your <i>socks</i> off," it makes you extremely enthusiastic or excited, and if your brother tells you to "put a <i>sock</i> in it," he means "be quiet."</p></div></div>`;
