Better not leave your <i>unchained</i> bike outside of the library â€” someone might steal it!</p><p class="long">Most people think it's fine to leave your dog unchained in the back yard for a while but consider it cruel when a dog is chained outdoors all day. To be <i>chained</i> is to be secured by a chain, and when you add the prefix <i>un-</i>, "not," you get the opposite. An unchained tiger cub can happily run back to its mother, and an unchained gate can freely swing open.</p></div>`;
