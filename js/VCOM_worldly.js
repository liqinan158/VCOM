You don't have to travel the globe to be <i>worldly</i>; reading and talking about many things with knowledge and enthusiasm is <i>worldly</i> too.</p><p class="long">While <i>worldly</i> often describes individuals who are sophisticated and well-rounded in education, travel, and experiences, it's also used for people who are rooted in the world or focused on physical and material things around them, rather than on spiritual matters. An old expression in religion is "She was too heavenly minded for <i>worldly</i> good," and it describes those who think about the spiritual or supernatural so much that they aren't worldly enough to get anything done.</p></div></div>`;
