In the first, a person who is known for a certain quality, like wisdom, is said to represent that quality in a way any can understand, like a patient, generous person who is the personification of kindness. On the other hand, <i>personification</i> can give human qualities to something that isn’t human. For example, you might say, “The sea is angry,” assigning it a human emotion.</p></div>`;
