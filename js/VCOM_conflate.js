You probably wouldn't say you <i>conflated</i> the ingredients for a cake, but if you blended two different stories together to make a new one, <i>conflate</i> would work.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>conflate</i> comes to us from the Latin word <i>conflare</i>, which literally means "to blow together." So think of using this word when you want to talk about two things getting thrown together and combined. Things that have been conflated often seem mixed up or confused. In fact, this word is also now sometimes used to mean "confuse or mix up."</p></div>`;
