The earth, a basketball, and even your body have a <i>surface</i>.</p><p class="long">A <i>surface</i> is the top layer of something. The surface of the moon is rocky, with a lot of craters, while the surface of the earth has a lot of water. Sandpaper has a rough surface; a balloon has a smooth but rubbery surface. When we use the word <i>surface</i>, it usually means there is a lot of stuff underneath. That applies to our use of <i>surface</i> to mean outward mood, as in "You look happy on the <i>surface</i>, but I know you're angry on the inside."</p></div>`;
