If you live near a busy intersection with no stop signs, you might be a bit <i>apprehensive</i> about crossing the street.</p><p class="long"><i>Apprehensive</i> is from a Latin word meaning "to seize," and it originally meant "quick to seize impressions or ideas, perceptive, intelligent." Now it means "anticipating something bad, fearful of what may happen." Synonyms are <i>afraid</i>, which suggest a more immediate fear, and <i>fearful</i>, which suggests a more general temperament ("a fearful child"). You can be <i>apprehensive</i> about a situation while being an optimistic and courageous person in general.</p></div></div>`;
