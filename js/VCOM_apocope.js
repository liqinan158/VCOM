var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">apocope</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When the final section or syllable of a word is cut off, it's called an <i>apocope</i>. The word "photo" is an <i>apocope</i> of "photograph."</p><p class="long">While some apocopes appear in speech simply due to the way a person pronounces a word — saying <i>mos</i> instead of <i>most,</i> for example — most of them function more like nicknames for longer words. The now-common word <i>zoo</i> began as an apocope for <i>zoological,</i> and nearly everyone knows what you mean if you say <i>obit</i> instead of <i>obituary.</i> The word is rooted in the Greek <i>apokoptein</i>, "cutting off," from <i>apo-</i>, "away from," and <i>koptein</i>, "to cut."</p></div>`;
