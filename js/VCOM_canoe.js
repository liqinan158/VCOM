Most <i>canoes</i> are fairly light, so that one or two people can carry them easily to the water.</p><p class="long">A canoe is wide enough for one person to sit in front of another, and pointed at both ends. Paddlers sit or kneel in the canoe and push through the water with wide, usually wooden paddles to direct their path through the water. The word <i>canoe</i> comes, by way of the Spanish <i>canoa</i>, from the Haitian language known as Carib or Arawakan, <i>canaoua</i>.</p></div>`;
