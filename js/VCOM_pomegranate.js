Eating a <i>pomegranate</i> can be messy.</p><p class="long">You can probably find a pomegranate at a large grocery store in the produce section. It won't look very enticing, with its rough, leathery peel, but once you cut it open and pop out the ruby red seeds, you'll understand why it's many people's favorite fruit. The Latin root of <i>pomegranate</i> is <i>pomum granatum</i>, literally "apple with many seeds." <i>Pome</i> means "apple," and <i>granatum</i> comes from the Latin word for "seed or grain," <i>granum</i>.</p></div></div>`;
