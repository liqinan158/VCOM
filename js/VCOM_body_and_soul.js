So if you think or act body and soul, you've brought everything you have to it. If you believe in a politician body and soul, you are 100% for that politician. If you work at your job body and soul, you are doing your job wholeheartedly. Many think of marriage as giving yourself body and soul to another person.</p></div></div>`;
