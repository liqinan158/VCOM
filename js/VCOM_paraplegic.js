If you're paraplegic, you can't move your legs or anything below the waist, and you have no feeling in those areas either. People usually get this condition because of damage to the spinal cord, which could result from a disease or an accident. Paraplegics often use wheelchairs to get around. This word is similar to <i>quadriplegic</i>, referring to people who are paralyzed from the neck down.</p></div>`;
