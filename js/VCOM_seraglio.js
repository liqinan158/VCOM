In other words, a <i>seraglio</i> is a harem.</p><p class="long">Thanks to Mozart's opera "The Abduction from the <i>Seraglio</i>," this word will always retain a slot in English â€” despite its being merely an Italian loan from an originally Turkish word meaning "Muslim women's quarters." "The Heist from the Harem" might have been just as good a translation of Mozart's title, but it somehow lacks the dignity we associate with grand opera.</p></div></div>`;
