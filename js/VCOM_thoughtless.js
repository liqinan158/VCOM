Smashing your neighbor's Jack-o-lantern was a <i>thoughtless</i> impulse you immediately regretted.</p><p class="long">If you've ever said, "I didn't really think about it hurting someone's feelingsâ€”I just did it," you've acted in a thoughtless way. This adjective is always at least a little bit negative, basically the opposite of <i>thoughtful</i>. It's thoughtless to invite everyone except the new kid at school to your birthday party, and it's thoughtless to throw trash on the ground instead of in a trash can. It's always better to stop and think first!</p></div></div>`;
