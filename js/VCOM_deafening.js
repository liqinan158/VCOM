You may think you're prepared after a flash of lightning, but the <i>deafening</i> sound of thunder can still make you jump!</p><p class="long">Deafening noises are so loud that they block out all other sounds. The deafening siren from a passing ambulance easily overwhelms the quiet conversation at your breakfast table, and a deafening roar inside a music venue may make you regret your decision to see your favorite band live. While <i>deafen</i> means "make deaf," <i>deafening</i> generally means something closer to "making you temporarily unable to hear."</p></div></div>`;
