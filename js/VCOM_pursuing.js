The <i>pursuing</i> player in a game of "tag" is "it," or the one doing the chasing.</p><p class="long">During a traditional English fox hunt, the barking dogs are the pursing animals, and the foxes are the ones being hunted. And during a typical cops-and-robbers chase, the pursuing officers are the ones in the police car with the siren blaring, racing after the getaway car. <i>Pursuing</i> and its related verb <i>pursue</i> come from the Latin <i>prosequi</i>, "follow or follow after."</p></div></div>`;
