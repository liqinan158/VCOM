When you print out a photo, you can usually choose between a glossy or <i>matte</i> finish.</p><p class="long">The matte surface of your new refrigerator doesn't reflect your image the way your old shiny stainless steel one did, and your grandmother's excessive use of face powder gives her skin a matte look. Wall paint can be purchased in different finishes, ranging from matte (or flat) to glossy. The French root is <i>mat</i>, "dead, dull surface," from the Old French meaning, "dull or dejected," which may stem from the Latin <i>mattus</i>, "maudlin with drink."</p></div>`;
