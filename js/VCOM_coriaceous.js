You're not going to see it often used outside scientific contexts.</p><p class="long">To remember this word, think of <i>corrugated</i> which also describes a kind of surface roughness. Or think about how <i>courageous</i> people like sailors and mountain climbers end up with <i>coriaceous</i> or leathery skin. The word itself is a lesson in historical linguistics: <i>Coriaceous</i> is related to the Latin word <i>corium</i>, which entered English in the 1650s, and traces its history back to the Pan Indo European root <i>*(s)ker-</i>(1), which is responsible for the Sanskrit <i>krtih</i> "hide," and the Old English <i>sceran</i> "to cut, shear."</p></div>`;
