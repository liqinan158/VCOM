A major league baseball team might have to win the World Series to get <i>acclamation</i>, but a t-ball team might get <i>acclamation</i> simply for finishing an entire game.</p><p class="long">The acclamation you get on opening night might be your main incentive for acting in plays. Likewise, the acclamation they receive while campaigning is probably more attractive to some politicians than the actual work of governing. Acclamation can sometimes take the form of enthusiastic shouting, and in fact the Latin root <i>acclamationem</i> means "a shout of approval."</p></div>`;
