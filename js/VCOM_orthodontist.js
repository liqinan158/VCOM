If you go see an <i>orthodontist</i>, you could walk out with a mouth full of braces!</p><p class="long">A dentist can fill cavities and encourage you to floss, but an orthodontist can help straighten crooked teeth or misaligned jaws. The word <i>orthodontist</i> comes from the Greek word <i>orthos</i> for “straight, correct” and <i>odon</i> for "tooth." The most common thing an orthodontist does is provide braces for kids and adults. An orthodontist can help if you have a serious tooth or jaw problem or if you just want your teeth to look better.</p></div>`;
