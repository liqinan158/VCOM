The art they created is also referred to as <i>minimalist</i>. A white canvas with one black line might be a typical minimalist painting. But anyone who likes things very simple could be called a minimalist. A president who takes a hands-off approach to policy, a composer who only plays one note, a designer who puts only a bed in a bedroom: they're all minimalists.</p></div></div>`;
