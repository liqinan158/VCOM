Fossils are the preserved remains of a prehistoric creature â€” fossilization takes a very long time, so if you see a fossil, you know it's at least 10,000 years old. Originally, <i>fossil</i> was defined as "anything that's dug up," from the Latin <i>fossilis</i>, "dug up." By the 18th century, both <i>fossil</i> and <i>fossilization</i> specifically referred to "the geological remains of a plant or animal."</p></div></div>`;
