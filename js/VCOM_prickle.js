When you're climbing over your neighbor's fence to get your Frisbee back, watch out for the <i>prickles</i> on their blackberry bushes!</p><p class="long">In addition to "thorny spikes," another meaning of <i>prickle</i> is "a pricking or tingling sensation," like the prickle that runs down your back when you hear the eerie sound of a coyote howling near your campground. To prickle is to create this sensation, a feeling that, like the word itself, is a combination of <i>prick</i> and a <i>tickle</i>.</p></div></div>`;
