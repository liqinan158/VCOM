var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">bromide</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>bromide</i> is a common saying or proverb that is obvious and not that helpful, like "When life hands you lemons, make lemonade."</p><p class="long">Some people love to say things like "Follow your dreams" and "Love takes hard work." Such trite, clich√©d sayings are bromides. A bromide isn't very helpful or specific, and people tend to say them over and over again. The word <i>bromide</i> comes from the chemical compound made of the element bromine and another metal. This kind of bromide was historically used as a sedative, a medicine that dulls your senses, just as figurative bromides are boring and dull.</p></div>`;
