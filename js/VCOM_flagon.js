It’s like a giant flask with a handle and spout that you put on the table so you can share the wine with old-timey friends.</p><p class="long">A flagon is usually used for alcohol — in particular wine, but sometimes beer. It’s an old fashioned word. A flagon might be set on a table in Colonial times, but feel free to use one now. A flagon full of wine should be enough for a group of friends at dinner — it's more than a bottle. The word <i>flagon</i> is related to <i>flask</i>, which is a smaller container for carrying alcohol.</p></div></div>`;
