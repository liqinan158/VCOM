He's got a <i>jocund</i> personality, meaning he's merry and cheerful.</p><p class="long">The word <i>jocund</i> came from the influence of two Latin words, <i>jocundus</i>, which means pleasant, and <i>jocus</i>, which is just what it sounds like: a joke. Usually the word is used to describe people, but not always.  Say your family gets together every year for a big, merry barbecue â€” you could describe it as a jocund gathering, or a jocund weekend.  It's a sort of old-fashioned word, though, so use it sparingly.</p></div></div>`;
