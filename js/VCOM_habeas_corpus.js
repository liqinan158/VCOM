That can happen in totalitarian countries, but in democracies we depend on habeas corpus, which requires a judge to release someone when there's no lawful reason to imprison them. Like most legalese, <i>habeas corpus</i> is Latin, literally "You should have the person," and it means a person can’t be locked up without explanation or trial — they must be brought before a judge.</p></div>`;
