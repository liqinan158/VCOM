A <i>bay</i> window occupies a similar inlet in a room.  When you keep someone "at <i>bay</i>" you hold them off.</p><p class="long">The different meanings of <i>bay</i> come from different origins. For example, the idea of the word as a cove comes from the Latin <i>bāia</i>, while the idea of an opening is a wall is from the Latin <i>batāre</i>, meaning "gape." The word that means a dog's howl, however, comes from the Latin <i>baubari</i>, which means "to bark." Other meanings of this versatile word include a horse with reddish coloring, and a tree with leaves used to add flavor in cooking.  There's nothing quite like riding a bay along the scenic bay while listening to the hounds bay!</p></div></div>`;
