If your math teacher is <i>strict</i>, it means that she expects her rules to be followed to the letter.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>strict</i> always has to do with rules. Your strict parents enforced rules and expected you to obey them. Your cousin might be a strict vegetarian who always follows her own rules about what to eat. Strict laws demand to be followed, and a strict follower of the First Amendment supports free speech no matter what. The Latin root of <i>strict</i> is <i>strictus</i>, which means "drawn together, tight, or rigid." A rigid adherence to rules is exactly what makes someone strict.</p></div>`;
