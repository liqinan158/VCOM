The noun <i>beatitude</i> refers to a state of great joy. Being blessed, or at least feeling blessed, is often linked to <i>beatitude</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Beatitude</i> inherited its blessedness from the Latin word <i>beatus</i>, meaning both "happy" and "blessed." In the Bible, the Beatitudes are a series of eight blessings, such as "Blessed are those poor in spirit; theirs is the kingdom of heaven." And in 1958 writer Jack Kerouac coined the term "The Beat Generation" because he felt its members were seeking beatitude.</p></div></div>`;
