You might spend time and money campaigning to be school president, handing out bumper stickers and homemade cupcakes, all in vain â€” despite your hard work, you don't win the election. When you wait in vain for the phone to ring, it never does. <i>In vain</i> is modeled after the Latin <i>in vanum</i>, and it keeps the original sense of the word <i>vain</i>, "unprofitable" or "devoid of value."</p></div></div>`;
