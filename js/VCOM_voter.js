In a presidential primary, <i>voters</i> from each major party choose a candidate to run in the general election.</p><p class="long">A voter, simply put, is either someone who's eligible to vote in an election or someone who actually does vote. When a candidate addresses voters, they're speaking to a group of people, trying to convince that group to vote for them. When voters pass an ordinance or approve a school budget, that means that the majority of those who voted made those choices. The Latin root of both <i>voter</i> and <i>vote</i> is <i>vovere</i>, "to promise."</p></div>`;
