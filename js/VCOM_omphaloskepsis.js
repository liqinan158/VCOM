People use it as a way to describe someone who is so self-absorbed that he's lost all perspective.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>omphaloskepsis</i> literally means "the contemplation of one's navel," and you could use when you see a little kid who is obsessed with his belly button. More often, it describes being so wrapped up in yourself that you lose track of the world around you â€” a metaphorical navel-gazing. The Ancient Greek root words <i>omphalos</i>, "navel," and <i>skepsis</i>, "reflection," combine to make a great way of describing a tendency to be self-absorbed.</p></div>`;
