The winds of a <i>sirocco</i> sometimes reach the speed of a hurricane.</p><p class="long">You've probably heard of tornadoes, blizzards, hurricanes and maybe even tsunamis â€” but siroccos are probably less familiar. They occur when low pressure systems move across the Mediterranean Sea, pulling warm, dry air from nearby deserts northward. The resulting sirocco causes blowing dust along the coast of North Africa, storms at sea, and damp, cold weather in Europe. The Arabic root of <i>sirocco</i> is <i>sharqi</i>, "east wind."</p></div></div>`;
