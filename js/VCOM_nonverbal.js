The word <i>verbal</i> means "in the form of words," from the Latin <i>verbum</i>, "word," so anything that's <i>nonverbal</i> happens entirely without words. You can probably tell from a friend's nonverbal cues that she's uncomfortable â€” her face or body language might give her away.</p></div></div>`;
