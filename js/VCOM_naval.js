If you are interested in <i>naval</i> history, you probably enjoy seeing ships used in sea battles.</p><p class="long"><i>Naval</i> comes from the Latin word for ship, <i>navis</i>. Use the adjective <i>naval</i> whenever you're discussing a country's fleet of ships, especially ships intended for use during wartime. You might talk about a naval officer or a naval base, where ships are kept and naval personnel live. It's easy to confuse <i>naval</i> with its homophone <i>navel</i>, the belly button.</p></div>`;
