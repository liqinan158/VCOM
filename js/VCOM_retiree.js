Florida is famous for being a state where many <i>retirees</i> live. That's why Florida has so many golf courses (and nursing homes).</p><p class="long">Most retirees are 65 or older â€” they've worked their whole lives, and when they <i>retire</i>, or cease working, they're taking a well-deserved break. Many older people continue to work, instead of becoming retirees. The word <i>retiree</i> comes from <i>retire</i>, which first meant "to retreat," and later "to withdraw to a private place." The suffix <i>-ee</i> is often used in legal terms to mean "initiator of an action."</p></div></div>`;
