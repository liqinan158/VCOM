You’re also rich.</p><p class="long">Don’t confuse <i>lode</i> with <i>load</i>.  They sound exactly the same, but while <i>load</i> means a big pile of something, <i>lode</i> means that something’s original source.  It usually refers to valuable metals, but you can find a lode of anything, like the lollipop lode at a candy factory or a lode of laughter at a comedy show.  You’ll hear about the “mother <i>lode</i>,” which is a lode beyond your imagination, like "the mother <i>lode</i> of riches inside a dragon’s den."</p></div></div>`;
