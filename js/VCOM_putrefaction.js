var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">putrefaction</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If you suspect that something in your yard is in a state of <i>putrefaction</i>, there's probably something stinky and rotten out there.</p><p class="long">The relatives of this word in English all resemble it and fit neatly into one meaning category, "rotten." The mother of them all is <i>putrid</i>, from Latin <i>putris</i>, "rotten." This leads to <i>putrefy</i>, which means "make rotten," and finally <i>putrefaction</i>, the process of rotting or a state of being rotten. The ending is <i>-faction</i> rather than <i>-fication</i> on the pattern of many nouns that have Latin <i>facere</i> in their pasts: <i>benefaction</i>, <i>malefaction</i>, and <i>liquefaction</i> â€” to name a few.</p></div></div>`;
