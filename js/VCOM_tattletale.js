Your <i>tattletale</i> brother will probably tell your parents that you were actually at the movies, not the library.</p><p class="long">The word <i>tattletale</i> is mostly used in the U.S. (in Britain it's more common to use <i>telltale</i>). It comes from the verb <i>tattle</i>, "report someone's wrongdoing." In the 16th century, you'd have called a tattletale a <i>pickthank</i>. These days, you can also use words like <i>snitch</i> or <i>whistle-blower</i>.</p></div></div>`;
