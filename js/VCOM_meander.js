If you want some time to yourself after school, you might meander home, taking the time to window shop and look around.</p><p class="long"><i>Meander</i> comes from a river in modern-day Turkey, the Maiandros, which winds and wanders on its course. Today, a stream or a path meanders, as does a person who walks somewhere in a roundabout fashion. If your speech meanders, you don't keep to the point. It's hard to understand what your teacher is trying to impart if he keeps meandering off with anecdotes and digressions. Pronounce <i>meander</i> with three syllables not two â€” me-AN-der.</p></div></div>`;
