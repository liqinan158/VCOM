The male equivalent of a <i>filly</i> is a "colt."</p><p class="long">In most places, a filly is not yet four years old, although sometimes a female horse younger than five is considered a filly. Before she is a year old, a filly is also called a "foal," or a baby horse â€” and between the ages of one and two, she's also a "yearling." Around 1400, the word was spelled <i>fyly</i>, possibly from the Old Norse <i>fylja</i>, the feminine of <i>foli</i>, or "foal."</p></div>`;
