var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">accede</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If you <i>accede</i>, it means you agree with someone or give in to his or her wish.  The word is often used in a political context â€” the Queen <i>acceded</i> to the Prince's demands for more territory, a larger army, and funnier jesters.</p><p class="long"><i>Accede</i> can also be used for everyday situations.  If you accede to your mother's request that you come home before ten, it means you'll be missing that midnight movie with your friends.   <i>Accede</i> comes from the Latin <i>accedere</i>, meaning to "approach or enter upon."  It differs slightly from <i>concede</i>, which also means consent, but a more reluctant kind. If you were to concede to your mom's 10 PM curfew rather than accede to it, you'd be doing so against your will.</p></div>`;
