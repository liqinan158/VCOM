If your friend doesn't want to associate with people who have less money than she does, it's proof of her <i>snobbery</i>.</p><p class="long">Snobbery is an unattractive trait caused by a person's belief that he or she is inherently better than others. Most snobbery has to do with social class and the idea that someone who has more money or went to a fancier school is worthier than someone who doesn't have these advantages. The root of <i>snobbery</i> is <i>snob</i>, which in 1800's British slang meant "person of the lower classes," but changed over time to mean "one who despises those considered inferior."</p></div>`;
