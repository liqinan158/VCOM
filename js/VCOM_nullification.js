Counteracting the effects of a snakebite with an antidote could be described as <i>nullification</i>, for example.</p><p class="long">Use the noun <i>nullification</i> when one thing overcomes or overrides another, basically erasing the effects of the first thing. Nullification of a newly passed law would occur if the law turned out to be impossible to enforce. The word is most often used in a political sense, in fact, and was first used this way by Thomas Jefferson in 1798. The Latin root is <i>nullificationem</i>, "a making as nothing," from <i>nullus</i>, "not any."</p></div></div>`;
