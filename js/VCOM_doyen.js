He is the <i>doyen</i> because everyone else joined after he did.</p><p class="long">Generally speaking, the doyen isn't just the person who has been there the longest â€” the doyen is also an expert, perhaps in a specialized area that the others don't know as much about. A doyen is distinguished in a way that earns leadership status, as indicated by the word's origin in the Old French word <i>deien</i>, which comes from the Latin word  <i>decanus</i>, or "head of ten monks in a monastery" or "commander of ten soldiers."</p></div>`;
