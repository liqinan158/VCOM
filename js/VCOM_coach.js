In the mid-19th Century, the name was given to railway cars, and nowadays the least expensive travel class is described as "coach." It's thought that the idea of a coach as a teacher came about because of the idea that a <i>coach</i> "carries" a student to success through his or her teaching.</p></div></div>`;
