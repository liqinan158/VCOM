While <i>mohawks</i> are commonly associated with punk music fans in the 1980s, David Beckham and Mr. T have also sported this hair style.</p><p class="long">The mohawk has been around for centuries, worn by groups as varied as 600 BCE Scythian warriors and World War II American paratroopers. It's perhaps most famous for its popularity among fans of punk and hardcore music starting in the 1980s. While it's named for the Mohawk tribe of Native Americans, it more closely resembles the way the Pawnees traditionally styled their hair than the way the Mohawks did, with a square patch at the back of the head).</p></div>`;
