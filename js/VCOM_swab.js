A <i>swab</i> is a piece of absorbent material on a stick, like a mop, but it can also be small, like a cotton <i>swab</i> used for cleaning ears.</p><p class="long">As a verb, to <i>swab</i> means to use a swab. So if you're a nurse assisting a surgeon, you might swab an incision, and if you're working on crime scene, you might swab the area for clues. On land, a swab is usually a small piece of cotton, but the original meaning of the noun was "mop used on a ship," and for a while it was also a popular derogatory term for a low-ranking sailor.</p></div>`;
