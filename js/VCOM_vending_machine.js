If you get hungry in the waiting room at the hospital, you can get some pretzels from the <i>vending machine</i>.</p><p class="long">Vending machines most commonly sell food (like chips and candy) and drinks (bottled water, juice, and soda). Typically, you insert coins, a bill, or a credit card into the machine, punch some buttons, and grab your snack from the compartment into which it's dropped. Hot drink vending machines actually prepare your coffee and pour it into a cup, and around the world, you can find hot pizza, cupcakes, French fries, and even books dispensed from vending machines.</p></div></div>`;
