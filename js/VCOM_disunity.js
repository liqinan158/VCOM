var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">disunity</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Disunity</i> is a state of disagreement and conflict in a group of people. If you and your siblings are bickering loudly about who gets to sit in the front seat of the car, that's a good example of <i>disunity</i>.</p><p class="long">When people experience disunity, they just can't get along â€” in other words, they're not united. <i>Unity</i>, "the state of being one," comes from the Latin <i>unitatem</i>, "oneness, sameness, or agreement." Adding the prefix <i>dis-</i>, "not, or lack of," gives you the exact opposite. The disunity of a country can be seen in bitter political rhetoric, and your book group shows disunity when the members argue incessantly over what to read next.</p></div>`;
