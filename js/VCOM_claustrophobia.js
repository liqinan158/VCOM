If your heart races in an elevator, or you break out in a cold sweat in a walk-in closet, you might have <i>claustrophobia</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Claustrophobia</i> is made of ancient Latin words. <i> Phobia</i>  means "fear," and <i> claustro</i>  means "bolt" — the kind you put on a door. Broadly speaking, the opposite of claustrophobia is agoraphobia, which is the fear of open spaces. For fun, try adding "-phobia" to your own personal source of dread! For example, “math-phobia.”</p></div></div>`;
