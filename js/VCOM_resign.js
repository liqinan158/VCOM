You can also <i>resign</i> yourself to something inevitable, like death — meaning you just accept that it's going to happen.</p><p class="long">When people resign, they're leaving something, like a job or political office. Congressmen resign after a scandal. Coaches resign after a really terrible season. Regular folks simply resign when they're ready to go. In those cases, <i>resign</i> is a nicer way of saying <i>quit</i>. Being resigned is another sense of this word — it's a type of acceptance. If your team is losing 80-20, you might as well resign yourself to losing. That just means you aren't in denial.</p></div></div>`;
