A road trip could be an <i>escapade</i>, or a few weeks making a living as a professional gambler, or posing as your twin sister and taking a test for her in math.</p><p class="long">You'll notice the similarities between the words <i>escapade</i> and <i>escape</i>. Usually an escapade involves some form of escape. If you cut class and spend the day at the beach, that's an escapade. If you cut class to watch former figure-skating greats boogying to Broadway tunes on ice, that's an escapade at the Ice Capades.</p></div></div>`;
