Or is it that pets <i>resemble</i> their owners? Either way, it’s downright strange how they often look alike.</p><p class="long">Derived from the old French word <i>sembler,</i> “to appear,” the verb <i>resemble</i> can imply a whole spectrum of likeness. For example, you might closely resemble your schnauzer or, hopefully, only vaguely resemble each other. It’s not just about appearance, either. This concept can include all kinds of characteristics. Two companies can resemble each other and the same could be said of two philosophies.</p></div></div>`;
