Your <i>reluctance</i> to travel on an airplane would be understandable if you glimpsed the pilot and copilot wearing party hats and blowing noisemakers.</p><p class="long">If you'd rather not do something, you feel a sense of reluctance about it. You pause for a moment, maybe to consider whether you should really go through with it, or just to enjoy the last moment before it happens. The word comes from the Latin <i>reluctari</i>, or to struggle against. There's always a struggle when reluctance is present, in that you feel pressure to do something or in not agreeing right away, someone is going to be disappointed.</p></div></div>`;
