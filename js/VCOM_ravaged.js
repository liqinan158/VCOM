A terrible fire could leave behind nothing but the <i>ravaged</i> remains of your house and possessions.</p><p class="long">Use the adjective <i>ravaged</i> when you describe something that's been wrecked, especially in a violent way. War tends to leave ravaged cities behind, and even a high wind can result in a ravaged back yard, strewn with tree branches. The French root of <i>ravaged</i> is <i>ravager</i>, "lay waste or devastate," which comes from the Old French <i>ravage</i>, "destroy," or most commonly, "destroy by flood."</p></div>`;
