Then it's <i>uncombed</i>, messy, and snarled.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>uncombed</i> is mainly used to describe hair that hasn't been neatly untangled with a comb. Your dad might remind you that it's school picture day and your hair is uncombed, for example. <i>Uncombed</i> comes from the verb <i>comb</i>, which means "draw a comb through." <i>Comb</i> also has the colloquial meaning "search thoroughly"; so if the detective hasn't yet ransacked the creepy old mansion, hunting for clues, you can say it remains uncombed.</p></div>`;
