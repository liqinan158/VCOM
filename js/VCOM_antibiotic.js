If you're coughing up green stuff, the doctor might give you an <i>antibiotic</i> to fight the infection.</p><p class="long">Since the prefix <i>anti-</i> means fighting, opposing, or killing, and <i>bios</i> is the Greek word for "life," <i>antibiotic</i> literally means life-killing. But doctors prescribe them primarily to kill the bacteria responsible for infections in the body. (A virus, on the other hand, cannot be treated with an antibiotic, so doctors are always making a distinction between a virus and a bacterial infection.) You can also use <i>antibiotic</i> as an adjective. Some plants have natural antibiotic effects when eaten.</p></div>`;
