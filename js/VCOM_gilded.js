If  you've heard the expression "all that glitters is not gold," it's especially true of anything <i>gilded</i>.</p><p class="long">You might have first heard the word <i>gilded</i> in the name of a historical period in the U.S. known as The Gilded Age; the name suggests that the appearance of wealth concealed actual poverty. <i>Gilded</i> is often used to point out illusion in this way, but if no illusion is intended, it need not be a negative word. I think the gilded doves in your painting are especially lovely.</p></div></div>`;
