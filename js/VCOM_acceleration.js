When you buy a sports car, you want one that has great <i>acceleration,</i> so it can go from zero to 60 miles an hour in no time.</p><p class="long"><i>Acceleration</i> comes from the Latin word <i>accelerationem,</i> which means "a hastening." When you hasten, you hurry, so acceleration is a speeding-up. Maybe you are walking to an appointment and realize you will be late. You pick up your pace â€” that's acceleration. If the rain on a stormy day begins to come down faster, that too is acceleration. As you can see, acceleration isn't just for cars.</p></div></div>`;
