When your grandmother reaches over to <i>muss</i> your hair, she tousles it â€” you'll have to carefully comb it again before you leave for school.</p><p class="long">Falling in the mud might make you muss your new jeans, and a strong wind on a boat will muss everyone's hair. While the verb <i>muss</i> means "make untidy," it's almost always used to talk about hair, and occasionally clothing. The word <i>muss</i> has been around since the nineteenth century, and it was probably originally a variation on <i>mess</i>. A <i>muss</i> was once also a term meaning "a fight or disturbance."</p></div>`;
