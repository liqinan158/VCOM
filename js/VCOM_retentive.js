Both come from the Latin <i>retinere</i>, which means "to hold back." If you are a farmer, it's good to know how water-retentive your soil is, or how much water it can hold and store. How much information can your brain hold and store? For someone with a retentive mind or memory or eye, it's quite a lot!</p></div>`;
