The word is most often used in a legal sense. If a piece of evidence is <i>supposititious</i>, then it's basically hypothetical. It doesn't have any hard facts to back it up.</p><p class="long">As the sound of the word suggests, <i>supposititious</i> is related to the more common <i>supposition,</i> meaning something uncertain or unconfirmed. <i>Supposititious</i> also has a slightly different and less common meaning of something that has been substituted illegally for something else. If you ask for Champagne in a bar and you get a glass of sparkling white instead, that is truly one supposititious beverage.</p></div>`;
