He’s the one who was never taught to mind his manners and avoid telling vulgar jokes at the dinner table.</p><p class="long"><i>Churlish</i> has its origins in late Old English, but its modern-day meaning of “deliberately rude” developed in the 14th century. It’s a fitting adjective to describe boorish or surly behavior. It can also describe a material that is difficult to work with, such as hard wood that’s resistant to quick whittling. Our prolific pal Shakespeare coined the phrase, “as valiant as the lion, <i>churlish</i> as the bear.”</p></div></div>`;
