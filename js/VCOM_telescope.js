If you want to look at the planets, you can use a <i>telescope</i>. The higher the magnification on the <i>telescope</i>, the better your view will be.</p><p class="long">Galileo is often credited with the invention of the telescope, but this is incorrect. Although he didn't invent it, he did improve it â€” a lot. He didn't name the telescope either; Greek mathematician Giovanni Demisiani did, in 1611. <i>Telescope</i> is from the Greek roots <i>tele</i>."far," and <i>skopos</i>, "seeing;" so it literally describes what the instrument does. As a verb, <i>telescope</i> means "to become smaller through one part sliding into another," the way a portable collapsing telescope does.</p></div>`;
