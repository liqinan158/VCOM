When someone is noncompliant, they resist authority. A child refusing to do homework or chores is being noncompliant. A citizen ignoring a police officer's request is being noncompliant. An actor telling a director to get lost is being noncompliant. Sometimes it’s good to be noncompliant, like when Rosa Parks refused to move to the back of the bus.</p></div>`;
