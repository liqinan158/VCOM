It's smart to have certain amount of <i>wariness</i> when you approach a dog you don't know.</p><p class="long">Your wariness might cause you not to trust people when you first meet them — reserving judgment or waiting to see if they turn out to be reliable can both be evidence of wariness. Sometimes wariness is entirely appropriate, like when you move through a haunted house or handle a snake. The noun <i>wariness</i> comes from the adjective <i>wary</i>, or "cautious or careful," with its Old English root, <i>wær</i>, "prudent, aware, or alert."</p></div></div>`;
