As a <i>skeptic</i>, you refuse to believe your sister saw a ghost — after all, she can't prove it.</p><p class="long">Skeptics are doubters — they need to see proof before they will believe. If you're a skeptic, you're probably dubious about things like astrology and magic. Some skeptics feel the same way about religion, preferring facts that can be scientifically and historically proven. Coming from the Greek word <i>skeptikos</i>, which means "thoughtful or inquiring," it's no surprise that a skeptic is someone who asks a lot of questions — and isn't easily convinced.</p></div>`;
