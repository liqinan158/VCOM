A tumor is removed by a doctor trained in surgery, but you need a doctor trained in <i>pathology</i> to tell you if the tumor is cancer.</p><p class="long"><i>Pathology</i> derives from the Greek pathos "suffering" and <i>ology</i> "study of"––to give us "the study of disease," but often <i>pathology</i> means the disease's behavior––the cancer pathology is to take over healthy cells and grow cancerous tumors.  We also use <i>pathology</i> to describe abnormal conditions that aren’t really diseases, like the pathology of Hollywood stars who live their lives in public and become obsessed with fitness.</p></div>`;
