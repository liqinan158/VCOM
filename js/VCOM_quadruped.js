Yes, a disaster in the making, but also a bunch of <i>quadrupeds</i> — animals that walk on four feet.</p><p class="long">Cut <i>quadruped</i> in half and it makes sense: <i>quadru</i> means four, like when a woman births four babies they are called <i>quadruplets</i>. And <i>–ped</i> is for the feet: think of centipedes and millipedes, insects that have so many feet it’s disturbing. A human is a biped because they walk on two feet. If you meet a human with four feet, you could call him a <i>quadruped</i>. You could also call the circus and let them know their quadruped is loose.</p></div>`;
