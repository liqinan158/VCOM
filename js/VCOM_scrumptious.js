Can I have another slice of that <i>scrumptious</i> pie?  Please?</p><p class="long">Something scrumptious is delightfully appetizing. We usually use it to talk about delicious food, but if your little cousin is so cute you want to eat her up, then she's scrumptious too. Remember that <i>scrumptious</i> has a "p" after the "m," even though you often can't hear it when the word is spoken.  Another common mistake is to place <i>-uous</i> at the end of <i>scrumptious</i> rather than <i>-ious</i>.</p></div></div>`;
