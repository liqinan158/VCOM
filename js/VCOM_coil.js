You might see a <i>coil</i> of rope on a dock or <i>coils</i> of hair in a fancy hairdo.</p><p class="long">A snake naturally curls its body into a coil, and the end of a whip after it's been cracked tends to form a coil. To move in this way is also to <i>coil</i>, as when your cat coils around your leg or you coil a necklace around your finger. This verb form is the earliest meaning of <i>coil</i>, from the Middle French <i>coillir</i>, "to gather," with the Latin root <i>colligere</i>, "to gather together."</p></div></div>`;
