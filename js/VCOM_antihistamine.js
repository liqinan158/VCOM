If your friend's cat makes your throat itch and your eyes swell, you should probably take an <i>antihistamine</i>.</p><p class="long">Antihistamines work by suppressing the effects of <i>histamine</i> in your body â€” this is substance released by your cells when you're exposed to allergens, or things you're allergic to. It's histamine that makes you sneeze or get itchy hives, and it's antihistamine that soothes this reaction. This scientific word comes from <i>anti-</i>, "against," <i>histidine</i>, an amino acid, and <i>amine</i>, a certain kind of organic compound.</p></div></div>`;
