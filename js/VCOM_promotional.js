They're free goodies, but they're also used to advertise a certain company or product. Your promotional travel mug probably has some company slogan printed on it, for example. A rock band's promotional appearance at a music store is a quick stop meant to advertise (or <i>promote</i>) a new album or concert tour.</p></div>`;
