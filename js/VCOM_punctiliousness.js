Your tendency to arrive five minutes early, no matter what? That's your <i>punctiliousness</i> at work.</p><p class="long">The word <i>punctiliousness</i> goes back to the Italian <i>puntiglio</i>, "fine point." People who take note of life's fine points and small details, from a library book's due date to the beach rules about leashing their dog, possess the quality of punctiliousness. You could also use the words <i>fastidiousness</i> and <i>meticulousness</i> to capture this characteristic.</p></div></div>`;
