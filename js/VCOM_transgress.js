A river will <i>transgress</i> its banks as it floods, and students who cheat <i>transgress</i> school rules.</p><p class="long"><i>Transgress</i> sounds like and means nearly the same thing as <i>trespass</i>. When you transgress a rule, you're breaking it. Religions often talk about transgressing: for Christians, breaking a commandment is transgressing against God by violating his wishes. Any transgression is pushing through a boundary: like a neighbor transgressing by letting their dog into your yard: that's a physical and a legal type of transgressing. The dog got into your territory, and the owners broke a rule.</p></div>`;
