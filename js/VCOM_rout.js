var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">rout</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you think about the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat, associate a <i>rout</i> with the agonizing defeat. A <i>rout</i> is the kind of humiliating loss that makes you wish you would have been injured in the first quarter so you could have avoided the outcome.</p><p class="long">One way to remember the meaning of the word <i>rout</i> is to consider its similarity to the word <i>riot</i>, both suggesting a disastrous mess. <i>Rout</i> can be used as either a noun or a verb: "The losing team suffered during a rout while the winning team routed them!"  This word can also be used to refer to an unruly mob of people, like a disorderly rout of sports fans involved in a stampede onto the field.</p></div>`;
