Your mother may not have been trying to <i>mortify</i> you when she showed up at your senior prom with a bunch of unicorn balloons, but she did.</p><p class="long">The root of the verb <i>mortify</i> is from the Latin word <i>mors</i>, which means “death.” To mortify something used to mean to destroy its life, but now <i>mortify</i> is mostly used when you feel so ashamed or embarrassed you “want to die.” To punish yourself through deprivation from food or another desire, you can mortify that compulsion, but it’s probably best to just mortify your parents by showing up at their work place with a new mohawk.</p></div>`;
