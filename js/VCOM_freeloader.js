If you eat all of your friend's Pop-Tarts and play his video games but then refuse to help with his math homework, you're a <i>freeloader</i>.</p><p class="long">The term <i>freeloader</i> is an informal word for someone who takes advantage of generous people, who expects to get things from them for nothing. Your cousin who comes to stay at your house for weeks without chipping in for rent or groceries — or even thanking you — is a freeloader. The word dates from around 1940, combining <i>free</i> in the sense of "without cost," and <i>load</i>, "put a burden or load on."</p></div>`;
