You use a <i>caret</i> when you're editing a text, to show where something should be inserted.</p><p class="long">The word <i>caret</i> comes into English in the 17th century — from the Latin word "is lacking.” It was originally used to indicate corrections to the typesetter, and it's not surprising that the word appears when printing presses were in full swing. Don't confuse this <i>caret</i> with its homonyms — the <i>karat</i> that measures the purity of gold, or the <i>carat</i> that tells you the weight of your diamonds, or the <i>carrot</i> that's a crunchy orange vegetable.</p></div></div>`;
