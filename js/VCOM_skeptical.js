(So basically, we should stop searching for the meaning of life and just relax.) In Pyrrho's view, the true sage was someone who realized that it was impossible to be certain about anything. His followers were called <i>Skeptikoi,</i> or Skeptics; the Greek word <i>skeptikos</i> means “given to asking questions.”</p></div>`;
