If you stumble as you're carrying a cup of coffee to the table, your coffee may <i>slosh</i> over the edge of the cup.</p><p class="long">Only something that's wet can slosh â€” water might slosh around in the bottom of a leaky rowboat, and soapsuds can slosh in a bathtub when a happy kid gets in. You can slosh tea into a mug, or slosh through puddles in your rain boots. The 1800's meaning of <i>slosh</i> was "slush or sludge," and the Middle English definition was "muddy place," probably from a combination of <i>slush</i> and <i>slop</i>.</p></div></div>`;
