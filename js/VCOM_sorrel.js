If your favorite riding boots are the same color as your horse, you can describe them as <i>sorrel</i> too.</p><p class="long">The word <i>sorrel</i> is a homograph with two distinct meanings. It can mean either a reddish brown color (or a horse with that coloring) or any of various plants with sour juice. Both words came via French, and are ultimately from different Germanic roots. The color sorrel comes from <i>sor</i>, "yellowish-brown" in Middle French, while the horse of the same name might more commonly be described as "chestnut."</p></div></div>`;
