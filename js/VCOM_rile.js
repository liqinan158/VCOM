For example, a friend might <i>rile</i> you by constantly texting when you're trying to have a conversation with her. You can also <i>rile</i> water, meaning you make it muddy by stirring it up.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>rile</i> is derived from <i>roil</i>, and they basically mean the same thing. However, <i>rile</i> is more commonly used to mean "annoy" and <i>roil</i> mostly describes stirred liquid. If you rile up your sister, what you say makes gets her worked up, ready to argue with you. When a kid splashes around in the tub, the water is roiled â€” but if it gets all over the floor, his parents will be riled.</p></div>`;
