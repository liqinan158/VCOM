Ballerinas are unlikely to <i>galumph</i>.</p><p class="long">Lewis Carroll's poem <i>Jabberwocky</i> introduced many colorful words to English, including this one: "He left it dead, and with its head / He went <i>galumphing</i> back." Originally, <i>galumphing</i> had more of a sense of joy to it, but over time, this word has come to mean only heavy, labored moving. An enormous defensive lineman galumphs across the field. Elephants galumph. Someone struggling to carry bags is galumphing. This word refers to movements that are neither quick nor graceful.</p></div></div>`;
