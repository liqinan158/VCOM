You might <i>pull</i> a rolling suitcase as you run to catch your train, for example.</p><p class="long">A horse pulls a carriage, and a tow truck pulls your dead car along the highway. You can also pull the cord on the bus that signals the driver to stop, and the kid next to you might pull on your jacket to ask if he can take your seat. A magician pulls a rabbit out of a hat by grasping it and lifting, and a sad story pulls at your heart (figuratively) â€” it exerts a force on your emotions.</p></div>`;
