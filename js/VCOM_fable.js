Among the most famous fables attributed to this storyteller of ancient Greece are "The Boy Who Cried Wolf" and "The Fox and the Grapes." But like its cousins <i>tale,</i> <i>myth,</i> and <i>legend,</i> the word <i>fable</i> is also used to describe a deliberate fabrication or fiction. In other words, it can be a polite way to describe a lie.</p></div></div>`;
