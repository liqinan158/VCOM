When you <i>permit</i> your brother to come into your room, you let him in.

It comes from the Latin <i>permittere</i> which means "give up, allow to pass through." You might feel like you "gave up" when you permitted your brother to enter your room. As a noun, a <i>permit</i> is a document that lets you do something â€” like when you get a driver's <i>permit</i> to learn to drive, or a gun permit to carry a gun, or even a construction permit to build an addition to your house.</p></div></div>`;
