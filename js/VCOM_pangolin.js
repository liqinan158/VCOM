Though they're endangered, <i>pangolins</i> can still be found in parts of Africa, China, southeast Asia, and India.</p><p class="long">Pangolins are distinctive for their scaly skin and the way they react to threats, by curling up in a ball. Though they appear to be covered in large scales, pangolins aren't reptiles, and in fact their skin is very different from reptilian scales; it's made of keratin, the same material that makes up our fingernails. Pangolins are sometimes described as resembling pine cones, particularly when they roll into a protective ball. The name comes from the Malay <i>peng-goling</i>, "roller."</p></div>`;
