It was a <i>fluke</i> to find that fifty dollar bill on the ground, and it made you smile for the rest of the day.</p><p class="long">The word <i>fluke</i> was first used in 1857 in reference to a lucky shot at billiards. If something good happens to you by chance when you're not expecting it, that's a fluke. The word <i>fluke</i> can also be used in a negative or insulting way. For example, if your favorite sports team loses an important game, you could complain that it was just a fluke that the other team won â€” meaning they didn't deserve to win and somehow got lucky.</p></div>`;
