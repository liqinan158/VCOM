You can thank <i>lamination</i> for protecting your school I.D. from the soda you just spilled all over it.</p><p class="long">For printers, lamination is a common technique used to protect paper documents from being stained, smudged, or torn. The process involves layers of clear, filmy plastic being permanently bonded to the original paper. Lamination is also used by car manufacturers to create windows that don't shatter easily, with the plastic sealed between two thin sheets of glass. The Latin root is <i>lamina</i>, "thin slice, leaf, or layer."</p></div></div>`;
