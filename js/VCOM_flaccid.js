Think elephant skin, soggy asparagus, and the type of feeble handshakes frowned on in job interviews.</p><p class="long">We get the word <i>flaccid</i> from the Latin <i>flaccus</i>, which meant "flabby." The meaning is pretty much the same today, though it applies to  more than physical flab. <i>Flaccid</i> pops up in conversation to describe lackluster leadership, dull conversation, and even feeble attempts at word definitions. If a politician's election campaign is flaccid, it will surprise no one that he only receives two votes â€” one from his grandmother and the other from someone who accidentally checked the wrong box on the ballot.</p></div></div>`;
