Of course Gandhi was a famous <i>peacemaker</i>, but even the volunteer on playground patrol can act as a <i>peacemaker</i> too.</p><p class="long">An individual can be a peacemaker, and there are also organizations that work as peacemakers. If two countries are engaged in a long war, for example, peacemakers might help negotiate a truce. Diplomats and mediators are peacemakers, and if you help your angry sisters come to a peaceable agreement about whose turn it is to take out the trash, you're a peacemaker too.</p></div></div>`;
