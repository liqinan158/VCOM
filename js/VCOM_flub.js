When a movie actor <i>flubs</i> his lines, the scene can be filmed again. But, if he's a stage actor, there's no way to fix the mistake.</p><p class="long">Even a star basketball player flubs an easy layup sometimes, and the very best students occasionally flub a quiz. The mistake or blunder itself can also be called a <i>flub</i>: "The concert was terrible, full of <i>flubs</i>." The word's been around since the 1920's, possibly influenced by words like "fluff" and "flop," and definitely coined in the United States.</p></div></div>`;
