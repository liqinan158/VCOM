Occasionally, a body needs to be identified by relatives, and that often happens in a morgue as well. Another word for <i>morgue</i> is <i>mortuary</i>. The word comes from the French <i>La Morgue</i>, which was one specific building in 1800s Paris. It replaced the much more blunt term "dead house."</p></div></div>`;
