If you go skiing and break your leg in several places, the ride from the slope to the hospital will be <i>excruciating</i> — unless you're unconscious, too.</p><p class="long"><i>Excruciating</i> doesn't just hurt. It feels like torture. This adjective actually comes to us from the Latin <i>excruciatus</i>, which means “to afflict, harass, vex, torment.” Extremely painful injuries are certainly excruciating, but sometimes so are tedious tasks or long waits: Watching the old lady in front of you pay for her groceries one nickel at a time can be just as excruciating as 4 broken ribs, especially if you're in a hurry.</p></div></div>`;
