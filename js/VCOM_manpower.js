How quickly you clean your house after a big party will depend on how much <i>manpower</i> you've got.</p><p class="long">The term <i>manpower</i> can mean "labor force," "workforce," "workers," or simply "people," and despite the <i>man</i>, it applies to both men and women. A large ship requires more manpower than a small sailboat, and the amount of manpower required to run Disneyland for a day is estimated to be at least 20,000 employees, most of whom aren't wearing cartoon character costumes.</p></div>`;
