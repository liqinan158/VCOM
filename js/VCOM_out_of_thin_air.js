You can use this phrase to describe a physical appearance, like how a magician makes a rabbit appear out of thin air. It can also describe ideas, thoughts, or stories. If you didn’t really see a city goat but said you did, then you pulled that story out of thin air. Another way to say this is <i>out of the blue</i>.</p></div>`;
