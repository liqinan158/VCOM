You could have a <i>fruitful</i> trip to the mall if you come home with a slew of snappy new outfits.</p><p class="long">There's a famous line from the Bible: "Be <i>fruitful</i> and multiply." That gives you a pretty good sense of the word: fruitful activity multiplies or adds to what's already there, producing more of something. A couple is fruitful if they have children: the more children, the more fruitful. An artist is fruitful if they create a lot of artwork. A business is fruitful if it creates profits and expands. Anything fruitful is productive: it grows and produces, much like a fruit tree.</p></div>`;
