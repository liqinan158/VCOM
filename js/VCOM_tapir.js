Unless you spend a lot of time in the jungle, you're most likely to see a <i>tapir</i> at the zoo.</p><p class="long">It might take you a minute to identify a tapir, even if you frequent the South American and Southeast Asian jungles where most tapirs live. These horse and zebra relatives are rare, considered endangered or vulnerable because of human activity. The most distinctive thing about tapirs is probably the flexible nose, which is much shorter than an elephant's trunk but equally useful for grabbing leaves to eat.</p></div></div>`;
