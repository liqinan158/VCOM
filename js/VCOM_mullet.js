The <i>mullet</i> is a popular men's hairstyle from the 1980s, which is short on the sides and long in the back.</p><p class="long">For seven hundred years, <i>mullet</i> has referred to a fish, but since 1994 it has taken off as a way to describe a hairstyle. For anyone who lived through the 1980s, it can be hard to believe that the word <i>mullet</i> was not circulating as a haircut descriptor during the decade when the haircuts were popular. But no reference to <i>mullet</i> as a hairstyle appeared in print before the 1994 Beastie Boys 1994 song "Mullet Head" dubbed it "a way of life."</p></div></div>`;
