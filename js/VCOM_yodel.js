The yodel is often connected with the Bavarian alps, where it has a long rural tradition, although people in parts of Central Africa have long used a yodel as a form of communication, and it's been part of US country music since the 1920s. The German root word is <i>jodeln</i>, "to utter the syllable <i>jo</i>."</p></div></div>`;
