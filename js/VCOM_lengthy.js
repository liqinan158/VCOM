Your teacher's <i>lengthy</i> lecture might extend far beyond the end of class and leave many people dozing at their desks.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>lengthy</i> is almost always used to describe a duration of time (or sometimes a long piece of writing), rather than the physical length of something. So long-lasting speeches and endless waits at the bus stop could both be called <i>lengthy</i>, but you wouldn't describe your friend's long hair that way. <i>Lengthy</i> is an 18th century American invention, also adopted by the British in the nineteenth century.</p></div></div>`;
