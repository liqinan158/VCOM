Your <i>controlled</i> laughter in math class won't get you in trouble, because it's muted and calm.</p><p class="long">Some people really blow their stacks when they get angry, while others express a controlled anger, calmly explaining their frustration. The ability to keep your emotions controlled is a useful one. A different meaning of <i>controlled</i> is "restricted by law," â€” many medications and drugs are classified as "<i>controlled</i> substances. The root of both <i>controlled</i> and <i>control</i> is the Latin <i>contrarotulus</i>, "a register, counter, or record of something."</p></div>`;
