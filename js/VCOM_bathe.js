A cat <i>bathes</i> itself by licking its fur with a rough tongue. If you're human, don't try that technique.</p><p class="long">The word <i>bathe</i> generally means to clean yourself in a tub of water â€” as opposed to <i>shower</i>, which means to wash beneath a stream of water. You can, however, use this verb to describe almost any kind of cleansing: you might bathe the scrape on a child's knee with a soapy cloth. Poetically, the sun can also bathe, or saturate, something with light. In Britain, to <i>bathe</i> also means "to swim."</p></div></div>`;
