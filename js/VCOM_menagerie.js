If you really want a backyard <i>menagerie</i> of farm animals after visiting the petting zoo, take a long sniff and remember what comes with them.</p><p class="long">Pet lovers can have a menagerie of cats, dogs, and birds or exotic animals such as snakes, ferrets, and piranhas. Zoos have animal collections like the menagerie of sea creatures in the aquarium and the swinging apes in the jungle menagerie. And a science or medical center may have a menagerie of rats for studying behavior. If you want a menagerie, an ant farm is a good one: lots of animals in a container, always working, and never stinking up the place.</p></div></div>`;
