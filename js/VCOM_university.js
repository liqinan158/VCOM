If you’re going to a <i>university</i>, you’re probably on a big campus that also offers housing for students and professors.</p><p class="long">Just like the word <i>universe</i> (“the whole world”), <i>university</i> comes from the Latin word <i>universus</i>, meaning "whole, entire." So think of a university as being sort of a world of its own — an institute of higher education where you live and study. A university generally offers advanced degrees and research opportunities in many fields. Sometimes <i>college</i> and <i>university</i> are used to mean the same thing, but colleges are typically smaller and more limited in scope than universities.</p></div>`;
