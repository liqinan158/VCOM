Some <i>floodgates</i> protect areas that are vulnerable to hurricanes or typhoons.</p><p class="long">There are many kinds of floodgates, all designed to hold water back sometimes and to let it flow at others. A figurative <i>floodgate</i> holds back strong emotion  or something equally powerful. You'll most often find this floodgate in the phrase, "Open the <i>floodgates</i>." For example, a school principal might worry that allowing one student to bring his pet rabbit to class will open the floodgates for everyone bringing animals to school.</p></div>`;
