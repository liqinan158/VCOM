You might not care if your friend fritters away her money on candy, but you may be upset if she fritters away her energy playing tetherball then tells you she's too tired to help with your dog walking business. The Latin root of this phrase, which means "breaking," is completely different from the root of the noun <i>fritter</i>, which means "frying."</p></div>`;
