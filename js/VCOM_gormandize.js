If your idea of a perfect night out is an enormous meal at a fancy restaurant, then you love to <i>gormandize</i>.</p><p class="long">Although <i>gormandize</i> comes from the Middle French word <i>gourmand</i>, it's not related to the similar-looking <i>gourmet</i>. While a gourmet is someone who enjoys fine food, a person who tends to gormandize also loves delicious fare, but puts the emphasis on quantity. So a few bites of sashimi or foie gras might make you a gourmet, but eating them until you feel sick is gormandizing.</p></div>`;
