You can try many types of <i>curry</i> in an Indian restaurant.</p><p class="long">There are different curries from different parts of Asia â€” a Thai curry, for example, might consist of shrimp and vegetables in a rich yellow sauce. When <i>curry</i> is a verb, it can mean "make <i>curry</i>," but it's more commonly "groom a horse." A <i>curry</i> comb, in fact, is specially made for this purpose. This <i>curry</i> comes from the Anglo-French <i>curreier</i>, "to comb a horse," while the dish has a Tamil root, <i>kari</i>, "sauce."</p></div>`;
