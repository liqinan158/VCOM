So, something that is difficult is not easy, like marathon running. <i>Difficult</i> can also be used to describe a situation or person that is hard to control. For example, if you babysit a difficult child, he or she might run away from you and not obey you. And you might have a difficult time agreeing to watch that child again.</p></div></div>`;
