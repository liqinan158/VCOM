You probably don’t encounter many magic spells in real life, but the word is often used figuratively to describe those times when you feel like a magical power controls your action. Of course, this word can also mean the verb "to <i>spell</i>" which refers to reciting the letters in a word, like the competitive spellers in a spelling bee.</p></div></div>`;
