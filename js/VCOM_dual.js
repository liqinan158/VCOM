If you have a <i>dual</i> major, it means you're majoring in two subjects, like astronomy and microbiology.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>dual</i> comes from the Latin <i>duo,</i> for two, and means having two parts. You can have a dual purpose, following two goals at once. To copilot an airplane, you need a cockpit with dual controls. If you're sometimes nasty and sometimes sugar sweet, people might think you have a dual personality. Don't confuse <i>dual,</i> though, with <i>duel,</i> which is a fight between two people.</p></div>`;
