A black cat passing in front of you is said to <i>augur</i> bad luck, but if you love cats you can choose to believe that it <i>augurs</i> good luck instead.</p><p class="long">In the past, when you said you would augur the future it meant you would predict it. That form of <i>augur</i> is rarely used today, but the sense of prediction — connected to an object or event — remains. Dark clouds augur a rainstorm. If you skip a dress rehearsal before opening night of a show, it won’t augur well for your performance. The Latin root stems from an ancient Roman religious official who predicted the future from omens.</p></div>`;
