If you walk into your house and <i>detect</i> the odor of burnt food, you can deduce from the evidence that you will be going out to dinner tonight!</p><p class="long">The verb <i>detect</i> comes from the Latin word <i>detegere</i>, which literally means "to uncover" â€” or more figuratively, to discover. You may detect the presence of a new dog in your house if you note a water bowl, chew toys, and grooming tools. Of course, the large woofing beast that greeted you at the door with a wagging tail might be a big clue as well.</p></div>`;
