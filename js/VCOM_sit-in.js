During the U.S. civil rights movement, lunch counter <i>sit-ins</i> were a common form of protest.</p><p class="long">The goal of a sit-in is to have specific demands met as well as to raise awareness about the issue. Most sit-ins occur in public spaces, from restaurants to small town city halls to university buildings. Sit-ins almost always get the attention of the press, the public, and the officials whose policies are being demonstrated against. While sit-in participants don't always literally sit down, they usually do â€” hence the term's name.</p></div>`;
