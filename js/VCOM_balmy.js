The adjective <i>balmy</i> is, indeed, related to the noun <i>balm</i> (as in "lip balm") and both share a wonderfully rich etymology: <i>Balm</i> made its way from Hebrew to English via Greek, Latin, and Old French. Just as the noun is used in the names of aromatic unguents and plants with healing properties, the adjective <i>balmy</i> is used to describe weather so pleasant that it's positively therapeutic.</p></div>`;
