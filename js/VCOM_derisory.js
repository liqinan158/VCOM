First, it means "ridiculously inadequate." Things in this category include derisory pay for doing a difficult job and the derisory punishment your sister gets for stealing your Halloween candy. The second meaning is "mocking or expressing contempt," basically a synonym for <i>derisive</i>. The Latin root of both words is <i>deridere</i>, "to ridicule."</p></div>`;
