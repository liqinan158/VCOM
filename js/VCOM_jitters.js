Your <i>jitters</i> might make it hard to stand calmly in front of an audience and deliver a speech.</p><p class="long"><i>Jitters</i> is an informal but useful noun that captures the fidgety, nervous feeling that everyone gets sometimes. When you have the jitters, you're so nervous you can hardly sit still. This word is one of the relatively few coined in the United States, and it's thought to be influenced by <i>chitter</i>, in dialect "tremble or shiver," from Middle English <i>chittern</i>, "to twitter or chatter."</p></div></div>`;
