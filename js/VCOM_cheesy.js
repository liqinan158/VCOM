You might hope your fake Rolex watch will impress your friends, but they're bound to see how <i>cheesy</i> it is.</p><p class="long">A really horrible motel room, with shag carpeting and strange art on the walls, can be described as cheesy, and so can a badly-written, sloppily made television movie. <i>Cheesy</i> is a great informal way to talk about shoddy or slightly unpleasant things. It comes from late 1800's United States university student slang, which also included the term <i>cheese</i>, which meant "ignorant, stupid person."</p></div></div>`;
