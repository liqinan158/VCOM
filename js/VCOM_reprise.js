If youâ€™re asked to <i>reprise</i> your role as "kid entertainer" at the annual family reunion, that means people want you to do it again this year.</p><p class="long">Early on, <i>reprise</i> was a part in a song or other musical composition that is repeated. The word still carries that meaning, but now it's more likely to be used as a verb to describe an action or part that is repeated, often a performance. For example, if you played a role in a wildly successful film that is going to have a sequel, you would reprise your role. The word comes from the French word <i>repris</i>, meaning "take back."</p></div>`;
