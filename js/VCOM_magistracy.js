In the UK and Australia, for example, a magistracy hears the majority of cases, with more serious criminal cases being heard by judges in larger courts. Both <i>magistrate</i> and <i>magistracy</i> come from a Latin word, <i>magistratus</i>, "public functionary or civil officer," which shares its root with the English word <i>master</i>.</p></div></div>`;
