If your friend has convinced you that you should do all of his laundry out of the goodness of your heart, guess what? You're a <i>patsy</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Patsy</i> has its roots in 19th-century American slang, and it still has a slangy air to it. It may have started out as a character in an old vaudeville act named Patsy, who always got the blame when things went wrong. From there a <i>patsy</i> came to mean an easy target, someone who can be suckered into doing the bidding of more strong-willed people. If you show some backbone and assert yourself, you won't get the <i>patsy</i> treatment!</p></div>`;
