If you get a bad grade on a paper for having a <i>prevalence</i> of typos, you need to proofread your work more carefully.</p><p class="long">The word <i>prevalence</i> comes from the Latin <i>praevalere</i>, meaning "condition of being widespread or general." The word is often used to describe a phenomenon that is widespread in a community, like the prevalence of a disease across a country. Prevalence is another word for "commonness." If there's a prevalence of thefts in your neighborhood, that means the likelihood of your house getting robbed is pretty high.</p></div>`;
