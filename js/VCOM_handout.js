While the word originated in the 1880s and gained popularity during the Great Depression among so-called "hobos," people who had to live entirely on the charity of others, <i>handout</i> has taken on a negative connotation in modern times. It's more often used to criticize the government or tax rates than to mean "a generous, thoughtful donation."</p></div>`;
