But say the word with a French accent, and voila!

The pate you eat is usually spelled with its French accents — <i>pâté</i> — so you know to pronounce it with the emphasis on the final syllable, <i>tay</i>. A plain old <i>pate</i> is a jokey word for the top of the head that rhymes with <i>fate</i>.</p></div></div>`;
