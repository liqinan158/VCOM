You are more likely to find King Tut in a <i>necropolis</i> than your Great Aunt Edna.</p><p class="long">Any graveyard can be called a <i>necropolis</i>, but the word is best used to describe a very large burying ground made up of tombs, or the ancient grave site of a famous or powerful historical figure. The pyramid at Giza, in Egypt, is an example of a necropolis â€” it's the tomb of an Egyptian pharaoh. In Latin, <i>necropolis</i> literally means "city of the dead," from the Greek burial site <i>Nekropolis</i>.</p></div></div>`;
