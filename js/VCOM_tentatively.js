var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">tentatively</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Tentatively</i> means hesitantly, like how you go about a delicate or dangerous situation. It also refers to uncertainty, like when you <i>tentatively</i> make plans to go to a party, even though you don't have a ride yet.</p><p class="long">It makes sense that the English adverb <i>tentatively</i> stems from the Latin <i>tentare</i> “to feel, try,” because to do something <i>tentatively</i> means to test it out. Think of how you slowly wade into a freezing cold pool. You’re moving tentatively, because you know it’s going to be a shock and you want to give your body time to adjust. The opposite of <i>tentatively</i> is <i>certainly</i>, a word that indicates no hesitation.</p></div>`;
