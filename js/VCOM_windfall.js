You just won the lottery and your <i>windfall</i> will make life very comfortable for you and your family. A <i>windfall</i> is a crazy bit of unexpected good fortune.</p><p class="long">First used in the fifteenth century, the word <i>windfall</i> originally referred to fruit that the wind blew from the trees. Like a prize was there for whomever found it â€” no need for the ladder and effort of picking it from the tall trees. The word eventually came to mean any unexpected and easily-gained good fortune, typically one involving money, such as the windfall profit from a lucky stock purchase.</p></div></div>`;
