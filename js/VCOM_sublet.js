You can also say the person <i>sublets</i> the apartment to you.</p><p class="long">As a noun, <i>sublet</i> refers both to the lease agreement and to the property itself: "I'm living in a tiny <i>sublet</i> right next to the train tracks." The formal, legal word for this is <i>sublease</i>, but it's more common for renters to use the informal <i>sublet</i> instead. Being able to sublet to another person makes it possible for a renter to leave an apartment without breaking their lease.</p></div>`;
