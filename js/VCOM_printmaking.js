In most cases, <i>printmaking</i> allows you to produce many copies of the same picture. Short on Picassos? Print some more!</p><p class="long">In some forms of printmaking, you carve a design into a wooden block, coat the block with ink, and then press it onto paper or canvas. The resulting work of art is called a print. Another type of printmaking requires special screens that have designs burned into them, creating a kind of stencil. Ink is then pushed through this screen onto paper or fabric â€” this is called screenprinting or silkscreen.</p></div>`;
