In some paintings of kelpies, they're pictured in human form but with hooves. Another kind of <i>kelpie</i> is the sheepdog breed which is associated with Australia, but which originated in Scotland and was named for the water spirit. The word comes from the Gaelic <i>colpach</i>, "steer or colt."</p></div></div>`;
