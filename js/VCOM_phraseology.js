Even if your two favorite novelists use the same basic plot, their <i>phraseology</i> will make the books feel completely different from each other.</p><p class="long">You can think of phraseology as the way a speaker or writer puts words and phrases together to form sentences. A linguist who studies phraseology is interested in expressions and idioms and in the way that different word choices can change the meaning of a phrase. <i>Phraseology</i> was coined in the 1550s from the Greek <i>phrasis</i>, "way of speaking," and it originally meant "a phrase book."</p></div></div>`;
