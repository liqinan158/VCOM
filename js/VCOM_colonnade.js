You might see a <i>colonnade</i> at the front of a museum.</p><p class="long">Ancient Greek and Roman buildings were often designed with a colonnade supporting them, and classically designed buildings still sometimes include a colonnade. Washington D.C.'s Lincoln Memorial is fronted by a colonnade, and even ordinary libraries, post offices, and museums might have them. The word was first used in the 1700s, and it comes from the French <i>colonnade</i>, with its Latin root of <i>columna</i>, or "pillar."</p></div>`;
