If you hope to become a <i>cosmologist</i> one day, you'll want to take a lot of astronomy classes in college.</p><p class="long">It's easy to confuse the words <i>cosmologist</i> and <i>cosmetologist</i>, though the jobs themselves are completely different. A cosmologist focuses her studies on the structure and history of the entire universe â€” how it formed, how it's changed, and what exists within it. A cosmetologist, on the other hand, is an expert at hair styling and applying makeup. The Greek roots of <i>cosmologist</i> are <i>kosmos</i>, "order or orderly arrangement," and <i>logia</i>, "discourse or dialog."</p></div>`;
