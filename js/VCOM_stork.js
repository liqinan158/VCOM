Real <i>storks</i> don't deliver babies; they mostly stand around in marshes all day.</p><p class="long">Myths going back to ancient European folklore describe storks delivering infants to their expectant parents. In Europe, it was considered good luck if a stork made a nest on a house, and that became a handy answer to questions about where babies come from: The stork brought it! Sometimes the common birthmarks on the backs of babies' heads are even called "stork bites."</p></div>`;
