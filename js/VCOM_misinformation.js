There's also the kind of misinformation that's deliberate, meant to hurt someone's reputation or keep secrets hidden. A government might release misinformation to hide classified details from spies, for example. When you add the "bad or wrong" prefix <i>mis-</i> to <i>information</i>, you get <i>misinformation</i>.</p></div></div>`;
