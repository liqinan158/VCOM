Psychologists sometimes kick it old school and spell it <i>extravert</i>. As a psychological term, it was borrowed from German <i>extravertiert,</i> from the prefix <i>extra-</i> "outside, beyond" plus Latin <i>vertere</i> "to turn." Thanks, Carl Jung! Its opposite is <i>introvert</i>, which means shy or turned inward.</p></div>`;
