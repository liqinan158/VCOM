To <i>infer </i> is to make a well informed guess — if you see your mom’s bag on the table, you might <i>infer</i> that she’s home.</p><p class="long">When you infer, you listen closely to someone and guess at things they mean but haven't actually said. It’s like guessing, but not making wild guesses. You're making deductions — guesses based on logic. Another kind of inferring is more scientific, like when a scientist has part of a dinosaur fossil and can infer what the rest of the dinosaur looked like. When you see the word <i>infer</i>, think "educated guess."</p></div>`;
