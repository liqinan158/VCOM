Botanists might talk about the <i>dissilience</i> of a ripe pea plant.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>dissilience</i> is rare — you're most likely to find it in a botany textbook, describing a ripe, bursting seed pod. The dissilience of some plants causes their seeds to pop out suddenly from their pods. The word's origin reflects this sense of bursting open: it comes from the Latin <i>dissilīre</i>, "to fly apart," from <i>dis-</i>, "apart," and <i>salīre</i>, "to leap or fly."</p></div>`;
