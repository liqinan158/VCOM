Your family, house, neighborhood, school, and people you hang out with make up your <i>milieu</i>. If you live in a mansion and have rich friends, youâ€™re part of the upper crust <i>milieu</i>. Go you.</p><p class="long">A <i>milieu</i> is both "surroundings" and everything that makes up the surroundings. Your milieu is your world, or the context you come from. Sometimes a milieu shapes a person, as when a "milieu of abuse and poverty," inspires someone to improve things for others. <i>Milieu</i> sounds a lot like <i>mildew</i> without the "d," but unless you grew up in a moldy bathtub, mildew probably has little to do with your milieu, or environment.</p></div>`;
