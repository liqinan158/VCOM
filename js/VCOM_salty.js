var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">salty</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Potato chips and sea captains are <i>salty</i>. <i>Salty</i> can mean literally covered in salt like those delicious chips, or just crotchety, like a foul-mouthed skipper.</p><p class="long">You can't drink sea water because it's so salty â€” but it may be hard for you to eat certain foods when they're not salty enough. Colloquially, you can use this adjective to mean "down-to-earth," "aggressive," or "exciting." So for example you could describe a movie pirate who's tough and blunt-spoken as <i>salty</i>. The "exciting or provocative" meaning dates from the 1860s, from the sense of "giving life or strong flavor."</p></div>`;
