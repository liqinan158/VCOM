Your grandmother might think you're <i>ungrateful</i> if you don't send her a handwritten thank you note for the birthday gift she gave you.</p><p class="long">You are ungrateful if you're unhappy with your neighbor's contribution to your yard sale â€” a big old television that doesn't work. Your neighbor, in turn, is ungrateful if he accepts the chocolate chip cookies you baked without even saying, "Thanks." The prefix <i>un</i> here means "not," and <i>grateful</i> comes from a now obsolete adjective, <i>grate</i>, "agreeable or thankful," from the Latin root <i>gratus</i>, "pleasing."</p></div></div>`;
