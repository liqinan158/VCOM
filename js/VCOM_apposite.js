It is <i>apposite</i> that radio stations play Christmas carols on Christmas Eve, and that your tax accountant takes vacation after April 15th. It all makes sense.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>apposite</i> is derived from the Latin terms <i>appositus</i> and <i>apponere</i>. <i>Ponere</i> means to place, and thus <i>apponere</i> is "well-placed or well-put." Don't confuse <i>apposite</i> with <i>opposite</i>; they have almost opposite meanings!</p></div></div>`;
