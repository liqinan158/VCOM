You can buy an insurance policy that is an <i>annuity</i>, or you can choose an <i>annuity</i> as one of your retirement fund options.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>annuity</i> is from the Latin word <i>annus</i>, meaning "year." Indeed, <i>annuities</i> typically pay out on a year basis, although other terms are possible. If you win a large amount of money in the lottery, you can usually choose to take a lump-sum payment or smaller payments paid every year over some term, like 20 or 25 years. Figuring out which payment plan is best for you would be a nice problem to have!</p></div></div>`;
