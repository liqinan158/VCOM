For example, a doctor might <i>amputate</i> an accident victim's badly crushed arm.</p><p class="long">No doubt you hope you'll never have to tell someone that you have to amputate, but if you do make sure you pronounce the word correctly, with the accent on the first syllable: "AM-pyo-tate." <i>Amputate</i> comes from the Latin word <i>amputat-</i>, meaning "lopped off." It can describe the removal of limbs or digits from both humans and animals.</p></div></div>`;
