People who are <i>phobic</i> have strong, irrational fears.</p><p class="long">A fear that isn't based in reality is a <i>phobia</i>, and someone who has this kind of fear is <i>phobic</i>. It's not uncommon to be phobic of heights, airplanes, snakes, or the dark. Being phobic goes beyond a dislike or mild anxiety, though â€” if you're truly phobic of something, you're sometimes unable to face it without trembling or feeling your heart race. The Greek root, <i>phobos</i>, means "fear."</p></div>`;
