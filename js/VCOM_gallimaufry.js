You might describe your family's traditional Thanksgiving meal as a <i>gallimaufry</i> of Italian, American, and Indian dishes.</p><p class="long">Any mishmash of stuff can be called a gallimaufry. You might have a gallimaufry of socks in your drawer, all different colors and sizes and patterns, or a gallimaufry of guests at your birthday party. You could criticize a writer's short story collection as a gallimaufry of pieces, all with different, mismatched moods and styles. <i>Gallimaufry</i> comes from the French <i>galimafr√©e</i>, "hash or ragout," from the Old French <i>calimafree</i>, "unappetizing stew or sauce."</p></div>`;
