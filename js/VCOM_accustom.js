If there is a new baby in your family, you will most likely become <i>accustomed</i> to changing diapers.</p><p class="long">Although the verb <i>accustom</i> looks like it should be related to the word <i>custom</i>, it actually comes through <i>costume</i>, through the Old French <i>acostumer</i>, with <i>Ã </i>, meaning "to," and <i>costume</i>, meaning "fashion or habit." Now it retains the meaning to make something a habit. You can accustom yourself to loud sirens if you live in a city or to the sound of crickets if you live in the country. Parents often cannot become accustomed to the musical taste of their kids.</p></div></div>`;
