You might try to <i>swat</i> a fly with a rolled-up magazine and then watch your cat <i>swat</i> at it with her paws.</p><p class="long">Someone who's attacked by a swarm of wasps will swat at them as they run away, and a kid who's annoyed at her sister might swat her, too. The smack itself is also called a <i>swat</i>. Experts suspect that <i>swat</i> is an alteration of the Middle English <i>swap</i>, "to strike," which mimics the sound of a sharp blow.</p></div></div>`;
