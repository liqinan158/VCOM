If you repeatedly tell your brother how important it is to be responsible, then you’re trying to <i>inculcate</i> in him a sense of responsibility.</p><p class="long">The word <i>inculcate</i> traces back to the Latin word <i>inculcare</i>, meaning “to force upon or to stamp in.” If anyone has even tried to inculcate you with something, it may seem as if something is being stamped into your brain — over and over and over. A key thing to remember about this word is repetition: something, such as a value or a belief, is instilled in the brain by the persistent restating of its importance.</p></div></div>`;
