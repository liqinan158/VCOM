When you spin a top, you watch it <i>gyrate</i>.</p><p class="long">An axis is a fixed, imaginary point or line that something rotates around â€” the Earth, famously, turns on an axis. If an object spins rapidly around this point, it gyrates. Many kinds of engines gyrate, and so do pinwheels, windmills, and gyroscopes. Even Elvis's hips were said to gyrate! The root of the verb <i>gyrate</i> is the Latin word for "circle," <i>gyrus</i>, which in turn comes from the Greek <i>gyros</i>, "circle or ring."</p></div>`;
