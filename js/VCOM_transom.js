The window above is also commonly referred to as a <i>transom</i>. In nautical terms, a <i>transom</i> is either the stern (or back) of a boat or a horizontal beam that helps support the stern. It was once common to describe an unsolicited manuscript as <i>over the transom</i>, as if a writer had tossed it over the publisher's door.</p></div>`;
