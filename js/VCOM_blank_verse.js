Most of Shakespeare’s plays are written in <i>blank verse</i>.</p><p class="long">English writers have been using blank verse since the 16th century. For example, in <i>Paradise Lost</i> Milton described the Adam and Eve story: “But suddenly with flesh fill’d up and heal’d: / The Rib he formd and fashoned with his hands.” The lines have a standard iambic rhythm to them but "heal'd" and "hands" definitely don't rhyme, so you know that's blank verse. Poets in more recent times continue to use blank verse.</p></div></div>`;
