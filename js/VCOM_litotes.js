Ever say "This dessert isn't bad" to mean "It's pretty good"? Or "Our teacher wasn't in the best mood today" to mean "He was really grouchy"? Well, those are examples of <i>litotes</i> â€” a way of saying something by saying what it's not.</p><p class="long">Beware using litotes too often, especially in written form. George Orwell, who had a lot to say about the misuses of language, once suggested that a good cure for the excessive use of the "not un-" format (a classic litotes), as in "a not unintelligent person," was to memorize the following sentence: "A not unblack dog was chasing a not unsmall rabbit across a not ungreen field." It usually does the trick.</p></div></div>`;
