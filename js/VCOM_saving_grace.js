You might say that the <i>saving grace</i> of your long, uncomfortable car trip to your grandparents' house is being able to watch movies on your laptop.</p><p class="long">The saving grace of a boring class could be the fact that your best friend sits next to you and sneaks you funny notes, and the saving grace of a badly cooked meal might be ice cream for dessert. The <i>saving grace</i> is the good thing that redeems, or saves, a negative experience. The original meaning, and one still used today, is religious: God's grace or blessing, especially when it's granted suddenly and "saves" a sinner.</p></div>`;
