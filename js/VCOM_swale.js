You might want to avoid walking through the <i>swale</i> on your road in your brand new suede shoes.</p><p class="long">An area of ground marked by raised ridges might also have swales between them. Many swales are natural land formations, but others are made on purpose to direct rainwater, manage runoff, and conserve the soil. These deliberate swales help spread rainwater across a wide section of land, rather than allowing it to flow quickly in one direction. <i>Swale</i> comes from the Scottish <i>swaill</i>, "low place," or the East Anglican <i>swale</i>, "shady place."</p></div></div>`;
