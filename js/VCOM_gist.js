var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">gist</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you need a quick summary of the essentials, rather than the whole story or a thorough explanation, you're looking for the <i>gist</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>gist</i> has had a variety of meanings in English, but most of them have become obsolete. The surviving sense of the word entered the language by way of the law: The <i>gist</i> of any legal action is the factor on which the action depends â€” that is, an alleged assault might be the <i>gist</i> of an indictment. The meaning of <i>gist</i> has evolved, though, and now it can be used to describe the core component of any matter, as in, "He watched the trailer, but he still didn't get the <i>gist</i> of the movie." Or, "She was having trouble writing a headline that conveyed the <i>gist</i> of her article."</p></div>`;
