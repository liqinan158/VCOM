If you overhear someone at work describe you as "the <i>big cheese</i>," it means that he thinks of you as the most important person in the office.</p><p class="long">You might also call someone important the <i>head honcho</i> or the <i>top dog</i>. The idiomatic phrase <i>big cheese</i> comes from a definition of <i>cheese</i> that comes from Urdu, in which <i>chiz</i> means "a thing." The British colonization of India brought English speakers and Urdu speakers together, and one result was the phrase "the real <i>chiz</i>" to mean "a big thing or event." This evolved over time into <i>big cheese</i>.</p></div></div>`;
