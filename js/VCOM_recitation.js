When you recite, or say something you've memorized, you give a recitation. This happens a lot in school and in religious traditions, but you might also hear your know-it-all friend give an impromptu recitation of a famous director's films or every Beatles song in alphabetical order. The word comes from the Latin prefix <i>re</i>, "again," and the word <i>citare</i>, "to summon." Summoning again from memory is recitation.</p></div></div>`;
