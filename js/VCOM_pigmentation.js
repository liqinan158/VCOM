The black <i>pigmentation</i> on your dog's tongue is one clue that she may be part chow chow.</p><p class="long">Use this fancy word to mean "color," especially when you're talking about plants or animals (including people). The bright green pigmentation of a tree on your block changes to deep orange by mid-October. And the pigmentation in your skin may be slightly darker than your brother's. The word <i>pigmentation</i> comes from <i>pigment</i> and the Latin <i>pingere</i>, "to color or paint," a root it shares with the English word <i>paint</i>.</p></div>`;
