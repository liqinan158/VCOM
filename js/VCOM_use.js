You can use a bike to get to school, or use up an entire tube of toothpaste in one vigorous brushing session. You might have to show Grandma how to use the 3-in-1 remote control. As a noun <i>use</i> means "purpose." As a verb, <i>use</i> means either "put to work," or "work something until there isn't anything left," unless you use your friend, meaning you exploit her.</p></div></div>`;
