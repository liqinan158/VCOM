If you were a king, you could wield great power in your kingdom â€” exerting your influence over everything from food rations to castle upkeep. As it is, though, you might just wield power over your pet goldfish. Note: <i>wield</i> follows the <i>i</i> before <i>e</i>, except after <i>c</i> spelling rule.</p></div>`;
