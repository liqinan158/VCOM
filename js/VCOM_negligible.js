The amount of interest you'll get on your savings is <i>negligible</i>, so you might as well spend your money.</p><p class="long">If you work really hard on something, but the praise you get for it is negligible, you won't try so hard next time. Besides meaning very small, <i>negligible</i> can mean unimportant or not worth paying attention to. If you get into a fender-bender, you've gotten into a car accident with negligible damage. School concert programs always offer a word of thanks to the principal and other members of the administration whose role in the concert seems to be negligible.</p></div>`;
