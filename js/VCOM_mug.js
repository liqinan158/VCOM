Informally, a mug is a face: that's why a mug shot of a prisoner is a picture of his face right after he has been arrested. When it's a verb, <i>mug</i> means "rob someone while threatening violence." This meaning came from an earlier definition, "to strike someone in the face (or the <i>mug</i>)."</p></div>`;
