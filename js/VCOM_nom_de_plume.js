You might use a <i>nom de plume</i> if your writing is so controversial that you are afraid to take credit for it.</p><p class="long">Using a nom de plume has been common throughout the history of literature. Some authors fear punishment by strict, controlling governments, while in other cases women have used masculine noms de plume during times when men have had an easier time getting published. You could also call it a pseudonym or a pen name. While the phrase <i>nom de plume</i> means "pen name" in French, it doesn't come from French speakers, but was coined in English using French words.</p></div>`;
