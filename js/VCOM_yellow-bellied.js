If you're <i>yellow-bellied</i>, you're not brave.

From there, it came to mean an insult for cowards. If you're afraid to ask someone on a date, you're yellow-bellied. If you're easily frightened or spooked, you're yellow-bellied. This is often used as an insult or challenge, like "What are you, <i>yellow-bellied</i>?!"</p></div></div>`;
