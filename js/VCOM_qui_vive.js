Your dog might believe it's her responsibility to be on the <i>qui vive</i> all day, barking at every little noise she hears.</p><p class="long">You'll almost always find this term in the phrase "on the <i>qui vive</i>." It comes from the question French guards and sentries would commonly ask visitors to a castle or fort: "Qui voulez-vous qui vive?" Literally, this means "Whom do you wish to live?" â€” in other words, "Whose side are you on?" Today, being on the qui vive means that you're on the alert, like a sentry, watchman, or guard dog.</p></div></div>`;
