And, if you're too lazy to tie your own shoes, you may prefer to wear <i>loafers</i> â€” slip-on shoes without laces.</p><p class="long">If you're a <i>loafer</i> at work, your co-workers will grow to resent you for doing nothing while they do their jobs. Loafers like to <i>loaf</i>, or "spend time in an idle, aimless way." People will call you a loafer if you spend most of your time in a reclining position, take frequent breaks for snacks and naps, or obviously avoid anything resembling hard work. This noun has been in use since the mid-1800s, but its origin isn't clear. The shoe called a <i>loafer</i> got its name because it's easily slipped on, without the work of laces and knots.</p></div>`;
