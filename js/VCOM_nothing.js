You might be hungry because you had nothing for lunch. It can also mean "not a big deal." That's why if you thank someone for doing something for you, he or she might reply, "Oh, it's nothing," to mean the effort was not at all significant. <i>Nothing</i> can also mean "emptiness" as in, "There's nothing in the trunk of my car."</p></div></div>`;
