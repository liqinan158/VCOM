Your round gold earrings, your dog's favorite tennis ball, and a grapefruit before you cut it in half can be called orbs too, because they're all spherical in shape. The Latin source, <i>orbem</i>, means "circle, disk, ring, or hoop," and is probably related to <i>orbita</i>, "wheel track or rut."</p></div></div>`;
