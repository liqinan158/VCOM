To start knitting, you need to put a <i>loop</i> of yarn on the end of one of your needles.</p><p class="long">Loops are ovals or circles and are often made from rope or other fibers, like the loop at the end of a cowboy's lasso. The verb <i>loop</i> means to form the shape of a loop in the sky; or to make a loop from string or some other material. If something "throws you for a <i>loop</i>," it catches you by surprise, and if you're "in the <i>loop</i>," you have access to information that others might not have.</p></div></div>`;
