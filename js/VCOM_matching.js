A pair of leather boots is <i>matching</i>, and if you and your sister wear <i>matching</i> outfits, they're identical.</p><p class="long">One way to use <i>matching</i> is to mean "exactly the same," so if a company donates matching funds to a charity, it gives exactly the same amount as other donors â€” it matches, or duplicates, the amount. Other matching things simply go together, or are coordinated: "The baby looked so cute in his little snowsuit and <i>matching</i> hat."</p></div></div>`;
