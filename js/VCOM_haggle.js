To <i>haggle</i> is to negotiate or argue over something, usually a price.</p><p class="long">You can haggle at a flea market or anywhere where the price of items is flexible. But <i>haggle</i> doesn’t always refer to price. You can haggle over a job, a contract, or who gets to ride in the front seat. Haggling is relatively aggressive behavior, and this word is closer in meaning to <i>wrangle</i> than it is to <i>negotiate</i>. You’ll rarely hear of anyone haggling quietly. <i>Haggle</i> implies an argument in which both parties want the best deal for themselves.</p></div></div>`;
