var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">litany</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>litany</i> is a long, repetitive list or series of grievances, like your picky brother's <i>litany</i> of complaints about dinner or the <i>litany</i> of critical comments your English teacher writes in the margins of your essay.</p><p class="long">The original meaning of <i>litany</i> is a purely religious one. During some Christian services, a member of the clergy recites a litany, a lengthy call-and-response type of prayer. The word's Greek root means "entreaty," and in this religious context, that's an entreaty to God. Its more popular, secular meaning tends to be used in a negative way, as in your grandpa's litany of aches and pains or the litany of complaints from passengers on a stalled subway car.</p></div>`;
