As someone who shows great courage and valor is referred to as a <i>hero</i>, their actions are considered to be acts of <i>heroism</i>. 19th Century lawyer Robert Green Ingersoll said it well: “When the will defies fear, when duty throws the gauntlet down to fate, when honor scorns to compromise with death — that is heroism.”</p></div>`;
