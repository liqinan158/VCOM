Your brother's jury-rigged skateboard ramp might be less successful. <i>Jury-rigged</i> was originally a nautical term â€” a <i>jury-rig</i> was a backup mast that sailors would bring on long voyages in case the original mast was damaged. Using the word <i>jury</i> to mean "temporary" or "makeshift" might be rooted in the Latin <i>adjutare</i>, "to aid or help."</p></div>`;
