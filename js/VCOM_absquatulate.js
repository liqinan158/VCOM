Why say a thief ran away with your money when it's much more fun to say he <i>absquatulated</i> with it?</p><p class="long">The word <i>absquatulate</i> came out of an odd fad in America in the 1830s for making playful words that sounded vaguely Latin. <i>Bloviate</i> ("speak pompously") and <i>discombobulate</i> ("make confused") are two other pseudo-Latin coinages from that era. <i>Absquatulate</i> takes the word <i>squat</i> and adds the prefix <i>ab-</i> "off, away" and the verb ending <i>-ulate</i> to suggest getting up and leaving quickly. It's hardly ever used nowadays, mostly showing up as an example of an absurd word.</p></div></div>`;
