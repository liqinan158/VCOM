Dogs have a particularly acute sense of <i>hearing</i>, and they can hear sounds pitched too high for humans to hear.</p><p class="long">You use your hearing when you attend a concert, listen to an audio book, or talk to a friend on the phone. Another kind of <i>hearing</i> is a legal process at which people state a case in front of a judge, so she can decide whether or not it should be presented at a trial with a jury. This kind of hearing gets its name from the idea that the court is "listening" to the evidence.</p></div>`;
