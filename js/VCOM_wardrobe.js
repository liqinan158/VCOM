If you're tired of your <i>wardrobe</i>,  it just might be time to go shopping.</p><p class="long">From the words <i>warder</i>, meaning “to protect”, and <i>robe</i>, meaning a “piece of clothing,” <i>wardrobe</i> originally meant an entire room where a person's clothing was stored. Nowadays, most people don’t have an entire room for their clothes, so the word <i>wardrobe</i> has downsized to just a large cabinet, or the clothing itself. A wardrobe can also be the costumes (or the costume department) of a theater company or  movie.</p></div></div>`;
