You might reassure your fellow French club members that plans are <i>afoot</i> for a fund raiser to support your upcoming trip to Qu√©bec.</p><p class="long">People frequently say that plans are afoot when they've started preparing for a party, an election campaign, a job hunt, or anything else that requires some planning. Plans might be afoot for your dad's surprise party, for example, or your sister's wedding. Another, less common way to use <i>afoot</i> is to mean "on foot," or "walking." You could tell your teacher that you're late to school because you missed the bus and had to travel afoot.</p></div>`;
