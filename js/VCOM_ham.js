If you order a <i>ham</i> sandwich at a deli, you'll get a pile of thinly-sliced meat between two slices of bread.</p><p class="long">Most ham is preserved in some way, either smoked or salted, and traditionally this meat comes from a hog's hind legs. For many people who celebrate Easter, ham is a typical main dish. <i>Ham</i>, defined in the 1630s as "meat from the hind leg of a pig," comes from the Old English <i>hamm</i>, "hollow or bend of the knee."  If you're a performer described as a <i>ham</i>, it means your acting is way too theatrical or exaggerated.</p></div></div>`;
