The stories about the amphisbaena are all fairly bloody, as it was born from a drop of blood that fell from Medusa's severed head and proceeded to feed not just on ants, but also on various dead bodies. The word <i>amphisbaena</i> combines two Greek roots, <i>amphis</i>, "both ways," and <i>bainein</i>, "to go."</p></div>`;
