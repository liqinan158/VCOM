Try <i>jurisprudence</i>, the study and philosophy of law. You want to study <i>jurisprudence</i>? Get ready for law school, where you’ll find even longer, more troubling words.</p><p class="long">The Latin-based word <i>jurisprudence</i> is made up of two parts, <i>juris</i> "of law" and <i>prudence</i> which goes back to mean "knowledge." If you study law, you study jurisprudence. You can modify it to show a specific type of law, so you will find terms such as medical, human rights, Islamic or American jurisprudence. Sometimes the word is used as a collective to mean the legal world. This is a new issue that jurisprudence will have to deal with.</p></div>`;
