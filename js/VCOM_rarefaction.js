As you climb a mountain, you experience <i>rarefaction</i> of the air; the air becomes less dense the higher up you go.</p><p class="long">Most of the time, <i>rarefaction</i> refers to air or other gases becoming less dense. When rarefaction occurs, the particles in a gas become more spread out. You may come across this word in the context of sound waves. A sound wave moving through air is made up of alternating areas of higher and lower density. The areas of lower density are called rarefactions.</p></div></div>`;
