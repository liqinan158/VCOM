If you put your clothes away <i>willy-nilly</i>, it'll take forever to find two matching socks.</p><p class="long">This adverb is perfect for describing something done without any planning, like when the neighborhood kids grab instruments and parade willy-nilly up and down streets and through people's backyards. <i>Willy-nilly</i> comes from the obsolete phrase <i>will I, nill I</i>, or "I am willing, I am unwilling." The original definition, "whether one likes it or not," gradually evolved into today's meaning. Along the way, variations on <i>willy-nilly</i> included "nilly-willy," "willing, nilling," and "William nilliam."</p></div></div>`;
