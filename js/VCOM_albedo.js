Snow has a high <i>albedo</i>, which is why skiers wear sunglasses and sunscreen.</p><p class="long">Technically speaking, the albedo of an object is a ratio. It compares the amount of light hitting the surface of the object to the amount of light that gets reflected back. The more light reflected, the higher the albedo. Scientists often use this word in reference to the surfaces of planets and other reflective objects in the night sky. <i>Albedo</i> comes from a Latin word for “white.”</p></div></div>`;
