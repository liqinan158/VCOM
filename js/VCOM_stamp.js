If you're terrified of bugs, you might be tempted to <i>stamp</i> on a big, weird looking beetle.</p><p class="long">You can stamp your foot when you're angry, or stamp out a small campfire after you've finished toasting marshmallows. Another way to stamp is to apply a mark or pattern to something — you might stamp your classmates' hands with ink as they enter the school dance, or stamp your return address onto an envelope. <i>Stamp</i> comes from Middle English, with a Germanic root — it's closely related to the German word <i>stampfen</i>, or "stamp with the foot."</p></div></div>`;
