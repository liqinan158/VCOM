Sleeping with your boots on is pretty normal if you're a cowboy, but leaving them on for bedtime in your city apartment, that shows some <i>eccentricity.</i></p><p class="long"><i>Eccentricity</i> goes back to the Greek <i>ekkentros,</i> meaning "off center," and when you describe people as being a little "off," you might be talking about their eccentricity or behavior that's a bit abnormal. An eccentricity might be some really small character trait, like eating all of the green food on your plate first, or a large and very obvious characteristic, as when you ride a donkey to your suburban school instead of taking the bus.</p></div></div>`;
