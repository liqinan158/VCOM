Unless you're new to the planet, you've probably noticed many things that are infuriating: people talking too loudly on their phones, the cancellation of your favorite TV show, stepping in a puddle, someone stealing from you, stubbing your toe. These annoying events could infuriate anyone. Sometimes you might infuriate someone else by accident. Like it or not, we all infuriate someone sometime.</p></div>`;
