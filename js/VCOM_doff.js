You probably always <i>doff</i> your cap before the playing of "The Star-Spangled Banner."</p><p class="long">The word <i>doff</i> and its antonym <i>don</i> date to the mid-14th century. <i>Doff</i> is a contraction of "do (take) off," and <i>don</i> is short for "do (put) on." By 1755, these words were all but obsolete, but they came back into vogue thanks to Sir Walter Scott, author of works like <i>Ivanhoe</i>, <i>Rob Roy</i>, and <i>The Lady of the Lake</i>. The popular Scottish author used them frequently, and he and his readers kept <i>doff</i> and <i>don</i> alive.</p></div></div>`;
