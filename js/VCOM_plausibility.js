You might, for example, question the <i>plausibility</i> of your brother's story about seeing a UFO land in the back yard.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>plausibility</i> means "likelihood" or "believability." You're most likely to come across the word in a negative or questioning context, as when someone doubts the plausibility of an action movie's plot or questions the plausibility of a debater's claims and arguments. If you aren't sure you believe something, you'll question its plausibility. The Latin root is <i>plausibilis</i>, "deserving applause or acceptable."</p></div></div>`;
