A related sense is "to be grateful for something," but this usage can sound wordy. Instead of "I would <i>appreciate</i> your sending me more information," consider: "Please send me more information." The word can also be used (without a direct object) to mean "to rise in worth": "The vintage Corvette would <i>appreciate</i> in value over the years."</p></div></div>`;
