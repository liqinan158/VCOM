If the surgeon operates on the wrong leg when you go in for knee surgery? Now, that’s a <i>mishap</i> to get upset about.</p><p class="long">You might assume that <i>hap</i> is short for happening, but it is actually an Old Norse word for "luck." So with <i>mis</i> ("bad") in front of it, it literally means “bad luck.” Mishaps can be accidents of great consequence or minimal consequence. People often say that an event went off “without a <i>mishap</i>,” meaning that it went smoothly. Hopefully this will be the case if you ever get knee surgery.</p></div></div>`;
