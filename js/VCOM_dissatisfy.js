If you promise your dad a chocolate cake for his birthday, giving him a bran muffin instead might <i>dissatisfy</i> him.</p><p class="long">To satisfy someone is to fulfill what they need or hope for â€” and when you dissatisfy them, you fail to do that. Your final research paper might dissatisfy your history professor, and an expensive meal will dissatisfy you if you believe you could cook something even tastier at home. <i>Dissatisfy</i> combines <i>dis-</i>, "do the opposite of," with <i>satisfy</i>, from its Latin root <i>satisfacere</i>, "discharge fully" or "do enough."</p></div>`;
