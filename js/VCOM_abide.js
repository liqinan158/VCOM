If you can't <i>abide</i> with something, it means you can't stand it. If you can<i> abide</i> it, it means you can live with it.</p><p class="long">An old definition of <i>abide</i> is "to live" â€” think of <i>abode</i>, as in "dwelling." If you abide by the rules, it means you live with them, and you will follow them. If you can't abide your sister's shrill violin playing, it means you can't live with it, you can't be in the house when she's practicing. You abide something you don't like, like your teacher's long stories about math. It's not a pleasant experience, but what choice do you have?</p></div>`;
