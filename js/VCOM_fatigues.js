Another name for fatigues is "battledress," as opposed to the more formal dress uniforms worn by members of all military branches. Fatigues are what soldiers wear when they're working or engaging in battle. In the 1770's, <i>fatigues</i> meant "extra duties of a soldier," from <i>fatigue</i>, or tiredness. It came to also mean "military clothing" in the mid-1880's.</p></div>`;
