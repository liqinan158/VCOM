If you've got a special rubber ducky, that’s one of your <i>possessions,</i> and it  may even be your prized <i>possession.</i></p><p class="long">Possession is all about control: if you have possession of something, you own it, or have your hands on it. If your house keys are in your possession, you know where they are. In soccer being in possession means having control of the ball; in hockey, it’s having your stick on the puck. A possession can also be a territory controlled by another government, as Puerto Rico is a possession of the United States.</p></div>`;
