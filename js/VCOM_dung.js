When farmers talk about cow dung or chicken dung, they'll probably call it <i>manure</i> instead. Some dung causes problems, like the runoff of pig dung into lakes and rivers, while other dung is used to help fertilize vegetable gardens. <i>Dung</i> is an Old English word, from a Germanic root — in Old High German, a <i>tung</i> was an underground room that was covered with dung for warmth.</p></div>`;
