People who eat <i>anchovies</i> enjoy their strong, fishy flavor.</p><p class="long">While you can buy fresh anchovies from many fish markets, they're most commonly sold packed in small tins, covered in salt and oil. Fishermen often use anchovies as bait for larger fish as well. Even people who don't think they like anchovies are sometimes familiar with the taste, as they're used in Caesar salad dressing and Worcestershire sauce. <i>Anchovy</i> comes from the Portuguese <i>anchova</i>, possibly from the Latin <i>apua</i>, "small fish."</p></div></div>`;
