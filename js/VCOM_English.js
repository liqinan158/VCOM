Mix in Romance languages such as the Latin-based Norman French and some old Norse, and you have the smorgasbord that is our modern English. Note that the english or "spin" you put on a billiard or bowling ball seems to have evolved separately, from the French <i>angl√©</i>, meaning "angle."</p></div>`;
