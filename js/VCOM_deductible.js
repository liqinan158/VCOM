Strange that one <i>deductible</i> can be so friendly and the other one so mean.</p><p class="long">The Latin <i>deducere</i>, meaning "to derive," eventually became the word <i>deduct</i>, meaning "to take away." In the mid-19th century, the word <i>deductible</i> was born, meaning something "may be deducted." As a noun, a <i>deductible</i> is something you pay, such as your insurance deductible. As an adjective, <i>deductible</i> describes something you can subtract from a total, usually from your taxes. Andy Warhol once said, “Employees make the best dates. You don't have to pick them up and they're always tax-deductible.”</p></div></div>`;
