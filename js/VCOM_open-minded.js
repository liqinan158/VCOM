An <i>open-minded</i> voter doesn't always stick to his or her political party and instead considers the opinions of candidates from both parties. (Finding an <i>open-minded</i> voter is a bit like trying to find a unicorn. Good luck.)</p><p class="long">When you've got a serious dilemma — say your two best friends aren't speaking to each other — it's usually helpful to ask an open-minded person for advice. Open-minded people can consider a problem from both sides, without injecting their own opinions or biases, and can often point you in the right direction. <i>Open-minded</i> is first recorded in the 1820s, from the popular figurative meaning of <i>open</i> (think "openhearted").</p></div>`;
