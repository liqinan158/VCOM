Think <i>dull</i>.</p><p class="long">Shakespeare gave us the compound <i>lackluster</i>, first using the term in his play <i>As You Like It</i>. In 2:7, the character Jacques says, "And then he drew a dial from his poke, And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye..." Since Shakespeare first coined this word, it has been used to describe anything "blah"; <i>lackluster</i> sales would worry shop owners and a lackluster prom dress might help you blend in with the wallpaper.</p></div>`;
