Imagine digging a hole in the ground, then covering the hole with a layer of sticks and leaves.  When someone walks on it, they fall in.  That’s the basic idea of subversion, attacking from below.  People often use subversion to take down a corrupt government, and acts of subversion are a powerful way to protest injustice.</p></div>`;
