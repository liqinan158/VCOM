When you eat at a sushi place, you can use <i>chopsticks</i> or your fingers.</p><p class="long">If you master using chopsticks, you'll feel comfortable eating in Chinese or Japanese restaurants. The two slender sticks, of equal length, are held between the first fingers and thumb and moved to grab morsels of food. Chopsticks are often made of bamboo, though they can also be plastic, wood, or metal. In China, it's considered bad manners to stick your chopsticks upright in your rice, while in Vietnam it's bad luck to lay them down in a <i>V</i> shape.</p></div>`;
