You can use the word to talk about things that are truly offensive or outrageous — someone snatching your grandmother's purse, for example — or things that are merely aggravating or annoying. You might find it infuriating trying to parallel park on a busy street or waiting in line at the post office. The roots of <i>infuriating</i> can be traced all the way back to the Latin <i>furere</i>, which means "to rage" or "to be mad."</p></div></div>`;
