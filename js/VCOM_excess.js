Eating to <i>excess</i> makes your stomach hurt, and spending to <i>excess</i> means you can't pay your credit card bills.</p><p class="long"><i>Excess</i> comes from the Latin word <i>excessus</i> meaning, "go out, going beyond the bounds of reason," like eating and spending in excess. (Not so reasonable.) Although it spends most of its time as a noun, it can also be an adjective to describe "more than is required or needed," like when excess water spills over the top of the bathtub, or those excess pounds spill over the top of your jeans.</p></div>`;
