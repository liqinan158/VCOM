var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">utter</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The adjective <i>utter</i> is often used as an intensifier to mean "total" — often with negative connotations (like "<i>utter</i> failure"). As a verb, the word has a totally unrelated meaning: to speak or to articulate a sound.</p><p class="long">If you utter something, you give it voice. You could utter a cry or utter complete sentences; either way, you are expressing yourself. However, if you declare someone an utter moron, you are saying he is a complete and total moron; not that he is a moron expressing himself. Don't confuse the spelling of <i>utter</i> with <i>udder</i> — the latter is the part of the cow that you milk.</p></div>`;
