Saying <i>butt</i> is more childish than offensive.</p><p class="long"><i>Butt</i> is a four-letter word, though using it won't get you in much trouble â€” It's much less offensive than <i>ass</i>. It also has plenty of other meanings, like butting into a conversation (interrupting it) or the butt of a gun (the thick end). If you make fun of someone, they are the butt of your jokes. The used end of a cigarette is called a butt, too. But you'll hear it more often in phrases like "Get your butt in here!"</p></div>`;
