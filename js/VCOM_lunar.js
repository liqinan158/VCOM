If you like astronomy, you probably enjoy <i>lunar</i> eclipses, when the Earth casts its shadow on the moon.</p><p class="long"><i>Lunar</i> comes from the Latin word <i>luna</i>, meaning moon. The Roman goddess of the moon is called Luna (Selene in Greek mythology). There are lunar eclipses, a lunar calendar, lunar tides, and lunar orbits. Maybe you want to be the first live-in chef on a lunar space station. You can also hear <i>lunar</i> in the word <i>lunatic</i> â€” they used to think insanity was related to the cycles of the moon.</p></div>`;
