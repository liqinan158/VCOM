var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">ravishing</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The adjective <i>ravishing</i> describes something or someone of exceptional beauty. If you say the dress your friend picked for the prom is <i>ravishing</i>, you mean it's beautiful and she looks beautiful in it.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>ravishing</i> comes from the verb <i>ravish</i>, which is from the Latin word <i>rapere</i>, meaning to seize. In English, the verb meant to plunder or to carry away, and later a sense arose that meant to carry away in pleasure, or to seduce. So a dress that is ravishing is seductive or sexy––or, as the word became more popular, simply beautiful, as in "<i>ravishing</i> scenery."</p></div>`;
