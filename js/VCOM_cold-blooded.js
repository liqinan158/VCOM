var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">cold-blooded</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>cold-blooded</i> animal has a body temperature that varies along with the outdoor temperature, and a <i>cold-blooded</i> person is someone who seems to feel no emotions. Your pet lizard may love you, but she's still <i>cold-blooded</i>.</p><p class="long">During a hot, sunny day, a cold-blooded animal like a snake experiences a rise in body temperature, which it can only moderate by finding a shady spot to hide. When the sun goes down at night, a snake's body temperature falls. Cold-blooded people, on the other hand, regulate their body temperature even when it's chilly outside, like other warm-blooded animals. They're cruel and unfeeling, though. This meaning comes from the old-fashioned belief that blood temperature rises with emotion.</p></div>`;
