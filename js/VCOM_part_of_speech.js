In English there are usually eight <i>parts of speech</i>: nouns, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives, prepositions, conjunctions, and yikes! Interjections.</p><p class="long">Dividing words into the parts of speech is a great way to understand how sentences work. In a nutshell, modifiers gotta modify — adjectives modify nouns and pronouns (<i>brown</i> bear), and adverbs modify verbs (runs <i>quickly</i>). Verbs are the heart of the sentence. No sentence is complete without one. Run! (That’s a complete sentence.) Prepositions show a relationship (under, over), and conjunctions (but, and) connect words and phrases. And dang, interjections (wow!) just want to have fun.</p></div></div>`;
