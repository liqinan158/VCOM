If you're silently angry, your contained rage is <i>smoldering</i>, too.</p><p class="long">Just like a fire that doesn't go out completely, this word is used for emotions that also refuse to die out â€” they just keep going, though under the surface. If you keep a lid on your feelings, but are mad at someone, your feelings are smoldering. People often talk about smoldering feelings of love or lust: in romance novels and romantic comedies, there will be smoldering feelings and smoldering looks. This is a word for emotional heat that keeps burning.</p></div>`;
