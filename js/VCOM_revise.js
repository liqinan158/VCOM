When you want your writing to be really great, you must <i>revise</i> it several times until it is perfect.</p><p class="long">The word <i>revise</i> sounds like the related word <i>revisit</i>, and revising a piece of work does in fact require revisiting it. Planning out a project includes estimating how much it will cost and when it will be done. If something unforeseen happens, you might have to revise your estimates of cost and completion date. You can also use <i>revise</i> as a noun. Once you finish the first draft of an essay, you can begin working on the revise.</p></div></div>`;
