Your <i>repletion</i> at the end of a meal probably means you'll skip dessert.</p><p class="long">Repletion is experienced by people who are full or satisfied by the amount of food they've eaten, but it can also describe other kinds of fullness. You might have a satisfied sense of repletion after being showered with praise â€” in other words, you're feeling utterly satiated with compliments. Being <i>replete</i> means being full, filled, or well-supplied, and both words come from a Latin root, <i>repletus</i>, or "filled."</p></div>`;
