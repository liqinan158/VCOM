A sweater-vest with reindeer on it is <i>appropriate</i> holiday apparel, even if it's totally embarrassing.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>appropriate</i> is used when something is suitable or fitting. It comes from the Latin <i>appropriare</i>, which means "to make something fit, to make something one's own." Going back even further, <i>appropriate</i> is related to the Latin word <i>proprius</i>, "to belong to a person, thing, or group." Another appropriate way to use this word is as a verb, meaning to steal or seize something, the way you'd appropriate your sister's sandwich if she left it sitting near you.</p></div></div>`;
