Hordes of people walking around your town with cameras might be due to an <i>upsurge</i> in tourism, for example.</p><p class="long">News shows often announce that there's an upsurge of crime or an upsurge of available jobs in public education. The noun <i>upsurge</i> is most often used in this figurative way, rather than to talk about something literally surging up, like stormy waves. These are more likely to be described as a <i>surge</i>, which is actually the root of <i>upsurge</i> â€” a surge is a "high, rolling swell of water," from the Latin <i>surgere</i>, "to rise."</p></div></div>`;
