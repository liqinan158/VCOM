Your eyes are open and you look like you're awake, but you’re really sleeping. <i>Somnambulate</i> is a wonderful word, and you may recognize the Latin roots: <i>somnus,</i> "sleep," as in <i>somniferous,</i> “something putting you to sleep,” <i>somnolent,</i> “sleepy, or making you sleepy,” and Sominex, the brand name of a sleeping pill. <i>Ambulare</i> means "to walk," as in <i>amble,</i> “to stroll,” and "ambulance" the vehicle that gets you to the hospital.</p></div></div>`;
