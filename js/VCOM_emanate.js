If spooky sounds <i>emanate</i> from the closet, don’t open the door!</p><p class="long">The word <i>emanate</i> comes from the Latin <i>emanare</i>, which means “to flow out.” Things that emanate come from somewhere. Heat emanates from a fire, and smoke emanates from a chimney. This word can also be used figuratively: for example, you might say that your upbeat and optimistic best friend emanates positivity.</p></div>`;
