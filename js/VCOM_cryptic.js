It's totally <i>cryptic</i>. <i>Cryptic</i> comments or messages are hard to understand because they seem to have a hidden meaning.</p><p class="long"><i>Cryptic</i> is from Late Latin <i>crypticus,</i> from Greek <i>kryptos</i>, "hidden." This Greek adjective is the source of the English noun <i>crypt</i>, referring to a room under a church in which dead people are buried. That might account for why the word <i>cryptic</i> has an eerie tone to it.</p></div>`;
