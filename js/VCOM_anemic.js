If you're <i>anemic</i>, your body has a shortage of healthy red blood cells.</p><p class="long">Often when someone's diagnosed as being anemic, they're counseled to eat more foods that contain iron, which can help rebuild the red blood cells in their body. Besides looking pale, an anemic person is often tired and weak. Another, non-medical, meaning of <i>anemic</i> is simply "lacking in vitality or energy." Both meanings come originally from the Greek <i>anaimia</i>, "lack of blood." The British spelling of <i>anemic</i> is <i>anaemic</i>.</p></div></div>`;
