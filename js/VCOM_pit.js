A <i>pit</i> can also be smaller indentation. There’s also a <i>pit</i> hiding inside a peach.</p><p class="long"><i>Pit</i> is a word with a wide variety of meanings. There's the pit you dig on the beach as a moat for your sandcastle, and the pit a hunter digs for trapping an animal. Then there's the sunken area of a performance hall where musicians play, an orchestra pit, and the area that's reserved for certain activity, like the trading pit at a stock exchange. Finally, a <i>pit</i> is also a large, hard seed — like a peach pit.</p></div>`;
