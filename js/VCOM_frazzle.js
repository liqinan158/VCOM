Parents are frazzled by their children crying and running around. A difficult job like serving as a police officer is extremely frazzling. Doing anything that takes a mental, emotional, or physical toll is frazzling. When someone feels tired, they will often say "I'm <i>frazzled</i>!"</p></div></div>`;
