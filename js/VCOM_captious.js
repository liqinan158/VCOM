Try not to be described as a <i>captious</i> person yourself, however. No one likes a carping individual!</p><p class="long"><i>Captious</i> comes from the Middle French word <i>captieux</i>, which is from the Latin word <i>captiosus</i> meaning fallacious or deceiving. This is, in fact, another meaning for the adjective <i>captious</i>, something is calculated to confuse or deceive â€” such as a captious explanation of the facts. When a person is described as captious, the sense is usually of nitpicking at faults or raising petty objections. It is usually used to imply a permanent character or personality flaw, as opposed to a momentary lapse in understanding.</p></div></div>`;
