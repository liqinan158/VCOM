You may think of <i>peanuts</i> as nuts, but they're actually legumes.</p><p class="long">Despite the deceptive name <i>peanut</i>, this plant is more closely related to peas than it is to almonds and hazelnuts. Peanuts are an important food crop around the world, in the form of oil, flour, peanut butter, and roasted, whole peanuts. Peanuts were originally called "ground nuts," and despite their popularity, they're also known for being inexpensive â€” thus <i>peanuts</i> also informally means "a very small amount of money."</p></div>`;
