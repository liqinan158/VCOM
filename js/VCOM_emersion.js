The <i>emersion</i> of your friend's head from the water is a relief if he's been holding his breath at the bottom of the pool for a really long time.</p><p class="long">It's especially common to use the noun <i>emersion</i> when you're talking about something or someone rising from the water after being submerged beneath the surface. On a whale watch, people gaze at the ocean hoping to see the emersion of a whale, and in many harbors you can also see the emersion of seals' heads if you watch the water long enough. It's easy to confuse <i>emersion</i> with its opposite, <i>immersion</i>. <i>Emersion</i> shares a Latin root with <i>emerge</i> â€” <i>emergere</i>, "rise up."</p></div></div>`;
