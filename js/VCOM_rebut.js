If your parents say you're too young and irresponsible to drive, you can <i>rebut</i> their claim by ticking off examples of your responsibility.</p><p class="long">When you argue against something, you rebut that position or argument. Your school's principal might rebut your teacher's argument that the class is overcrowded by pointing out that there could legally be five more kids in the class. The teacher could rebut the principal's rebuttal by observing that there aren't enough books or seats for the kids in the classroom now. <i>Rebut</i> comes from an old French word <i>rebuter</i>, meaning "to thrust back."</p></div>`;
