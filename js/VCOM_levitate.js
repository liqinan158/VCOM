It also means to cause something to do that. With a magnetic force — or a magic wand — you might be able to make your teacher <i>levitate</i> above your classroom.</p><p class="long"><i>Levitate</i> comes from the Latin <i>levis</i>, meaning “light.” Something that is light can levitate easily. Magicians levitate things like pigs and snowmobiles and women as part of their shows. In architecture, certain structures can be raised or suspended so as to appear to levitate.</p></div>`;
