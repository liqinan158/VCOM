You could get a <i>summons</i> to testify at a trial, for example.</p><p class="long">When you summon someone, you're requesting the person to join you, essentially saying, "Come here!" Similarly, a <i>summons</i> asks for someone to appear. This could be a friendly request or invitation, like a summons to join some friends for a road trip, but the most common type of summons is official and legally binding. If you receive a summons to appear in court, you have to show up. Ignoring that kind of summons is a crime.</p></div></div>`;
