But otters aren't as common as they once were â€” many otter species are considered endangered today: they were hunted for their fur when settlers first came to North America, and since then they have been threatened by pollution and climate change. The root of the word <i>otter</i>, appropriately enough, means "water creature."</p></div>`;
