It's important to <i>sterilize</i> tools, hands, and furniture in hospitals so germs don't get spread between patients.</p><p class="long">People who make their own jam and pickles need to sterilize the jars first, and when you feed a tiny baby it's important to sterilize the bottles. Whenever you need to make sure something is as clean as possible, you should sterilize it. The earliest meaning of <i>sterilize</i> is still in use, too: to "make infertile," or to make it impossible for an organism to reproduce or have a baby.</p></div>`;
