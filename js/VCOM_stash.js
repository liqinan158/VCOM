Your little brother might <i>stash</i> his Halloween candy under his bed, for example.</p><p class="long">Use the word <i>stash</i> as a verb that means "hoard" or "stockpile," or as a noun â€” a pirate's secret pile of gold doubloons can be called a stash, and so can the collection of overdue library books you've got piled beside your bed. The verb version of <i>stash</i> was originally a late 1700's criminals' slang word meaning "conceal." It may have come from a combination of <i>stow</i> and <i>cache</i>.</p></div></div>`;
