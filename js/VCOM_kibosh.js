Kids often feel like their teachers and parents are constantly putting the kibosh on their fun, and you may be disappointed when a rainy day puts the kibosh on your picnic plans. The origin of <i>kibosh</i> is unknown â€” though many people think it's Yiddish, the word's earliest use was probably in an Irish neighborhood in London in the early 1800s.</p></div></div>`;
