If you spend too much time watching TV instead of fulfilling other obligations, you might circumscribe your TV-watching time to one hour daily (or two hours, if your favorite show is on).</p><p class="long"><i>Circumscribe</i> comes from the Latin words <i>circum</i>, meaning "around," and <i>scribere</i>, meaning "to write." If the word <i>circumscribe</i> causes you to think of geometry class, give yourself a pat on the back. In geometry, <i>circumscribe</i> means to draw one geometric figure around another figure so that the two figures touch but donâ€™t intersect. If you studied geometry but this sounds unfamiliar, perhaps you should have taken our advice about watching too much TV.</p></div>`;
