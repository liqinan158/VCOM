During a blizzard your mother might, <i>of necessity</i>, serve leftovers three nights in a row.</p><p class="long">The phrase <i>of necessity</i> is an adverb that means, basically, "inevitably," or "necessarily." When you do something of necessity, you have to do it. A teacher's voice might of necessity be loud and sharp, to get the attention of distracted students, and a neighborhood shop might of necessity be closed unexpectedly because of water damage from a heavy rainstorm and a leaky roof. <i>Necessity</i> comes from the Latin <i>necessitatem</i>, "unavoidableness."</p></div>`;
