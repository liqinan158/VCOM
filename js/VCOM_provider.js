If your parents both have jobs so they can feed you and buy you what you need, you can call them <i>providers</i>.</p><p class="long">Your mom's a provider if she works so she can care for you, put food on the table, and send you to school. There are other types of providers as well, although they all give you something you need, often a service. Your school is a provider of education, and the pharmacy around the corner is a provider of medication, makeup, and magazines. It's increasingly common to call your main doctor a "primary care <i>provider</i>."</p></div>`;
