The <i>dregs</i> are the least wanted portion, or the residue.</p><p class="long">Literally speaking, <i>dregs</i> refers to sediment at the bottom of a liquid such as tea, but figuratively you can use <i>dregs</i> to mean “a small amount left.” If you are running out of food in your refrigerator, you might say, “We’re down to the <i>dregs</i> in here.” <i>Dregs</i> is also used in the same way as the expression “bottom of the barrel.” The “<i>dregs</i> of society,” for instance, is a negative phrase that describes people whom the speaker considers to be useless.</p></div></div>`;
