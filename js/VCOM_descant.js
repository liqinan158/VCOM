Many church hymns include a <i>descant</i>, sung at a higher pitch than the melody. Literary types use <i>descant</i> as a verb to mean "talk on and on in a dull way."</p><p class="long">In medieval times, a descant was an improvised tune that singers or musicians added to a fixed melody. The medieval Latin term was <i>discantus</i>, "refrain" or "part-song," from <i>dis-</i>, "apart," and <i>cantus</i>, "song or bird-song." Through the years, the word has been used for the soprano in a group of singers or the highest-pitched line in any song.</p></div></div>`;
