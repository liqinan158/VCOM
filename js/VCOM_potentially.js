All babies are potentially geniuses, and you might optimistically watch new TV comedies every fall in the belief that they're potentially funny. In other words, babies might turn out to be brilliant, and TV shows have the possibility of making you laugh out loud. The root word here is <i>potential</i>, from the Latin <i>potentia</i>, "power, might or force."</p></div></div>`;
