The word can apply to things and also to people. You might <i>detest</i> your ex-boyfriend and you might also <i>detest</i> rainy Mondays and broccoli.</p><p class="long"><i>Detest</i> comes from the Middle French word <i>d√©tester</i>, meaning "to curse, to call God to witness and abhor." Though the words <i>detest</i> and <i>hate</i> are interchangeable, the word <i>hate</i> is much more common, which has caused it to lose some of its hateful impact. <i>Detest</i> is used more sparingly, reserved for cases where no other word will do, where your feelings of dislike are so powerful that they need just the right word to sum them up.</p></div>`;
