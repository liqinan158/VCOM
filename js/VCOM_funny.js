Comedians make their living being <i>funny</i>.</p><p class="long">It seems like the adjective <i>funny</i> should describe something <i>fun</i> — but it doesn’t always. A fun rollercoaster ride might make you scream instead of laugh. In fact, <i>funny</i> is also used in the sense of something that is fishy or shady, or just a little odd, like a funny feeling, or a person who seems a little funny, meaning weird. So if someone calls you funny, make sure they are smiling before you thank them for the compliment.</p></div>`;
