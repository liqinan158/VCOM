In Western cultures, <i>pallbearers</i> are usually family members or close friends of the person who has died.</p><p class="long">Traditionally, pallbearers were men, all of whom wore white gloves as a sign of respect for the deceased person. These days, anyone can be a pallbearer. In some Eastern traditions, pallbearers are never members of the family, but instead are paid helpers. The word <i>pallbearer</i> comes from <i>pall</i>, "cloth spread over a coffin," and <i>bearer</i>, or "carrier."</p></div></div>`;
