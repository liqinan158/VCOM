However, <i>battery</i> has a whole host of meanings. In addition to beating someone as in "assault and <i>battery</i>," it also refers to a collection of artillery or guns: “He’s collected a <i>battery</i> of weapons; we hope he doesn’t intend to use them." Beyond guns, a <i>battery</i> can also refer to any group or collection of similar things: “She was subjected to a <i>battery</i> of tests, designed to determine whether she was a genius or just plain smart.”</p></div>`;
