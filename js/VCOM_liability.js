A company's <i>liabilities</i> are simply the debts on its ledger, but a personal <i>liability</i> might be your extreme shyness in social situations.</p><p class="long">Depending on how you use it, the word <i>liability</i> has very different meanings. In a business or financial sense, a <i>liability</i> is a debt or fiscal obligation, like a mortgage or a loan. A limited <i>liability</i> company means if the company fails, the partners are on the hook for only what they initially invested in the company. A personal <i>liability</i>, however, is some element of your past, your character, or your behavior that might give you a disadvantage.</p></div>`;
