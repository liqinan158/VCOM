Bollywood dancers are often outfitted with many gold <i>bangles</i>.</p><p class="long">A bangle is generally made out of some hard material like gold, silver, wood, plastic, or ivory. In most parts of South Asia, bangles are very commonly worn by women â€” there are special bangles that a bride, for example, traditionally wears at her wedding. In Hinduism, it's actually considered bad luck for a bride not to wear bangles. The root of <i>bangle</i> is the Hindi word <i>bangri</i>, "colored glass bracelet or anklet."</p></div>`;
