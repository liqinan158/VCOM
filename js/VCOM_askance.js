Find a happy medium by looking <i>askance</i>, or subtly out of the corner of your eye.</p><p class="long">First used in the 1500's, no one is quite sure where the cockeyed, slanting adverb <i>askance</i> came from. Some people suspect that it evolved from the Latin <i>a scancio</i>, meaning “obliquely, slantingly,” while others argue that it’s just a variant of the word <i>askew</i>. How fitting for a word that describes a suspicious or distrusting manner of looking that we can't trace its etymology with any surety.</p></div></div>`;
