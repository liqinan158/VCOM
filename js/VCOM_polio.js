This is lucky, since there's no treatment for <i>polio</i>.</p><p class="long">Before scientists developed a way to prevent polio (which is actually short for <i>poliomyelitis</i>), it was a fairly common childhood illness that spread easily. While many people infected with polio had no symptoms at all, it did cause paralysis in some, and resulted in death for others. The U.S. experienced a polio epidemic in 1952 that left over 20,000 people paralyzed. Jonas Salk is credited with the first effective vaccine against polio, in the mid-1950s.</p></div></div>`;
