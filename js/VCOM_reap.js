When your great audition gets you cast in your dream role, you <i>reap</i> the benefits of all that rehearsing you did.</p><p class="long"><i>Reap</i> can also describe the act of harvesting crops. The farmer will then sell the crop, reaping a profit. Here, <i>reap</i> means the same as <i>gain</i>. You may have heard the expression "what you reap is what you sow," which comes from the New Testament and can apply to farming and everything else â€” if, for example, you are patient with other people, they in turn will be patient with you.</p></div>`;
