var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">sniff out</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>sniff out</i> is to discover or detect something, the way a detective might <i>sniff out</i> a criminal's hideout or a four year-old <i>sniffs out</i> the cookies you hid at the back of a cupboard.</p><p class="long">To understand the verb <i>sniff out</i>, imagine a police dog literally sniffing for clues. Detectives sniff out criminals and reporters sniff out the details of a story or a scandal, even when they don't actually use their noses. This figurative meaning of smelling to indicate suspicion has been around a long long time and relates to the concept of something rotten smelling bad; just think back to Shakespeare's use of "There's something rotten in the state of Denmark" to indicate Claudius's corruption. The use of the verb <i>sniff</i> to mean "smell" dates from the nineteenth century.</p></div>`;
