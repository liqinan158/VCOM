It's perfectly normal to <i>pant</i> after you finish running a marathon — or even after chasing your runaway dog through the neighborhood.</p><p class="long">You might pause at the top of a hill to pant and catch your breath before you continue on your hike. That loud, gasping breath itself is also a <i>pant</i> — but when this noun is plural, it means <i>trousers</i>, <i>slacks</i>, or <i>jeans</i>. Be careful, though — in parts of the UK, <i>pants</i> are primarily women's undergarments. Any pants you wear on you body come from <i>pantaloons</i>, which in the 1600s meant <i>tights</i>.</p></div></div>`;
