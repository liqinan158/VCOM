When you talk <i>casually</i> with a friend, you chat about this and that, rather than having a serious conversation or a formal debate.</p><p class="long">Anything you do casually is really no big deal. If you're allowed to dress casually at work or school, you can pretty much wear whatever is comfortable. When you casually hit a home run during your softball game, you make it seem easy. And if you casually stroll down the street, you're clearly in no rush. This word comes from the adjective <i>casual</i>, which comes from the Late Latin <i>casualis</i>, "by chance."</p></div>`;
