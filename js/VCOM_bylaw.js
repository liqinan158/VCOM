The <i>bylaws</i> of your school's student council might stipulate that all student council officers have to be in good academic standing.</p><p class="long">In Britain and some other countries, a <i>bylaw</i> is a local law, rather than a national one: "The city's <i>bylaws</i> don't allow me to sell my artwork without a special permit." In the U.S., bylaws apply to organizations rather than cities, towns, or states. A club's bylaws, for example, might state that each member has to pay a small membership fee. <i>Bylaw</i> is rooted in the Old Norse <i>bi-lagu</i>, "town law."</p></div>`;
