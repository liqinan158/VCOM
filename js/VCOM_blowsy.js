Your <i>blowsy</i> Aunt Jan might have long, messy hair and wear slightly shabby clothes.</p><p class="long">Traditionally, the adjective <i>blowsy</i> has been used mainly to describe dowdy older women, although it sometimes implies a perceivable sexuality as well. You can also describe lush, overblown flowers that are a bit past their peak bloom as <i>blowsy</i>: "I prefer daisies, but my mom is partial to big, <i>blowsy</i> roses." The word dates from the 17th century and comes from a now-obsolete term for "a beggar's female companion," <i>blowze</i>.</p></div></div>`;
