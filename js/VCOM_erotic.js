What makes that person so sexy? Maybe his or her <i>erotic</i> attitude or looks, meaning "arousing."</p><p class="long">The word <i>erotic</i> came into English from French — of course! — and can be traced back to the Greek word <i>erōtikos</i>, from <i>erōs</i> or <i>erōt-</i>, meaning “sexual love.” The adjective <i>erotic</i> is often used to describe a person’s carnal desires, but it can be used to characterize anything that’s sexual in nature or that arouses sexual desires, such as the erotic themes in a racy movie, an erotic dancer in a club, or erotic images in a painting.</p></div></div>`;
