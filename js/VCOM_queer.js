The main character in a creepy novel might decide to investigate the queer noises she hears coming from the attic in the middle of the night. Uh oh.</p><p class="long">Like many words, <i>queer</i> has many meanings. One is "odd," as in "I feel kind of queer today." In the 20th century, <i>queer</i> also began to be used as a slur for members of the LGBT community; although use of the word is still controversial today, it has been widely reclaimed as a positive or neutral term. Many universities have Queer Studies programs, for instance. As a verb, <i>queer</i> can mean "to endanger or expose to risk", and also "to hinder, thwart, foil, or baffle."</p></div></div>`;
