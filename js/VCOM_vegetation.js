The <i>vegetation</i> in your backyard might look very lush and green in the springtime, unless you forget to water it.</p><p class="long"><i>Vegetation</i>, as well as meaning all plant growth, can refer to the growth process of a plant. The lettuce you planted a couple weeks ago is at an early stage of vegetation. <i>Vegetation</i> can also apply to people — or at least to those in a state of inactivity. Think about how slowly plants grow. It’s the same for a person who’s in a state of vegetation. You may sometimes enjoy the mindless vegetation of doing nothing at all.</p></div></div>`;
