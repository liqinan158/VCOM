In either case, <i>listing</i> simply means "list." You can also use the word to describe the act or process of making such a list: "<i>Listing</i> all the things I want for my birthday would take far too long." The Middle English root, <i>liste</i>, means "border, or edging stripe."</p></div></div>`;
