When your class takes a trip to Russia, youâ€™ll likely have an <i>interpreter</i> to translate Russian to English so you can understand what people are saying to you.</p><p class="long">Need to talk to someone who doesn't speak your language? You'll need an interpreter. Say you're interviewing a Bulgarian diplomat, but you don't speak Bulgarian. The interpreter would listen to a few sentences in Bulgarian and then repeat them in English, and then listen to your English response and repeat that in Bulgarian. We also use <i>interpreter</i> for artists who represent ideas or places in their work. If you paint industrial cityscapes, you're an interpreter of urban life.</p></div></div>`;
