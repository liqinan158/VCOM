Acerbic speech is like acid, because it is sour and corrodes, or weakens, relationships. There are ways to use sharp words for humor, and some comedians are known for their "<i>acerbic</i> wit," but just as you would take safety precautions in using acid in a science lab, you should be cautious about using <i>acerbic</i> language in conversation.</p></div>`;
