If you're snorkeling in the Cayman Islands and see a large, flattened fish with a long tail and eyes on top of its body, you're looking at a <i>stingray</i>.</p><p class="long">Like their shark cousins, stingrays have cartilage instead of bones; stingrays look completely different from sharks, though. Stingrays' bodies are shaped like a rounded diamond, and their gills are on their underside. Their venomous tails are dangerous, giving them the <i>sting</i> part of their nameâ€”but most stingrays are shy and docile, and safe to swim near as long as you don't step on them.</p></div>`;
