Your favorite aunt might be a bit of a <i>kook</i>, with her crazy hair and wild outfits.</p><p class="long">The class clown in school is often a kook, saying nutty things in order to get attention, and you may think of the guy in your town who always holds a sign saying, "THE END IS NEAR" as a kook too. The word comes from <i>kooky</i>, "strange," probably stemming from <i>cuckoo</i>, which is a type of bird but also slang for "mad or insane person."</p></div>`;
