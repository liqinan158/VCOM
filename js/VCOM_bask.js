On the first warm day of the spring, you may <i>bask</i> in the sunshine. When you win the Pulitzer, you <i>bask</i> in your own glory.</p><p class="long">In Shakespeare’s “As You Like It,” Jaques says: “...As I do live by food, I met a fool; Who laid him down and <i>bask'd</i> him in the sun,; And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms...” That was most likely the first time <i>bask</i> was used in the way that we most often use it now: to <i>bask</i> is to warm yourself, either literally or figuratively, in the glow of the sun, good fortune, happiness, or a job well done.</p></div></div>`;
