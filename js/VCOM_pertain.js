If you think the rules of the road don't pertain to you, try explaining that to the state trooper when you get pulled over.  Usage note: The word <i>pertain</i> often takes an <i>s</i> at the end, as in "That pertains to this matter," but loses it with a helper: “That doesn’t pertain to it.”</p></div>`;
