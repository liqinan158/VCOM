You might offer an <i>apologetic</i> smile at another driver if you accidentally honk at her.</p><p class="long">Someone who's apologetic is regretful or contrite, and usually openly expresses this feeling in some way. An apologetic note might say, "I am so sorry I picked all the flowers off your rose bush!" <i>Apologetic</i> was originally a noun, and its meaning in the 1600s was much closer to "justification" than "apology." It comes from a Greek root, <i>apologetikos</i>, "defensible." It didn't come to mean "regretfully acknowledging failure" until 1855.</p></div>`;
