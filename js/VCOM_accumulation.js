You might cross your fingers in hopes of a large <i>accumulation</i> of snow, so that you get a day off of school.</p><p class="long"><i>Accumulation</i> comes from a Latin word meaning "to heap up." The word continues to have this feeling of something growing upwards on top of itself, as if in a heap. If you keep putting money in the bank, the amount you have is the accumulation of your savings. If it is an interest bearing account, the interest will accumulate, making the total even larger.</p></div>`;
