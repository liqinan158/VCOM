It is used for a time of great consequence or for a major accomplishment, and is almost always reserved for good things.</p><p class="long">When a moment is so great you know you'll never forget it, you have just experienced something <i>momentous</i>. It can be personal — perhaps the day you were named prom queen; or something historic — like the day Elizabeth was named Queen of England. <i>Momentous</i> and <i>momentary</i> share the root word <i>moment</i> but <i>momentary</i> describes just one fleeting moment in time. A momentary occurrence can certainly be <i>momentous</i>, but it's not always the case.</p></div>`;
