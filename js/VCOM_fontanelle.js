Even though the <i>fontanelle</i> seems delicate, it's actually quite sturdy and protective.</p><p class="long">The fontanelle allows a newborn baby's brain to continue growing, while the skull expands more slowly. It also means the bones of the skull can flex a bit when the baby is born â€” in other words, it can compress as it's squeezed through the birth canal without damaging the baby's head. As babies grow, the fontanelle begins to close. The Old French root of <i>fontanelle</i>, <i>fontaine</i>, means "hollow in the earth where a spring arises."</p></div></div>`;
