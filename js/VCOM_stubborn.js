var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">stubborn</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the adjective <i>stubborn</i> to describe someone who is not open to new ideas or ways of doing things, like your uncle who refuses to listen to any music made after 1990. <i>Stubborn</i> is the opposite of <i>flexible</i>.</p><p class="long">The Middle English version of <i>stubborn</i> carried the sense of “untamable, implacable,” and there’s still a hint of that in how it is used today. A stubborn person holds on to a view or an attitude, refusing to change — to the point of being unreasonable. Things can also be stubborn, like a stain that no amount of scrubbing can clean or a medical condition that, even with treatment, doesn't improve.</p></div></div>`;
