Some people love roller coasters so much that they feel a <i>frisson</i> of excitement just looking at one.</p><p class="long">You're just as likely to feel a frisson whether you're scared or excited; its meaning lies directly between thrill and fear. When you hear a scary sound in the basement late at night, and open the door to investigate, you might feel a <i>frisson</i> of fear as you start to descend the steps. The Latin root is <i>frigere</i>, "to be cold," and while a frisson is certainly shivery, its source is a thrill rather than a chill.</p></div></div>`;
