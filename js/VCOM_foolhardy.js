Everest next weekend without any training or experience, that would be a <i>foolhardy</i> decision. Use the adjective <i>foolhardy</i> to describe someone who rushes into action without considering the consequences.</p><p class="long"><i>Foolhardy</i> is a combination of the noun <i>fool</i> and the adjective <i>hardy</i>, meaning "brave" or "bold." Put them together and you’ve got “foolishly brave.” Someone who is foolhardy throws caution to the wind and takes reckless chances. A foolhardy mistake is typically the result of this kind of impulsive behavior. But <i>foolhardy</i> doesn’t always imply foolishness or stupidity; <i>foolhardy</i> can convey courage and romance, as in the case of a foolhardy passion or desire.</p></div>`;
