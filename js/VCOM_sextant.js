Used as a navigational tool out at sea, it helps determine a ship's longitude and latitude.</p><p class="long">There is nothing sexy about a sextant, unless you're a sailor. Even then, in today's world of sophisticated instrumentation, it's considered quaint and old-fashioned. The noun <i>sextant</i> dates back to the late 16th century, from the Latin word <i>sextans</i>, meaning "sixth part." The sextant uses a graduated arc of 60° (there's the <i>six</i> reference) for measuring the altitude of the planets and stars.</p></div>`;
