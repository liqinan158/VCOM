If you buy a house with a mortgage at a high interest rate, you may be able to <i>refinance</i> later and pay less each month.</p><p class="long">When you take out a loan from a bank, you always have to pay interest â€” you agree to pay the money back, plus a certain monthly or yearly percentage of it. If this percentage is high, or the monthly payment is too much, you can sometimes refinance the loan and get new terms that are better. <i>Finance</i> was originally an Old French word meaning "payment" or "settlement of a debt."</p></div></div>`;
