Medically speaking, <i>pus</i> is made up of various types of white blood cells that have died.</p><p class="long">Bacteria can cause infections, and when the infected area becomes inflamed, pus often forms and collects under the skin. A boil or pimple full of pus can be painful, and seeing pus in a wound is a sign that you should go to the doctor, who will prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection and may also drain the pus. The Latin <i>pus</i> means "matter from a sore" but also "bitterness or malice."</p></div></div>`;
