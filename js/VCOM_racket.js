A <i>racket</i> has a handle and a rounded frame laced with strings, and it's used to hit a ball.</p><p class="long">A racket is used to play tennis, badminton, or squash, and it can also be spelled <i>racquet</i>. Another definition of <i>racket</i> is an unpleasantly loud noise; if your neighbors were playing horrible, loud music, you could yell out the window, "Stop that <i>racket</i>!" Informally, the word <i>racket</i> also means "illegal scheme," especially for making money. The French word <i>requette</i> means "palm of the hand," and <i>racquet</i> originally referred to a tennis-like game played by hitting a ball with the hand.</p></div></div>`;
