It's a coverall garment that gives a certain ceremonial look in various Christian services. The Latin root, curiously, means "over fur garment;" The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica helpfully informs us that "it was formerly put on over the fur garments which used to be worn in church as a protection against the cold."</p></div>`;
