Anything described as required is similarly demanded by some person or organization. A license is required to drive. A credit card is required to get a hotel room. A helmet is required in football. Sometimes this word is used more loosely. For example, a glass of water will be required for most people after a workout. That just means the water is needed.</p></div></div>`;
