An <i>obliging</i> neighbor, for example, might volunteer to shovel your sidewalk after it snows.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>obliging</i> is perfect for describing someone who is especially considerate and helpful. An obliging co-worker will always come to your aid or chip in for donuts, and an obliging roommate will turn off her light when you're ready to go to sleep. The word has been around since the mid-1600s, and it comes from the verb <i>oblige</i>, with its Latin root <i>obligare</i>, which means both "to bind up or bandage" and "to put under obligation or commitment."</p></div>`;
