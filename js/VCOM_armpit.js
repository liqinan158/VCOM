Perhaps because your armpits tend to get sweaty and a little smelly after you exercise, the word <i>armpit</i> is sometimes used as a derogatory term for an unattractive place: "That city is so ugly it's the <i>armpit</i> of New Jersey." Before <i>armpit</i>, the axilla was known as an <i>arm-hole</i>.</p></div>`;
