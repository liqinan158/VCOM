You could describe a race by explaining that it was <i>nip and tuck</i> until the last twenty yards, when one runner pulled ahead.</p><p class="long">Another way to say <i>nip and tuck</i> is "neck and neck." Two racehorses moving right next to each other, noses even, are nip and tuck. A newer, less formal, but even more common meaning of <i>nip and tuck</i> is a very little bit of plastic or cosmetic surgery. You might hear someone say, "I just need a little <i>nip and tuck</i> so my neck isn't quite so saggy."</p></div>`;
