Some <i>holsters</i> hold a single item, like a gun, and others are more like tool belts, holding many small items.</p><p class="long">The <i>o</i> in <i>holster</i> is long, so pronounce it like this: "HOLE-ster." Originally, the word described something very specific â€” a leather case for a pistol. It probably comes from the Old English word <i>heolster</i> (earlier <i>helustr</i>), which means "concealment, hiding place." Today, holsters may hide what they hold, but they always keep things handy.</p></div></div>`;
