They are all acronyms. Not only does each letter come from the first letter of another word, but each group of letters is easy to pronounce as its own word. Though its roots are classic (<i>acro</i> means “tip” and <i>nym</i> means “name”), <i>acronym</i> is fairly new as English words go; it has only been around since the early 1940s.</p></div></div>`;
