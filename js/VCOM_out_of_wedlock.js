You can describe someone whose parents are unwed as having been born out of wedlock, but it's more common to say something like, "She has a single mother," or "His parents aren't legally married." The phrase is based on the word <i>wedlock</i>, which is a thirteenth century way to say "marriage," from the Old English root word <i>wedlac</i> or "marriage vow."</p></div></div>`;
