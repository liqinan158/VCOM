Whales don't have <i>kneecaps</i>, but it might surprise you to know that mice and birds do.</p><p class="long">The kneecap is just what it sounds like, a protective cap for your vulnerable knee.

When babies are small, their kneecaps are made of soft cartilage, but by the time they're about three they harden into strong bone. If you're a fan of Mafia movies, you might also recognize the verb <i>kneecap</i>, "to shoot someone in the knee."</p></div></div>`;
