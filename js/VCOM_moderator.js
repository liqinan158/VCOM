It's the <i>moderator</i>'s job to make sure that none of the candidates go over their allotted time when they answer debate questions.</p><p class="long">A debate moderator has an important job, asking questions, maintaining order, and cutting off speakers when they're officially run out of time for a response. In a meeting, a moderator has similar tasks, ensuring that everyone gets a chance to speak â€” but not for too long. Online moderators can delete threatening, vulgar, or spam messages, and they also make sure discussions stay on topic. Moderators can also be more like mediators, negotiating disputes and helping people reach agreements.</p></div>`;
