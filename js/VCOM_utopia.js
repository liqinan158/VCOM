In the dead of winter, we might imagine a <i>utopia</i> full of palm trees, warm breezes, and sun-soaked beaches.</p><p class="long"><i>Utopia</i> didn't evolve from Latin or another old foreign language. Author Thomas More actually created the noun in one of his books to describe an imaginary island where all systems—political, social, and legal—are perfect and operate harmoniously. The definition of <i>utopia</i> was later broadened to imply any perfect place. The opposite of <i>utopia</i> is <i>dystopia</i>, coined in 1868 by J.S. Mill to describe an “imaginary bad place.”</p></div>`;
