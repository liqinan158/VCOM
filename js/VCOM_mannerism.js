Well, that's a <i>mannerism</i>, a habitual gesture or way of speaking.</p><p class="long">Generally, we don't use then term <i>mannerism</i> as a critical term for our friends' behavior, but when applied as a term of art criticism, it can be a negative thing. If a critic talks about a writer's <i>mannerisms,</i> for example, it's probably intended as an insult — suggesting they're writing in a lazy or clichéd way. However, <i>Mannerism</i>, with a capital "M," refers to a specific 16th-century Italian style of painting known for its artificial (as opposed to naturalistic) effects.</p></div>`;
