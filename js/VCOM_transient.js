If your older brother is constantly moving from city to city, you can say he's <i>transient</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Transient</i> is most often used to modify nouns like <i>nature, threat, source</i> and <i>cause</i>, which suggests that the word  often shows up in formal contexts, like analysis of finance or global terrorism. But it can also be used for anything that moves quickly from one thing to another, like a transient feeling or facial expression. <i>Transient</i> is also a noun meaning "a person who moves from place to place; a homeless person." The word comes from Latin <i>transire</i>, "to pass over," so you can think of it as describing things that are quickly passed over.</p></div>`;
