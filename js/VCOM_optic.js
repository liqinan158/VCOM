Your <i>optic</i> nerve, for example, sends information to your brain from your eyes.</p><p class="long">You'll most often find the adjective <i>optic</i> in anatomy or biology textbooks, describing the parts of an eye, or disorders involving the eye. Your optic disc is a tiny blind spot that all humans have on their eyeballs, and optic neuritis is an inflammation of the optic nerve. When it's a noun, <i>optic</i> is an old-fashioned, jokey way to say "eyeball." <i>Optic</i> comes from the Greek <i>optikos</i>, "of or having to do with sight."</p></div>`;
