You and your brother might have grown up arguing over who had <i>dibs</i> on riding in the front seat of the car.</p><p class="long">You'll often find the word <i>dibs</i> in the phrase "have first <i>dibs</i> on." For example, you could say, "I wanted the chocolate donut, but my sister had first <i>dibs</i> on it." Usually, having dibs on something is merely a matter of being the first person to claim it out loud. It's a late 17th century American English word that comes from children's slang, a shortened form of <i>dibstone</i>,"a jack in a children's game."</p></div>`;
