A low braid or ponytail sits at the nape of a woman's neck, and a shoulder massage often includes the nape of your neck and the base of your skull. The origin of <i>nape</i> is uncertain, though one guess is that it came from the Old French <i>hanap</i>, or "goblet," a possible reference to the hollow at the nape of the neck.</p></div></div>`;
