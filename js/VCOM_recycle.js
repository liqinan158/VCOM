You might <i>recycle</i> an old tire and make it into a snazzy black knapsack with some very cool skid marks.</p><p class="long">The prefix <i>re-</i> means again, and when you recycle something, you process it for another cycle of use. The phrase "reduce, reuse, recycle" gives you three ways to prevent waste. When you recycle plastic bottles, they’re melted down and made into new bottles or even furniture or clothing. You might do some creative recycling and turn your old textbooks into a coffee table. When you have your washing machine repeat the wash or rinse cycle, that’s a different recycle.</p></div>`;
