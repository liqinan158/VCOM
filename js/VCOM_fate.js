Better hope so. <i>Fate</i> is like destiny, so that means winning the lottery would be an inevitable outcome.</p><p class="long">The word <i>fate</i> traces back to the Latin word <i>fatum</i>, meaning “that which has been spoken,” and something that's your fate is a done deal, not open to revision. If you feel like something is your fate, you feel it's beyond your control. Fate is often referred to directly, as if it were a supernatural power: “fate tore us apart." It can also describe your lot in life, like if it's your fate to take over the family farm.</p></div></div>`;
