Often a writer uses an asterisk when she wants to add something but doesn't want to include it in the body of the story; the reader sees the asterisk, and finds another one at the bottom of the page beside the note. In Greek, <i>asterikos</i> means "little star," which perfectly describes what an asterisk looks like.</p></div></div>`;
