The root of the word is the Greek <i>erēmos</i>, meaning “solitary.”  A life of solitude isn’t for everyone, but a hermit chooses it for any number of reasons.  For example, being able to honor their religious beliefs more fully or hating all of humanity are two possible motivations to become a hermit.</p></div>`;
