Better put on your <i>wool</i> hat and scarf â€” it's freezing out there!</p><p class="long">Most wool comes from the fleece of sheep, although extra soft specialty wool (like cashmere and angora) comes from goats. In order to process wool so that it can be used to make clothing, rugs, and blankets, sheep must first be shorn. Once their fleece is cut off, it's washed and spun into yarn. If someone "pulls the wool over your eyes," they successfully fool or trick you.</p></div></div>`;
