Some <i>amputees</i> get artificial limbs that allow them to be nearly as mobile as before the loss of a limb.</p><p class="long">Some amputees lose a limb in an accident, while others have surgery to stop a disease, like gangrene, from spreading from an arm or leg to the rest of the body. The surgery to remove a limb is called an <i>amputation</i>, and it's also the word <i>amputee</i> comes from. An amputation was originally "a cutting off of tree branches," from the Latin <i>amputare</i>, "cut off, cut around, or prune."</p></div></div>`;
