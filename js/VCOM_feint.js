Well, that was a <i>feint,</i> a super sneaky move designed to fool someone.</p><p class="long">Although military and political tactics are big on feints, their most common use is probably in sports â€” particularly boxing, where opponents are continually trying to fake each other out. As in Dundee's account of an Ali-Frazier match: "Ali feinted with a jab, and Frazier threw one of his own, missing." Not to be confused with <i>faint,</i> meaning "weak or feeble." However, a feint can be deliberately faint, as Ali knew and Frazier found out when the real right hook made contact.</p></div>`;
