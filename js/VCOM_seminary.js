They all might attend a school that has the word <i>seminary</i> in its name. A <i>seminary</i> is a school, especially one where people train to be religious leaders.</p><p class="long"><i>Seminary</i> comes from the Latin word <i>seminarium</i>, meaning "plant nursery," which can be interpreted as, "breeding ground." Like a greenhouse that provides ideal conditions for seeds to grow into hearty plants, a seminary was first a place for young men to become priests. <i>Seminary</i> typically describes religious institutions but it can apply to nonreligious schools as well.</p></div>`;
