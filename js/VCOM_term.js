"Rap," "punk," "grunge," and "heavy metal" are <i>terms</i> that describe particular styles of music. "Sweetie" is a <i>term</i> of endearment, at least to most people.</p><p class="long"><i>Terms</i> can also mean the conditions of an agreement: when you rent an apartment, you agree to certain terms — that you'll pay the rent, you won't have loud parties, etc. If you're "on good <i>terms</i> with someone," you like each other. <i>Term</i> can also be a defined period of time. Spring term at school is the spring semester, and you may be assigned a term paper — to demonstrate how brilliant you've become during that time period.</p></div>`;
