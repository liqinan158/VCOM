You also <i>apprehend</i> a concept when you understand it, grasping or capturing its meaning.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>apprehend</i> has remained much the same since the original Latin, both in form and meaning. It comes from <i>apprehendere</i>, "to grasp or seize." The word came to refer to learning — "grasping or seizing with the mind" — but then came to mean "seize in the name of the law" or "arrest" around the 1540s, a meaning that remains to this day. The word can also be used to suggest an anxious feeling about something about to happen.</p></div>`;
