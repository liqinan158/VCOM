If there are four parties on Saturday night, a <i>gadabout</i> will make it to all of them.</p><p class="long">Gadabouts are known for their restless tendency to wander from place to place, and for being pleasure seekers. It can be hard to take a gadabout seriously, since having fun is their highest priority. This noun first appeared in the 19th century, from an earlier phrase, <i>gadder about</i>, "walk around idly," and the now obsolete verb <i>gad</i>, "wander randomly and frivolously."</p></div></div>`;
