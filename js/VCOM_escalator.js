When you get on an <i>escalator</i>, you can stand still and let it carry you. If you want to really annoy the people behind you, stand to the left on the <i>escalator</i> and block their passage.</p><p class="long">It's common for shopping malls, airports, and other large, public buildings to provide escalators as a way for people to get from one floor to another. An escalator works by moving a large belt of linked steps with a motor â€” each step seems to disappear as it moves parallel with the floor at your destination. In 1900, the Otis Elevator Company coined the word <i>escalator</i>, from <i>escalade</i>, "use ladders to scale a wall."</p></div></div>`;
