Spam is usually some kind of advertisement, and even though you may not be tempted to click, it's a cheap way to advertise, and it remains difficult to track down spammers and hold them accountable. The words <i>spammer</i> and <i>spam</i> come from the canned meat called <i>Spam</i> and the Monty Python comedy sketch that was inspired by it.</p></div>`;
