var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">passage</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Passage</i> describes the act of passing or traveling from one place to the next.</p><p class="long">People often use the word <i>passage</i> to specifically refer to a journey by ship, as in, "The <i>passage</i> to America was long and hard." A section of written work or music can also be called a passage.  You can think of a passage of music as moving the listener from one part of the piece to the next. And, finally, you can call a path a <i>passage</i> or <i>passageway</i>, especially when it's narrow. A street is not a passage, but the little tunnel behind the secret door in your closet is certainly a passage.</p></div>`;
