You might have a satisfying day at work, crossing things off your to-do list, or read a satisfying mystery novel that keeps you interested and eagerly turning the pages. A satisfying meal makes you content as well, but it also fills you up. This adjective comes from the verb <i>satisfy</i>, originally used to mean "repay," from a Latin root that literally means "do enough."</p></div>`;
