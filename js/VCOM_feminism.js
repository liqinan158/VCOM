If you think that a man and woman doing the exact same job should get equal pay, then you believe in one of the basic principles of <i>feminism</i>.</p><p class="long">When the word <i>feminism</i> first entered English in 1851, it referred simply to being feminine. By 1895, it had taken on its current meaning as a way to describe a theory or activity promoting womenâ€™s rights, especially back then, the right to vote. You might be familiar with the wave of feminism that took place during the 1970s, when women fought for more opportunities and equal pay.</p></div>`;
