We also use <i>horrible</i> hyperbolically (which means in an over-the-top way) to criticize things. You might think you look horrible in photos, or that a new TV reality show is horrible. Do you ever wonder if something horrible is hiding in your closet?  I mean, besides your plaid suit?</p></div></div>`;
