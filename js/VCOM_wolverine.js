You're most likely to see a <i>wolverine</i> if you go hiking in Alaska. Although they’re cute, don’t try to pet one. They are not cuddly.</p><p class="long">Wolverines are related to otters and badgers, but they're known for being the most ferocious of weasels, able to fight and kill animals much larger than they are. Wolverines are dense and covered with shaggy fur, and because they resemble little bears, they're sometimes called "skunk bears." They weigh about 50 lbs. <i>Wolverine</i> was originally <i>wolvering</i>, which may come from the plural form of <i>wolf</i>, <i>wolves</i>, or possibly from <i>wolver</i>, "one who behaves like a wolf."</p></div></div>`;
