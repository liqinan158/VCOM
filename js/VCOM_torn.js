Things can be literally <i>torn</i>, like a <i>torn</i> piece of paper, or figuratively <i>torn</i> â€” like your <i>torn</i> heart when you have to take sides in a family feud.</p><p class="long">You can serve a salad full of torn lettuce leaves, or mend a stuffed animal with a torn ear. In both cases, something has been divided by force, or pulled apart. It's also possible to be emotionally torn, or conflicted between two choices, options, or people: "I'm <i>torn</i> between going to the party or staying home and reading my library book." Either way, torn things are difficult (and sometimes impossible) to repair.</p></div></div>`;
