An <i>egomaniac</i> might only take photos of himself — never of another person.</p><p class="long">Just because you like to take selfies doesn't make you an egomaniac — a true egomaniac has a psychological disorder that makes him believe that he is the greatest, most important person in the world. You can also use the word to describe someone you know who's a self-centered jerk, though. <i>Egomaniac</i>, coined in the early 19th century, combines <i>ego</i>, "the self," or in Latin, <i>I</i>, and <i>maniac</i>, from the Greek <i>mania</i>, "madness or frenzy."</p></div></div>`;
