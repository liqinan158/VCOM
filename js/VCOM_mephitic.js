If you accidentally combine ammonia and bleach when you're cleaning, you will make a <i>mephitic</i> cloud of gas that is not only smelly but is also dangerous to breathe.</p><p class="long"><i>Mephitic</i> comes from the Latin word <i>mephitis</i>, which means noxious vapor or exhalation. Mephitis was also the name of the Roman goddess of foul-smelling gases from volcanoes and swampy areas. She loans her name to the very common North American striped skunk, <i>Mephitis mephitis</i>. If you can remember the Latin name for skunk, you'll have no trouble remembering that <i>mephitic</i> describes air that smells terrible.</p></div></div>`;
