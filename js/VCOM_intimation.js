Your teacher's <i>intimation</i> that there could be a quiz the next day might send you into a panic, while your friend sitting beside you might not even notice.</p><p class="long"><i>Intimation</i> comes from the Latin word <i>intimationem</i>, which means an announcement. In English, <i>intimation</i> refers to a less direct form of communication. It's a suggestion or hint, rather than a blatant statement of fact. Your first intimation that your brother had a girlfriend was the amount of time he spent whispering into the phone. The second intimation was when he asked your parents for money for two movie tickets.</p></div></div>`;
