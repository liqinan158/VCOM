When the word is used as a verb, <i>excerpt</i> means to take a portion out, usually from a play, book, article, song, or other written work. And the part that is taken out also is called an <i>excerpt</i>, but it is a noun, that is, a thing. An excerpt is something you excerpt, or pluck out, from a larger piece.</p></div></div>`;
