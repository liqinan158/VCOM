The <i>Isle</i> of Capri, off the coast of Italy, is one of the most famous <i>isles</i> in the world.</p><p class="long">There is no clear agreement on what makes an island an isle. Some people say it's simply a matter of taste: isle sounds more poetic and romantic. Actually, there's no precise definition of island either, other than it's a piece of land surrounded by water and smaller than a continent. A good way to remember that an isle is a small island is that the word <i>isle</i> is smaller than <i>island</i>: this is a little word for a little thing.</p></div>`;
