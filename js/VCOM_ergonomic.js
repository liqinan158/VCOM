It can be considered important for everything from an office chair to a keyboard, as Designer Yves Behar commented that "Ergonomics is about design that treats the body well."  The word appeared in 1950, when the study of efficiency in the workplace became a science (even if your lumpy desk chair tells you otherwise).</p></div></div>`;
