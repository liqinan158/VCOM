An <i>angler</i> might fish off the end of a dock, or from a rowboat in the middle of a lake.</p><p class="long">Anglers are distinguished by the fact that they fish with metal hooks, and they often release the fish they catch. You can also call one type of fish an <i>angler</i>, short for <i>anglerfish</i>, a big-headed, relatively small-bodied fish. <i>Angler</i> was originally a last name, and came to mean "fisherman" by about 1500, from the verb <i>angle</i>, "fish with a hook," from the Old English <i>angel</i>, which means "angle," but also "fishhook."</p></div></div>`;
