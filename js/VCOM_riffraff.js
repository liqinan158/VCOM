A snob might refuse to stay at a party if he thinks it's full of <i>riffraff</i>.</p><p class="long">You're only going to use <i>riffraff</i> in a joking way, unless you truly consider yourself part of a small, elite, superior segment of humanity. An obnoxious, arrogant character in a movie might tell her chauffeur, "Jeeves, pull around the corner. I don't want to walk through that crowd of <i>riffraff</i>." Before the fifteenth century, the term was <i>rif and raf</i>, which meant both "everybody," and "sweepings."</p></div>`;
