You’ve broken no laws, committed no sins, and are not guilty of any morally evil act.  Well done.</p><p class="long">In a courtroom, a defendant might announce their innocence, claiming they did not commit whatever crime they’re accused of.  Innocence is very important in many religions, where your moral purity decides what happens to your soul after you die.  The word comes from the Latin <i>innocentia</i>, which means “not harming” and someone with innocence will not harm themselves or others, at least not on purpose.  Remember that there are no <i>s</i>s in <i>innocence</i>, so spell it with two <i>c</i>s.</p></div></div>`;
