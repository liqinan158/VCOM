An entire kindergarten class might be <i>rubicund</i> after an hour spent running around the playground.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>rubicund</i> is a slightly old-fashioned way to describe someone who's ruddy-cheeked or who flushes easily. Your rubicund face might be evidence of the long hike you took earlier, or possibly give away your embarrassment at being unprepared for the speech you're about to give. The word comes from the Latin <i>rubicundus</i>, with its roots of <i>rubere</i>, "to be red," and <i>ruber</i>, "red."</p></div>`;
