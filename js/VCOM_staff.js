You might suspect that the town library's not a very fun place to work if its <i>staff</i> is always incredibly cranky every time you visit.</p><p class="long"><i>Staff</i> refers to all of the employees at a business, or especially a school, where the teachers as a group are called "the <i>staff</i>." A completely different meaning of <i>staff</i> is a long wooden stick or rod, particularly one that has a specific purpose — like a walking stick or a weapon. This is the original meaning of <i>staff</i>, from the Old English <i>stæf</i>. It wasn't until the nineteenth century that the word <i>staff</i> was used to mean "group of employees."</p></div></div>`;
