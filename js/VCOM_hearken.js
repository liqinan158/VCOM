In the Bible, prophets and saints are always telling people to <i>hearken</i> to their words.</p><p class="long">While <i>hark</i> is still used today, <i>hearken</i> is pretty much obsolete â€” unless perhaps you happen to be an old school preacher. <i>Hearken,</i> like <i>hark,</i> can also mean to look back to something in the past, though there is often a critical sense to the word. To hearken back to an old memory or event is usually to do it in a way that may be annoying to other people or perhaps even damaging or self-defeating to the one doing the hearkening. Frequently spelled <i>harken</i> in the US.</p></div>`;
