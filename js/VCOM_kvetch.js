It's an informal way to describe a very annoying activity, and you can also call the complaint itself a <i>kvetch</i>, as well as the person doing the complaining. In fact, this it the original Yiddish meaning, from <i>kvetshn</i>, "squeeze" or "press," which has a German root, <i>quetsche</i>, or "crusher."</p></div>`;
