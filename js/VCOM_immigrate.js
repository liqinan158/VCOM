During the great wave of immigration between 1880 and 1924, over 25 million Europeans <i>immigrated</i> to the United States.</p><p class="long">Many immigrants make significant contributions to their adopted countries. Consider Albert Einstein, the greatest physicist of the twentieth century, who immigrated to America from Germany, or the Russian-born New Yorker Irving Berlin, who wrote some of the most popular songs in the American songbook, including  “White Christmas” and “God Bless America."  The word <i>immigrate</i> comes from the Latin <i>imigrare</i>, which means “to move in.”</p></div>`;
