As the soul singer Edwin Starr asked, "<i>War</i>! Huh! What is it good for?" Absolutely nothing.</p><p class="long">The term "civil <i>war</i>" means not that the war is courteous and polite, but that it is between citizens of the same nation or community, as in the American Civil War. Often <i>war</i> refers to nonmilitary combat or tension, such as between angry neighbors, or rival sports teams, or between different social classes â€” as in "class <i>war,</i>" or government policies such as the "<i>war</i> on drugs."</p></div></div>`;
