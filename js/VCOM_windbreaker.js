You might want to grab your <i>windbreaker</i> before that boat ride â€” it gets chilly out on the water!</p><p class="long">The word <i>windbreaker</i> has been around since at least 1918, although originally it described a leather shirt worn as a wind-resistant layer. In some English-speaking places, it's more common to use the word <i>windcheater</i>. Today's windbreaker, generally made of light, synthetic materials, has evolved from wool or cotton versions that were popular in the mid-20th century. In fact, the John Rissman Company trademarked the word in the 1940s, calling their gabardine jacket "the only genuine Windbreaker."</p></div>`;
