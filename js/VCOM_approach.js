An airplane is cleared for a final <i>approach</i> just as the wheels <i>approach</i> the landing strip.</p><p class="long"><i>Approach</i> comes from the Latin word <i>appropriare</i> which means "go nearer to." You can physically approach something, like a waiter going to a table. Or, you can approach a subject, usually one you're a little nervous about â€” like a new employee might approach her boss about getting a raise. Time can also approach, like winter, midnight, or even old age.</p></div>`;
