It's usually short and adds a final embellishment beyond a natural ending point. Like this.</p><p class="long"><i>Coda</i> comes from the Latin word <i>cauda</i>, meaning "tail," and it's good to think of it as a tail tacked onto something that in and of itself is already a whole. If you tell a story about your crazy experience getting lost in the country and sleeping at a farmer's house, you might add, as a coda, that the farmer ended up visiting you too, a year later.</p></div></div>`;
