Most writers work hard to make the <i>lede</i> interesting and accurate.</p><p class="long">While this word is sometimes spelled <i>lead</i>, and either way rhymes with <i>reed</i>, it's especially common in American journalism to use <i>lede</i>. The phrase "to bury the lede" means to unwittingly neglect to emphasize the very most important part of the story â€” a no-no in journalism. The unusual spelling comes from an attempt to distinguish the word from the "metal" meaning of <i>lead</i>, which rhymes with <i>bed</i>.</p></div></div>`;
