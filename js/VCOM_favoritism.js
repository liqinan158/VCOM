Your grandmother practices favoritism if she clearly likes one of her grandchildren best, and a politician is guilty of favoritism if she gives tax breaks to one group but not to others. The word <i>favorite</i> is at the root of <i>favoritism</i>, from the Latin root <i>favere</i>, "to show kindness to."</p></div>`;
