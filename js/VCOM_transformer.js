Sometimes you can see a transformer attached to a utility pole on a residential street. The word <i>transformer</i> was coined in 1883 from the French <i>transformateur</i>, which in turn comes from the Latin <i>transformare</i>, "change the shape or form of." The prefix <i>trans</i>, or "across or beyond," gives a clue to this meaning.</p></div></div>`;
