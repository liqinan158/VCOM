An <i>armful</i> of wildflowers is probably enough to fill up a vase or two when you get home.</p><p class="long">An armful is an inexact amount, but a good way to describe the quantity of anything you can carry held against your body by your arms, or resting on your arms themselves. You might lug an armful of packages into the post office or leave an orchard with an armful of apples. The word <i>armful</i> dates from the late 16th century, from <i>arm</i> and the suffix <i>-ful</i>, "full of."</p></div>`;
