The Latin word was originally limited to written stories, but in English, <i>legend</i> lost that limitation. Often a legend lives on in the stories that people tell each other. A person can be a legend too. Anne Frank is a legend for keeping a diary of hidden life in war time, and a less famous person, like a long-serving local teacher, can be a legend to neighborhood kids.</p></div></div>`;
