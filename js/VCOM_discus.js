To throw it, an athlete spins around in a circle to "wind up" before flinging the discus as hard as she can. It must land in a certain area, and the thrower whose discus has traveled farthest wins. <i>Discus</i> means "disc" in Greek, and this sport was included in the original Ancient Greek Olympics.</p></div></div>`;
