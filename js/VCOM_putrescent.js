Ew!</p><p class="long">When things are putrescent, they're starting to become <i>putrid</i> â€” rotten and stinky. Everything that decomposes eventually becomes putrescent, from the remains of your lunch in your locker to the dead fish on a beach after a big storm at sea. This colorful way to say "spoiled" or "rancid" comes from the Latin <i>putrere</i>, "to rot," and its root, <i>putris</i>, "rotten or crumbling."</p></div>`;
