Your grandfather might knock the <i>dottle</i> from his pipe into the kitchen trash can every afternoon.</p><p class="long"><i>Dottle</i> is a very old-fashioned word that's specific to a fairly old-fashioned activity, pipe smoking. A well-packed pipe is meant to burn all the tobacco in its bowl, but sometimes there's a damp wad of smelly dottle left behind. The word, which is rarely used these days, was originally <i>dossil</i>, from the French word <i>dosil</i>, "a spigot or plug in a vessel." It became a pipe-smoking term in the early nineteenth century.</p></div></div>`;
