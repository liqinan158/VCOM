If you chose <i>deliberately</i>, you make a very conscious, well-thought-through choice.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>deliberate</i> ends with an "ate" sound — at the end of a trial, after the evidence is presented, the twelve members of a jury retreat to a room to deliberate, i.e., talk through the trial and come to a verdict. The adjective <i>deliberate</i> ends with an "it" sound. If you walk with a deliberate pace, you're slow and steady.</p></div>`;
