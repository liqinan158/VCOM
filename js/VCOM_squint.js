If you are trying to see something far away, you will probably <i>squint</i> while you strain your eyes to see more clearly.</p><p class="long">When the sun shines brilliantly through the car windshield, the driver will squint, or squeeze her eyes almost shut against the bright light. This is probably a good moment for the driver to grab her sunglasses! You'll squint when a light is suddenly turned on in a dark room, and you might also squint when you're trying to read tiny type on a food label or medicine bottle. The expression on your face, and the action of doing this, are both called a <i>squint</i> as well. <i>Squint</i> comes from the now rare adverb <i>asquint</i>, or "from the corner of the eyes."</p></div>`;
