Something similar to <i>due process</i> was established by the Magna Carta in Britain as far back as 1215, but while American law derived from British law there is now no exact equivalent in British law, whereas the rights represented by due process are now enshrined in the US Constitution. Weary homicide detectives break it at their peril.</p></div>`;
