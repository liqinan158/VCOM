If you take your dad's car without telling him, you can expect him to <i>censure</i> you severely, and maybe even ground you as well.</p><p class="long">The noun and verb are most closely associated with official expressions of disapproval, as when Congress censures a senator. The noun is from Latin <i>cēnsūra</i>, "censorship," from <i>cēnsor</i>, "an ancient Roman censor." The job of a Roman censor was to take the census and to supervise public morals and behavior. Our English word <i>censor</i> — which means to suppress speech or other forms of expression — is from this Latin word.</p></div>`;
