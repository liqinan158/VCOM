Well-balanced meals full of whole grains and vegetables are healthful. A good night's sleep and a long walk in the fresh air are both healthful, because they promote your good health. When you are full of health, however, don't use <i>healthful</i> to describe yourself â€” instead, use the closely related word <i>healthy</i>.</p></div></div>`;
