Even if you love to learn, the most <i>rewarding</i> part of going to school for many of us is making good friends.</p><p class="long">The word <i>reward</i> is obvious when you look at the adjective <i>rewarding</i>, and rewarding things do give you a kind of reward. Rather than cash for finding a neighbor's lost cat, though, the reward you get from something rewarding is pleasure or satisfaction. Watching a great movie is rewarding, and so is doing something kind for another person. You might even get lucky and have a rewarding career, or even a rewarding life.</p></div>`;
