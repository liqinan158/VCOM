var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">disruption</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>disruption</i> is a major disturbance, something that changes your plans or interrupts some event or process. A screaming child on an airplane can be a <i>disruption</i> of the passengers' sleep.</p><p class="long">A break in the action, especially an unplanned and confusing one, is a <i>disruption</i>. A sudden thunderstorm is an unwelcome disruption of an outdoor wedding ceremony, and a flat tire on an elaborate float will probably cause a parade disruption. When you <i>disrupt</i> something, you upset it or mess it up. In Latin <i>disrupt</i> means "broken into pieces," from <i>dis</i>, "apart," and <i>rumpere</i>, "to break."</p></div>`;
