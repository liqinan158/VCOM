Your favorite doughnuts might be <i>glazed</i> with icing, and your least favorite kind of road to drive on could be <i>glazed</i> with ice after a winter storm.</p><p class="long">Glazed pottery is coated with a smooth and gleaming layer. You can also use the adjective <i>glazed</i> to describe a person's emotionless or glassy eyes, or windows that are fitted with panes of glass. All of these meanings come from the verb <i>glaze</i>, a variation on the Middle English <i>glasen</i>, which means both "to fit with glass" and "to make shine."</p></div>`;
