If you dog runs away from you on the beach, you might find her by following her <i>footprints</i> in the sand.</p><p class="long">Your dad might scold you for tracking footprints across the clean kitchen floor â€” or you might hurry outside after a blizzard to be the first person in your neighborhood to make footprints in the fresh snow. A footprint is proof that you were there: similarly, a figurative kind of <i>footprint</i> is evidence of someone or something's presence or influence. For example, a company's "carbon <i>footprint</i>" is the amount of polluting greenhouse gas it emits.</p></div>`;
