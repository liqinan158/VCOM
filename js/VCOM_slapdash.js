If you make something in a <i>slapdash</i> way, you slap it together and then dash away â€” probably so no one would notice. If you want something to look great and last for a long time, then take your time and do it right. If you do it in a slapdash way, you may save time in the short run. But in the long run, you'll lose much more time redoing your shoddy work.</p></div>`;
