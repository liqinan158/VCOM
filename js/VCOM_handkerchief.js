You can also tuck a <i>handkerchief</i> in the breast pocket of a suit, or wear it tied jauntily around your neck.</p><p class="long">You can call a handkerchief a "hanky," or just a <i>kerchief</i>, although this more often means "a square piece of cloth worn as a head covering." This last part of <i>handkerchief</i> comes from the Old French <i>couvrechief</i>, literally meaning "cover head," from <i>couvrir</i>, "cover," and <i>chief</i>, "head." So a handkerchief is a similar cloth held in the hand â€” to mop your brow or wipe your eyes.</p></div>`;
