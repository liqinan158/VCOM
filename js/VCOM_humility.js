If you meet one of your heroes and feel nervous and in awe for her, you are experiencing <i>humility</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Humility</i> comes from the Latin word <i>humilis</i>, which literally means low. If you feel humility in front of someone, you feel small in the scheme of things â€” that you are just a simple, insignificant person. Someone who spends his life taking care of others shows humility. Although it's related to <i>humiliation</i> (which makes you feel low in a bad way), <i>humility</i> is usually used to talk about a lack of ego.</p></div></div>`;
