If you move to the <i>leeward</i> side of your sailboat, you're shifting to the sheltered, downwind side.</p><p class="long">You're likely to hear the word <i>leeward</i> when you're on a boat, since wind direction is hugely important when you're sailing. You can, however, use it to describe any area that's protected from the wind, even when you're on land. Your tent might fare best if you pitch it on the leeward side of a valley, for example. The <i>lee</i> part of <i>leeward</i> comes from the Old English <i>hleo</i>, which means "shelter, defense, or protection."</p></div>`;
