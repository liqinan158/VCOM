If your boss always asks you to pick up her dry cleaning and get her coffee, you might feel like you usually get the <i>demeaning</i> jobs.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>demeaning</i> comes from the verb <i>demean</i>, which itself is based on the construction of the word "debase." The word <i>demean</i> has two almost opposite meanings, to degrade and to conduct oneself in a particular manner, usually a proper one. The adjective, however, always describes something that is degrading. Overhearing two friends gossiping about you can be a demeaning experience, even if they're just criticizing your new haircut.</p></div></div>`;
