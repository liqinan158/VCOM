The word <i>sphere,</i> however, has much broader usage: we use it in to discussing astronomy, our earth, even our social rank (as in "one's <i>sphere</i> of influence"). <i>Spherical,</i> by contrast, has a much more limited use. It basically is a description of shape: if it's <i>spherical,</i> it simply looks like a ball.</p></div></div>`;
