Many <i>monks</i> live together in a religious community.</p><p class="long">To a greater or lesser extent, a monk has chosen to leave society and devote his life to prayer and service. In Eastern Orthodox Christianity, some monks pray unceasingly, while Buddhist monks often teach others, and Roman Catholic monks sing in choirs. In some cases, monks raise money for their churches by training dogs, baking bread, or even brewing beer. Originally, <i>monk</i> referred to men or women, though it's more common today to use <i>nun</i> for a woman.</p></div>`;
