This is one of the most basic human emotions, and it is not pretty. Don't be <i>jealous</i> of my good looks: you're cute too.</p><p class="long">Being <i>jealous</i> is among the least attractive things you can be. The word <i>jealous</i> is actually derived from a Middle English word related to <i>zealous</i>, which means emotionally intense. It conveys a sense of emotional pain at someone else's good fortune. <i>Jealousy</i> is a close cousin of <i>envy</i>, but it can also mean "fiercely guarding" â€” as in "I am jealous of the little money I've managed to make, so I'm not likely to blow it on a cheap toy."</p></div></div>`;
