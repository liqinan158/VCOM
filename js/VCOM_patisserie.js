Hungry for a croissant, an eclair, or some macarons? If there's a <i>patisserie</i> in your town, you're in luck!</p><p class="long"><i>Patisserie</i> is a French word that means "pastry shop," from a Latin root that translates as "composed of paste," which makes more sense when you know that <i>paste</i> meant "dough" before it meant "glue." In French-speaking countries, it's spelled with a circumflex accent: <i>p√¢tisserie</i>. You can also use this word to describe French cakes and sweets in general: "Their selection of patisserie is really impressive, and I love their pain au chocolate!"</p></div>`;
