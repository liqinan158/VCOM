Anything <i>detrimental</i> hurts, hinders, or puts a damper on something. <i>Detrimental</i> things do damage.</p><p class="long">Have you ever heard "Smoking may be detrimental to your health" and wondered what it meant? It means that smoking is bad for your health: it's going to harm you in a bunch of ways. <i>Detrimental</i> is a more official, formal way of talking about things that do harm. A dog who likes digging holes can be detrimental to a garden. If you're writing a paper and want to pick an alternative to <i>harmful</i> that sounds more formal, <i>detrimental</i> is a great choice.</p></div>`;
