You've probably seen it in movies. It's the part where an official charge is read and the accused responds by saying "guilty" or "not guilty."</p><p class="long"><i>Arraign</i> comes from Old French, but it traces back to the Latin <i>ad</i>, meaning “to,” and <i>ration</i>, meaning “reason or account.” So if you arraign someone, it’s like you're presenting an account — a record — of the thing the person has done wrong. You're outlining a formal charge in court. <i>Arraign</i> can also be used more broadly to describe any accusation of wrongdoing.</p></div>`;
