The first meaning is one you might encounter in algebra class: a binomial has two terms. Often binomials are in parentheses, and they always have two parts: (X-Y) is a binomial because of the two variables: X and Y. The other type of binomial can be found in biology class: a two-part name that belongs to the system of distinguishing individual biological species, like <i>canis familiaris</i>: a dog.</p></div>`;
