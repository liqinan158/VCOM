If you're trying to convince your friends to play poker with you, you might <i>downplay</i> the fact that you're an experienced and competitive player.</p><p class="long">Politicians who depend on contributions from oil and gas companies tend to downplay the environmental effects of their products, and a boy who wants a trampoline for his birthday might downplay the possible dangers when he talks to his parents about it. <i>Downplay</i> is a relatively recent addition to the English language, dating from the late 1960s.</p></div></div>`;
