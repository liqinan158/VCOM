You can <i>insist</i> that you didn't eat the last piece of cake, and then <i>insist</i> that your brother show your mom the bits of frosting on his fingers.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>insist</i> comes from the Latin <i>insistere</i>, meaning “persist,” “dwell upon,” or “stand on.” To insist on something, like a room with a view, is to say that you must have it. To insist that you never met that man before in your life — even though there's a picture of the two of you together — is to claim that you're telling the truth. To insist on tapping your foot on the chair leg is annoying.</p></div></div>`;
