An <i>auger</i> is a hand tool with a long blade that looks sort of like a screw, which drills holes when turned.</p><p class="long">An auger is typically used to drill holes in material such as wood, soil, or ice. When you turn the auger, the blade digs into the material and slowly shaves away a thin layer, eventually creating a hole. Think of it as working like a drill — only you’re the one supplying the power. A special kind of auger made out of a long coil of wire can be used to clear clogs out of drains or pipe</p></div>`;
