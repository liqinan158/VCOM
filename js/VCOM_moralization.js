If you judge other people's moral decisions, acting as if you're an expert on what's right and what's wrong, you are engaging in moralization of the most annoying kind. We can trace <i>moralization</i> back to the Latin root <i>moralis</i>, "proper behavior of a person in society."</p></div></div>`;
