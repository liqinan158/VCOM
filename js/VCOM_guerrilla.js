In Spanish, <i>guerra</i> means "war" and <i>guerrilla</i> means “little army.” Guerrilla fighters tend to work in small groups and use ambush and sabotage to surprise stronger, more traditional forces. You might have heard of Che Guevara, a famous guerrilla fighter who was involved in the Cuban Revolution.</p></div>`;
