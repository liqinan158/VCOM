You might plan to <i>jollify</i> with your friends on Saturday night in honor of your upcoming birthday.</p><p class="long">When you have a lively party or a festive celebration of any kind, you jollify. Some people jollify just because it's the weekend, while for others it takes a special occasion to really let go and jollify. While the noun <i>jollification</i> is still occasionally used these days, it's rare to hear someone use the 1800's verb <i>jollify</i>. Both words stem from <i>jolly</i>, which has an Old French root, <i>jolif</i>, "festive, merry, or pretty."</p></div></div>`;
