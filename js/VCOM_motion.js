The ball rolling down a hill is in <i>motion</i>, and as Isaac Newton once proved, it will remain in <i>motion</i> until it hits a wall or something else that makes it stop.</p><p class="long">When <i>motion</i> is used as a noun, it describes movement, like the <i>motion</i> that propels a car from one end of the highway to another. When used as a verb, <i>motion</i> means to signal or direct. "A restaurant patron will <i>motion</i> to the server when he's ready for the check." Someone who is just "going through the <i>motions</i>" doesn't have to move at all, because they're just pretending.</p></div></div>`;
