A <i>lament</i> is full of regret and grief.</p><p class="long">If you lament something, then you feel sorry about it. You could lament a mistake you made, or you could lament a horrible thing that happened to a friend. Also, a lament is an expression of grief. So if you keep saying how sorry you are about something, someone could say, "Enough of your <i>laments</i>!" There's also an old literary form called "a <i>lament</i>," which expresses feelings of loss in a long dramatic poem.</p></div>`;
