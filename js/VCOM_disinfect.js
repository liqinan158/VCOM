It's particularly important to <i>disinfect</i> cuts and scratches.</p><p class="long">You can disinfect your kitchen counters with cleaning products, or disinfect a scrape by washing it with soap and water. Public swimming pools have chlorine added to their water to disinfect them, and bleach is a good all-purpose chemical used to disinfect floors, laundry, and other things that might be harboring nasty bugs. <i>Infect</i> comes from a Latin root word, <i>inficere</i>, "to spoil or stain." Adding the prefix <i>dis-</i>, "do the opposite of," gives you <i>disinfect</i>.</p></div>`;
