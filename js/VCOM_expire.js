var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">expire</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If something — like milk or a free shipping coupon — <i>expires</i>, it is no longer usable or valid. When you <i>expire</i>, you will be dead.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>expire</i> comes from the Latin <i>expirare</i>, meaning “breathe out,” and the modern use retains that ancient meaning. The expanded, and more commonly used, meaning of <i>expire</i> is that the breath has — literally or figuratively — departed. When you expire your breath, you breathe out; you exhale. Things with a limited shelf life sometimes offer an expiration date that lets you know when they will expire: yogurt, frozen burritos, and even contracts for temporary employment. But some things expire in their own time: life, love, and car batteries.</p></div>`;
