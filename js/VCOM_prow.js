When Leonardo DiCaprio declared himself “King of the World” in the movie <i>Titanic</i>, he was standing on the prow of the doomed ship.</p><p class="long"><i>Prow</i> came into English from the Greek word <i>prōira</i>, from a base meaning “in front.” <i>Prow</i> typically refers to the front part of a ship — the pointy bit that cuts through the water. You might see the prow of a ship approach the harbor through the fog. You can also use <i>prow</i> for things that look like the front of a ship, like the prow of a rock formation.</p></div></div>`;
