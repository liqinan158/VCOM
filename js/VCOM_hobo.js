No one is certain where the word came from, although there are a couple of educated guesses. One possible origin is the English word <i>hawbuck</i>, which means "country bumpkin," while another is the common working man's greeting or call during the building of the railroads in the West, <i>ho, boy!</i></p></div>`;
