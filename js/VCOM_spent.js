Almost everyone feels completely spent after climbing a mountain or running a marathon.</p><p class="long">When you're spent, you've used up your reserves of energy, and when a physical item is spent, it's outlived its usefulness. Spent fuel, for example, has been burned and can no longer power a machine, and a rocket might power a space shuttle until it's spent and falls away. The adjective <i>spent</i> comes from the verb <i>spend</i>, "to pay out," which has the Latin root <i>expendere</i>, "to pay down."</p></div>`;
