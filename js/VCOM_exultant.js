var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">exultant</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the adjective <i>exultant</i> to describe the triumphant feeling you get when you succeed at something. The kids who win the Little League championship game will be <i>exultant</i>.</p><p class="long">The kid who's elected sixth grade president will feel exultant, and so will a singer who's just given the performance of her lifetime. <i>Exultant</i> describes an excitement that's a combination of pride, happiness, and triumph. The word <i>exultant</i> comes from the Latin <i>exsilire</i>, "to leap up," from the prefix <i>ex-</i>, "up or out," plus <i>salire</i>, "to leap." In other words, when you're exultant, you're jumping for joy.</p></div>`;
