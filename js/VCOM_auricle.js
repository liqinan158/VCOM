It's more common to call an ear <i>pinna</i>, or the external part of the ear, an auricle, although it's occasionally also used to refer to an <i>atrium</i> of the heart. The word comes from the Latin <i>auricula</i>, "ear," with the heart meaning stemming from the ear-like shape of the heart's upper chambers.</p></div>`;
