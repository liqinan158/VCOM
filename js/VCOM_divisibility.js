If you've learned basic rules of <i>divisibility</i> in math class, you know that all even numbers can be evenly divided by 2.</p><p class="long">In math, <i>divisibility</i> refers to a number's quality of being evenly divided by another number, without a remainder left over. You can easily see the divisibility of 40 by 4, for example. The divisibility of a large piece of land means that it can be broken into smaller parcels to be sold separately, and the divisibility of a pan of brownies is clear when you slice into it and dole out equal portions to all of your friends.</p></div>`;
