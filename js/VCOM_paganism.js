Any religion that’s outside of the mainstream is considered <i>paganism</i>. Wiccans and Druids are but a few of the people who practice <i>paganism</i>, but many pagan religions have been retired.</p><p class="long">Paganism is a loose term that lumps together many religions and belief systems. This term was often used in a derogatory way — especially by Christians — for faiths that existed before Jesus. The term <i>pagan</i> is related to the Latin word for “rural” because country people held on to the old religions for longer. In paganism, polytheism — a group of gods — was more common than the monotheism that followed. Paganism is also called heathenism.</p></div>`;
