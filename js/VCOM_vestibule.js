You often find <i>vestibules</i> in churches, because they help keep heat from escaping every time someone enters or exits.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>vestibule</i>, pronounced "VES-tih-bule," probably comes from the Latin word <i>vestibulum</i>, which means “entrance court.” From about 1880 to 1930 vestibules were popular features in new homes because they create an additional barrier that keeps heat or cool air in and street noise out. If you have a vestibule, you can hang coats and leave shoes and gloves there instead of bringing them into the living room, kitchen and so on.</p></div></div>`;
