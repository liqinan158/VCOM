After learning about the <i>pitiable</i> conditions of schools in parts of rural India, you might decide to donate supplies to them.</p><p class="long">Just looking at <i>pitiable</i> gives you clues to its meaning. <i>Pity</i> is a feeling of sorrow for someone or something else, so something that's pitiable is worthy of pity. There's often a little bit of scorn thrown in, like the pitiable amount of cereal your stingy grandmother pours in your bowl at breakfast. In this case, there's some blame cast on the grandmother because she chooses to give so little cereal.</p></div>`;
