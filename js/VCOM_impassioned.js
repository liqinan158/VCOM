Anything can be <i>impassioned</i> â€” speech, a play, a conversation, a novel, or even you.</p><p class="long"><i>Impassioned</i> comes from the Latin word <i>passionem</i>, meaning "suffering or enduring," and originally referred to the suffering of Christ on the cross, known as "The Passion." In other words, <i>impassioned</i> had a sense of trauma and anguish associated with it and only later did it come to describe happier feelings as well. Whatever the emotional feeling behind <i>impassioned,</i> it's still a word that suggests profound feeling and sincerity on behalf of the user.</p></div></div>`;
