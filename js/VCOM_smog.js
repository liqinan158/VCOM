There are other culprits for smog, though, including coal-burning factories, other chemical emissions from plants and mills, and nearby forest fires. If there's too much smog in a city, it can make it hard for people with asthma to breathe.<i>Smog</i> is a great example of a <i>portmanteau</i>, a word formed by combining two other words into one: it comes from <i>smoke</i> and <i>fog</i>.</p></div>`;
