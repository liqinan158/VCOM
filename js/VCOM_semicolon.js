This means wherever there's a semicolon, it can be replaced with a period; however, this results in more abrupt, shorter sentences. You can also usually replace a semicolon with a comma followed by a conjunction like <i>and</i>, <i>for</i>, or <i>but</i>. The first printed semicolon appeared in 1494.</p></div>`;
