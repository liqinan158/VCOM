It's cute when a little kid <i>peddles</i> his homemade birthday cards around the neighborhood, but if an adult did that it might be annoying.</p><p class="long">The classic image of someone who peddles is an old-fashioned "peddler" or "tinker" traveling from village to village selling goods. The verb <i>peddle</i>, in fact, comes from the word "peddler," whose origin is a mystery. Any time you sell something by going from place to place, like selling Girl Scout cookies to all your neighbors, you peddle.</p></div></div>`;
