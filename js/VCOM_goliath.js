var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">goliath</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Someone or something with an unusually large amount of strength is a <i>goliath</i>. Your soccer team might be nervous if you show up to a game and the other team's players are a bunch of <i>goliaths</i>.</p><p class="long">This adjective comes from the Biblical figure Goliath, who despite his greater size and strength was defeated by the young David. So while it's fine to use <i>goliath</i> to simply mean "giant" or "strong person," it's even more fitting for something supposedly strong and unbeatable that's actually vulnerable. You might challenge a goliath of a developer that's threatening to cut down the oldest maple tree in town â€” and, like David, you just might win.</p></div></div>`;
