If your teacher reads your poem in front of the entire class, you may feel proud â€” or you might be <i>acutely</i> embarrassed.</p><p class="long">In medicine, <i>acutely</i> is used to emphasize the seriousness of a condition or injury: "She is acutely allergic to antibiotics, so be sure to write that on her chart." Otherwise, you can use this adverb for anything that's especially vivid, like when you're acutely aware that everyone in the room is staring at your purple hat, or intensely unpleasant, like your little brother's acutely annoying whine.
