Believe it or not, every single particle of matter in the universe exerts <i>gravitation</i> on every other particle.</p><p class="long">The terms <i>gravitation</i> and <i>gravity</i> are often used interchangeably for the attraction between everything with energy or mass. While gravity is specifically the pull of an object toward the Earth, gravitation describes this fundamental force more generally. Sir Isaac Newton's 17th-century Law of Gravitation states that "every particle attracts every other particle in the universe with a force directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them."</p></div></div>`;
