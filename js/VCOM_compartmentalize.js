Sometimes people <i>compartmentalize</i> their feelings in order to understand them better.</p><p class="long">Someone who compartmentalizes his own life tends to sort its different parts, keeping work life completely removed from recreation or family life, for example. A college student might find that a good way to prepare for a history exam is to compartmentalize each decade and study them separately. The verb <i>compartmentalize</i> comes from the noun <i>compartment</i>, itself from the Old French <i>compartiment</i>, "part partitioned off," from the Late Latin <i>compartiri</i>, "to divide."</p></div></div>`;
