Military members and police officers sometimes use respirators known as "gas masks" to protect themselves from fumes emitted during wars and riots. Some respirators simply purify the air that moves through them, while others, like those used in hospitals, provide oxygen. The Latin root of <i>respirator</i> is <i>respirare</i>, "breathe in and out."</p></div>`;
