As its name suggests, a <i>teapot</i> is a vessel in which you brew tea. "Tip me over and pour me out!"</p><p class="long">To make tea, put loose tea or tea bags in a teapot and fill it with very hot water. After the tea steeps, you can pour it into cups. The very first teapots were made in China, and historians believe that tea was drunk directly from the spout, rather than being poured into a cup for drinking. These earliest teapots were made of metal. In the 17th century, porcelain teapots became more common.</p></div></div>`;
