A <i>keg</i> typically holds less than thirty gallons.</p><p class="long">Bars and pubs have plenty of kegs, each containing different brands and types of beer, and occasionally they'll also have kegs of root beer or other soft drinks. When a large quantity of carbonated liquid is needed, a keg works well because it keeps its contents under pressure. The original kegs were made of wood, and in addition to beverages, they also held things like gunpowder and nails. <i>Keg</i> comes from the Old Norse <i>kaggi</i>, "cask or keg."</p></div></div>`;
