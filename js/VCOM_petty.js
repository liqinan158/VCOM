If you host world leaders and spend more time picking napkins than memorizing names, you're focused on <i>petty</i> things.</p><p class="long">A few neutral meanings of <i>petty</i> are still in use today — such as "petty cash," which refers to a small amount of cash on hand — but most uses of <i>petty</i> since the 16th century are negative, as in "narrow-minded," "trivial," and "of little importance." A "petty argument" is a popular expression, because many people get all worked up over something that isn't very important — a petty concern — that seems much smaller after the heat of the moment.</p></div></div>`;
