If the movie version of your favorite book leaves out the most exciting plot line, it's because the director made an <i>elision</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Elision</i> has its roots in the Latin word <i>elidere</i>, which means "to crush out." A government censor who blacks out the names of people or places in a document is making an elision, and so is an editor who removes passages from an article to make it shorter or clearer. The editor probably thinks of the elision as a clean, businesslike cut, but the writer might indeed feel crushed.</p></div></div>`;
