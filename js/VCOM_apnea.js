One symptom of this kind of <i>apnea</i> is excessive snoring.</p><p class="long">The most common type of apnea is "sleep <i>apnea</i>," which affects both adults and children and can result in as many as 30 breathless episodes per night. Many people with this kind of apnea don't know they have it. Scientifically, any instance of not breathing is considered apnea â€” whether you're holding your breath or being choked. The Greek root of <i>apnea</i> is <i>apnos</i>, "without breathing," from <i>a-</i>, "not," and <i>pnein</i>, "to breathe."</p></div>`;
