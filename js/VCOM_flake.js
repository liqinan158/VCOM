There are also croissant flakes, dandruff flakes, and of course snow flakes, individual snow crystals. When something <i>flakes</i>, it comes off in tiny flecks: "The paint had started to <i>flake</i> off the kitchen wall." If someone calls you a <i>flake</i>, they basically mean you're a weirdo.</p></div>`;
