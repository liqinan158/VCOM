While some people take <i>valerian</i> to help them sleep, there's no real scientific evidence that it works.</p><p class="long">Although scientists doubt the sedative effects of the dried valerian plant, it's been used in natural medicine since ancient Greece. Over the years, valerian has been cited as a cure for ailments ranging from liver problems, croup, the plague, and even "envy of the elves"! Today people usually take valerian for sleeplessness or tension, although studies haven't confirmed those effects. While the valerian plant grows pretty little flower clusters, it's considered an invasive weed in much of North America.</p></div>`;
