You can lean over <i>sideways</i> to see if your cat's hiding under the bed, or tip a teapot <i>sideways</i> to pour the last drops out.</p><p class="long"><i>Sideways</i> works as an adjective or adverb to describe things that lean toward one side or at an angle. A sideways tilt to a motorcycle might look scary, but it's safe if the rider is experienced. You can also use this word figuratively for "indirect" or "unconventional." So you might describe a movie that approaches serious subjects from a sideways perspective, using comedy. <i>Sideways</i> dates from the mid-16th century.</p></div>`;
