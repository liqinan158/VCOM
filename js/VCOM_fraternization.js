Your field hockey coach may discourage <i>fraternization</i> with the opposing team.</p><p class="long">Some fraternization is innocent, friendly fun, like the fraternization you do after work with your co-workers, people you wouldn't necessarily socialize with if you didn't happen to work together. There's also "fraternization with the enemy," which has a more sinister, treasonous implication, particularly in the military or government. The word <i>fraternization</i> comes from the Latin word for "brotherly," <i>fraternus</i>.</p></div></div>`;
