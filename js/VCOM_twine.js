It can be used to stake plants in the garden or to tie up a package of cheese from a deli. <i>Twine</i> can also be a verb meaning "to twist around," the way threads are twisted into a strand of twine. Your cats might twine around each other to sleep, for example. The Old English version was <i>twin</i>, or "double strands of thread."</p></div>`;
