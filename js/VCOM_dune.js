It's a good idea to bring plenty of water and a camel if you're trekking across sand <i>dunes</i> in the Sahara.</p><p class="long">Sometimes people drive special vehicles on the dunes beside the ocean â€” these are sometimes called "<i>dune</i> buggies." These seaside dunes are formed by a combination of wind and water, while the dunes in a desert are purely the result of wind. The origin of the word <i>dune</i> is somewhat uncertain, although it probably comes from a French word with an older Germanic root.</p></div></div>`;
