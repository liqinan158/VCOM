This is because its root is the word <i>deserve</i>. <i>Deserts</i> most often follows the word <i>just</i>, to mean that someone gets the reward or punishment he or she really deserves to get. The bully who is expelled from school gets her just deserts, for example, and so does the brilliant scientist who wins the Nobel Prize.</p></div>`;
