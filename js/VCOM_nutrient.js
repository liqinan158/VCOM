We humans get our <i>nutrients</i> from what we eat, plants get theirs from the soil. While the best <i>nutrients</i> are natural, we can also get them from vitamins in a bottle.</p><p class="long">The words <i>nutrient</i> and <i>nourish</i> both come from the Latin word <i>nūtrīre</i>, "to feed, nurse, support, preserve." Although usually used as a noun, the word <i>nutrient</i> started out in 1650 as an adjective meaning "providing nourishment." It's important to your health to get the proper nutrients, so the food pyramid was developed by nutritionists to show you the balance of foods you need each day.</p></div>`;
