But say you left your pointy goading stick at home. Have no fear! You can goad people with words, too. Literally or figuratively, a <i>goad</i> prods and pokes and provokes people into doing something. A sheep herder might hustle his flock along with a goad, just as your mom's constant nagging and goading might finally get you sit up straight at the dinner table.</p></div>`;
