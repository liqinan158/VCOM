In fact, Old French and Latin define <i>pendere</i> as "hang." Think of other words you know that are like <i>suspended</i>, such as that word's other definition, "to put off temporarily." A student suspended from school has not been kicked out, but instead is left hanging between periods of enrollment. Then there is <i>pending</i>: a decision that is pending hasn't been made yet, so people wait, hanging on until they know what will happen.</p></div></div>`;
