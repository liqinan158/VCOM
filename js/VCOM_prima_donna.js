If you tirelessly dominate the conversation and always interrupt when other people are talking, people will think you're a <i>prima donna</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Prima donna</i> is a term that comes from the Opera, and literally means first woman, in Italian. Because the ladies that starred in operas were often egotistical, demanding, and flamboyant, the term <i>prima donna</i> came to mean anyone who acted as if they were a world-famous talent. The term is not an insult if you're talking about an actual opera star, but if anyone else is called a prima donna, it means they're terribly vain.</p></div>`;
