Like a runway model strutting to the end of the catwalk, <i>posing</i> with her hands on her hips, and then gracefully walking back.</p><p class="long">The original meaning of <i>pose</i> from the 14th century is "to put in a certain position." The sense of pose as "to assume a certain attitude" emerged in the 1850â€™s. When a person <i>poses</i>, he presents himself in a particular way, often with the hope of impressing others. But if you're just posing objects, then the word loses the negative connotation.</p></div></div>`;
