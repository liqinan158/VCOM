The <i>fragility</i> of your grandmother's juice glasses might make you nervous about taking even one sip.</p><p class="long">An object's fragility makes it likely to get broken or damaged, and a person's fragility means that he's not physically strong. New parents are often worried about the fragility of their newborn baby, and being sick can emphasize a person's fragility. Another way to use the word is to mean "vulnerable" or "sensitive." When something's delicate or frail, you can call it <i>fragile</i>, and both words stem from the Latin root <i>fragilis</i>, "brittle or easily broken."</p></div>`;
