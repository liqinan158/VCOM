A sparkly, sequined dress that's really shiny but not very well made has <i>glitz</i>, but it may not be the most tasteful outfit for your grandparents' anniversary party.</p><p class="long">The decorating committee for a high school prom might be aiming for sophistication and end up with glitz, with spangles and glitter that's all a bit too much. If someone talks about the "<i>glitz and glamour</i>" of a party, the guests' clothes were probably pretty flashy. In Yiddish, <i>glitz</i> means "glitter," from the German root <i>glitzern</i>, "sparkle" or "glittering." In English, <i>glitzy</i> came first, probably influenced by the word <i>ritzy</i>.</p></div></div>`;
