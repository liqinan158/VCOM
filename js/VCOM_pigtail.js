Although pigs only have one, <i>pigtails</i> often come in pairs.</p><p class="long">Some people think pigtails and braids are two different hairstyles (and often, a single pony tail to be a third), but others just call them all pigtails. The word, an American invention, originally described a twisted piece of chewing tobacco that was thought to resemble a pig's curly tail. The hairstyle was first called <i>pigtails</i> in the mid-1700s.</p></div></div>`;
