Some <i>soundtracks</i> are composed and recorded especially for a film, while others are made up of many songs by different musicians.</p><p class="long">TV shows and video games often have soundtracks too, although the concept started with films. During the silent film era, musicians would sometimes play live music to accompany a movie screening. The origin of the term <i>soundtrack</i> goes back to approximately the same time that the first "talkie," or film with sound (1929's "The Jazz Singer"), was screened for audiences. A recorded album featuring the music from a movie is also called a <i>soundtrack</i>.</p></div>`;
