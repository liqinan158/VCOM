He's definitely not a wimp. Men admire him and women want to be with him. Superman is one guy who could easily be described as <i>virile</i>. The Man of Steel, with his muscles rippling under the "S" emblazoned on his costume, has superhuman strength and charm. That's why Lois Lane can't keep her eyes — and hands — off him.</p></div></div>`;
