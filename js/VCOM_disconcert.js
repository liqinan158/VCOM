var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">disconcert</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>disconcert</i> is to unsettle someone, or make them feel confused and out of sorts. Finding a soup ladle in your sock drawer would definitely <i>disconcert</i> you!</p><p class="long"><i>Disconcert</i> comes from the old French word <i>disconcerter</i>, meaning "confused."  The prefix <i>dis</i> means "not" â€” it has a bad attitude and shows up in words like <i>disagree</i> and <i>disown</i>. The second part of the word comes from the verb <i>concerter</i>, "to bring together." If you disconcert someone, you make them feel uncomfortable and maybe a little embarrassed.</p></div>`;
