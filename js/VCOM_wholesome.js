Hopscotch is in most cases a <i>wholesome</i> game, since you can't get into much trouble while hopping up and down on the concrete.</p><p class="long">Wholesome foods are the ones that your body appreciates, the ones that help you stay healthy. Marshmallows and corn chips aren't what you'd call wholesome, but organically grown fruits and vegetables are. Wholesome can also apply to other things. If you project a <i>wholesome</i> image, other people see you as a decent, moral person, somebody who's trustworthy and not living a secret life of crime. The word <i>wholesome</i> comes from the Old English <i>hal,</i> meaning "healthy."</p></div>`;
