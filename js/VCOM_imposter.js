Someone who tries to convince you that he's your long lost cousin in order to get an invitation to stay in your awesome apartment is an <i>imposter</i>.</p><p class="long">An imposter usually seeks some kind of financial gain when he or she assumes another person's identity, but there can be other motivations, like simply the thrill of doing it. Any imposter who pretends to be the sibling of a famous person, for instance, will get lots of attention. The Latin root is <i>impostorem</i>, "impose upon or deceive." It's more commonly spelled <i>impostor</i>, although both spellings are correct.</p></div>`;
