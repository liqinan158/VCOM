You might consider your cousin as your <i>relation</i>, and you might have strained <i>relations</i> with him over your grandmother's estate.</p><p class="long">The way that one thing affects another is their relation like the relation between childhood poverty and poor nutrition, for example. You can also call your relative a relation, as when you describe your great-grandfather as your oldest living relation. The phrase <i>no relation</i> means that even though two people share the same last name, they are not related — or aren't relations.</p></div>`;
