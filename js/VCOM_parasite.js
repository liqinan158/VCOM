The <i>parasite</i> might not hurt the host, but it doesn't do anything to help it, either.</p><p class="long">If you call someone a <i>parasite</i>, you are really hurling an insult! The Ancient Greeks used the word <i>parasitos</i> to describe someone who ate at your table but never invited you back. Some telling synonyms include <i>leech</i>," <i>toady</i>, <i>sponge</i>, and <i>hanger-on</i>." Nice, huh? Some crafty birds, such as the cowbird or cuckoo, are called social <i>parasites</i>, laying their eggs in other birds' nests and expecting those mamas to raise their young for them. Unfortunately, there are some people like that, too.</p></div>`;
