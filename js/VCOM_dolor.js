Your sad-eyed dog might express a great deal of <i>dolor</i> when you leave him alone for the day.</p><p class="long">You can use <i>dolor</i> to talk about heartache or sadness, like the dolor of guests at a funeral or a winter sky's gray dolor as the days get shorter. No matter how you use the noun <i>dolor</i>, it's going to have a poetic sound to it. It's more common to come across the adjective <i>dolorous</i>, or "full of sorrow." In Latin, <i>dolor</i> means "pain or grief."</p></div>`;
