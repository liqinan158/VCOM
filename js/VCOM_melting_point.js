The <i>melting point</i> of water is 32 degrees Fahrenheit — that's the temperature at which your ice cubes start to dissolve in your soda.</p><p class="long">For most substances, the melting point is identical to the freezing point. When heat is added, ice begins to change to water at 32 degrees — and that's also where water changes to ice as the temperature drops. It's a state of equilibrium between solid and liquid forms. The melting point of steel is 2750 degrees, and lead's melting point is 621.5 degrees. You may feel you've reached your own melting point on a hot August day, but physicists would disagree.</p></div>`;
