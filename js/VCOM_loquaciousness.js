Your friend's <i>loquaciousness</i> is much more charming during a dinner party than first thing in the morning, when you're still half asleep.</p><p class="long">If people comment on your loquaciousness, it means they think you talk a lot. Loquaciousness comes in handy when you're making small talk at a party or filling air time on your local radio talk show. If you have the quality of <i>loquaciousness</i>, you're <i>loquacious</i>, which comes from the Latin <i>loquax</i>, or "talkative," ultimately from the root word <i>loqui</i>, "to speak."</p></div></div>`;
