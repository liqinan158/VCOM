If <i>golf</i> seems too difficult, you might try taking up miniature <i>golf</i> — with a short course and whimsical obstacles — instead.</p><p class="long">Scotland is famous for its golf courses, and in fact the game was invented there during the 15th century. <i>Golf</i> comes from the Scottish <i>gouf</i>, an alteration of the Middle Dutch <i>colf</i>, "bat or club." The first known printed use of the word <i>golf</i> was in a statute banning the game — King James II believed that archery was more important and that golf was a distraction. Later monarchs enjoyed the game and lifted the ban.</p></div>`;
