If your teacher has <i>exacting</i> standards about spelling and punctuation, you better carefully check your final paper.</p><p class="long">An exacting person expects things to be, well, exact. For this reason, <i>demanding</i> is a good synonym. Friends who are exacting might let you have it if you show up a minute or two late. Some exacting people are extremely selective about what they eat, rejecting anything that doesn't meet their complicated standards of nutrition and taste.</p></div>`;
