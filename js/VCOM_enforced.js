The <i>enforced</i> rules at your school are the ones that the teachers make sure all students stick to and follow.</p><p class="long">One way to remember that <i>enforced</i> means "required" or "compelled" is to think of rules being "in force." It's almost always laws, rules, or standards that are enforced — enforced parking regulations, for example, are rules that will earn you a ticket if you don't follow them. The adjective <i>enforced</i> comes from the verb <i>enforce</i>, which originally meant "strive or attempt," and later "compel" or "exert force." The Old French root is <i>enforcier</i>, "strengthen," and also "oppress."</p></div></div>`;
