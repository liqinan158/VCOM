We can also say that someone is <i>free</i> of pain, which means they have none.</p><p class="long">This word has many meanings. On Mondays, admission to some museums is <i>free</i> â€” there's no charge. Often, people say the best things in life are <i>free</i>, usually meaning love and friendship. We live in a free country, which means we have a lot of rights and freedoms, such as freedom of the press. The word has a similar meaning when we say a prisoner goes free, or philosophers talk about free will: the belief that we make our own decisions, not ones forced on us by society, culture, or a higher power.</p></div></div>`;
