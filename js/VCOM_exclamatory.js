Your grandmother might give an <i>exclamatory</i> cry when you arrive at her house unannounced.</p><p class="long">You can express exclamatory praise for a movie you absolutely loved, or give an exclamatory gasp when you walk into your own surprise party. When something's exclamatory, it's like an <i>exclamation</i>, or a "sudden cry of emotion." Both words come from the Latin <i>exclamare</i>, "to call out," which consists of the prefix <i>ex-</i>, "out," and <i>clamare</i>, "cry or shout."</p></div>`;
