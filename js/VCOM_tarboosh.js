A more common name for a tarboosh is <i>fez</i>, though the two words can be used interchangeably. In the United States, it's not unusual to see members of the Shriners organization riding tiny cars in parades, and they almost always wear tarbooshes on their heads. The word comes from the Arabic <i>ṭarbūš</i>, which is rooted in the Persian word for "head covering," <i>sarpūš</i>.</p></div></div>`;
