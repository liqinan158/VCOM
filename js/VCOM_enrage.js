People are not typically <i>enraged</i> by annoying things like paper cuts or long lines. They are more likely to become <i>enraged</i> by evil or injustice.</p><p class="long">Something that enrages you makes you incredibly angry. The news that their favorite teacher has been fired might enrage a group of students, and witnessing someone mistreating an animal might also enrage them. The 14th century verb <i>enrage</i> combines the prefix <i>en-</i>, "make or put in," and <i>rage</i>, with its Latin root <i>rabies</i>, "madness, rage, or fury."</p></div>`;
