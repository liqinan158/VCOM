Digits are your fingers, so someone skilled at prestidigitation has some tricky fingers. One of the most famous prestidigitators in modern history was Howard Thurston, especially known for card tricks. In his most famous trick, audience members would pick cards from a deck. Thurston would place the deck in a glass on stage, and then he would make the chosen cards rise from the glass while he was still in the audience. That's impressive prestidigitation!</p></div>`;
