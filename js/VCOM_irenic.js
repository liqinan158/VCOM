Although you and your sister constantly fought as young children, your relationship might become more <i>irenic</i> as you grow older.</p><p class="long">The word <i>irenic</i> is from the Greek word <i>eirēnē</i>, which means peace. Eirene was the Greek goddess of peace. She was one of the Horae, or Hours, and she also represented the season of spring, so she is often depicted holding a full cornucopia. Today, the adjective <i>irenic</i> still maintains its peaceful meaning, and governments are continuously searching for irenic solutions to world problems.</p></div></div>`;
