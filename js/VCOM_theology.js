Of course, religion isn’t simple, so theology covers a lot of subjects, like rituals, divine beings, the history of religions, and the concept of religious truth.</p><p class="long">Theology is taught to priests and ministers so they can better understand their religion, and it’s also taught in non-religious colleges to anyone who is curious about the ideas and effects of religion.  The first half of <i>theology</i> is <i>theo</i>-, which means <i>god</i> in Greek. The suffix -<i>logy</i> means “the study of,” so <i>theology</i> literally means “the study of god," but we usually expand it to mean the study of religion more broadly.</p></div></div>`;
