A place can be <i>glacial</i> — like the South Pole — but a person can be <i>glacial</i>, too, like that unfriendly girl who gave you a <i>glacial</i> stare.</p><p class="long">The word <i>glacial</i> is related to the word <i>glacier</i>, which is a huge piece of ice. If something or someone is glacial, that thing or person is icy. You can give someone you don’t like a glacial look, or you can go skiing on a glacial morning. <i>Glacial</i> comes from the Latin <i>glacies</i>, which sounds like the name of a frozen dessert, but which actually just means "ice."</p></div>`;
