In fact, in computers, a <i>vector</i> is a method used to propagate a computer virus. However, the word <i>vector</i> is also used in various scientific areas, including mathematics, where it indicates something possessing both size and direction; and aeronautics, where it indicates a projectile's course.</p></div>`;
