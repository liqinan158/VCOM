Your mom might think it's funny to yell, "<i>Sally forth</i>!" when it's time to catch the bus for school.</p><p class="long">The phrase <i>sally forth</i> is a somewhat old-fashioned way to say "embark" or "get going." It comes from the primarily military noun <i>sally</i>, which has been used since the 16th century to mean "a sudden springing forth of besieged troops to defend against attackers." These days, most people use this phrase in a joking way: "Let's put on our costumes and sally forth for trick-or-treating!"</p></div>`;
