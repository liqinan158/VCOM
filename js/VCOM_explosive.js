You might use an <i>explosive</i> to create a tunnel through a mountain â€” but you probably shouldn't use one to clear weeds from your yard.</p><p class="long">Explosives contain highly reactive chemicals that are full of potential energy, which can be released with a bang. You can also use the word <i>explosive</i> as an adjective, to describe such substances or anything else that is dramatic, abrupt, or loud. You might say that your brother has an <i>explosive</i> temper sometimes, or that your snow shoveling business has seen explosive growth this winter. The Latin root is <i>explodere</i>, "drive out."</p></div></div>`;
