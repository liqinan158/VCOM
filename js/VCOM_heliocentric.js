Since our solar system is <i>heliocentric</i>, the Earth revolves around the sun (and not the other way around, as people in the Middle Ages believed).</p><p class="long"><i>Heliocentric</i> has been used since the late 17th century — though Copernicus theorized that the planets revolve around the sun, rather than around the earth, in the early 1500s. Religious scholars objected strongly to this idea, and there was general resistance for over 100 years, until the science of a heliocentric model finally won out. The Greek roots of <i>heliocentric</i> are <i>hēlios</i>, "sun," and <i>kentrikos</i>, "pertaining to a center."</p></div></div>`;
