When you <i>relay</i> the information that your pet monkey is known to attack people to your neighbors, you should bring a basket of muffins.</p><p class="long"><i>Relay</i> comes from the French <i>relayer</i>, which means "to change hounds on a hunt." It still has that sense of something passed in motion. You might run a relay race â€” each team member carries a baton part-way, then passes it on. We relay news, as when you take a message from Sally and relay it to Harry. A fresh work crew is a relay, and so is an electrical switch that can turn a second circuit on.</p></div></div>`;
