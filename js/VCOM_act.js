A commercial that says "<i>Act</i> now!" means "Get up from the couch and order me! This minute!"</p><p class="long"><i>Act</i> is both a noun and a verb. You can perform an act of kindness or violence. Or, you can act in a play. People who take on roles and perform them are actors. Likewise, plays, operas, and ballets are broken down into acts. You may have seen references to Shakespeare's plays, such as "Act I, Scene IV." Comedians refer to their shows as acts. Other performers, from magicians to lion tamers, sometimes do the same: a magic act is a magician's show.</p></div>`;
