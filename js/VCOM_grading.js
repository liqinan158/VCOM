var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">grading</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When your teacher stays up until four in the morning assigning scores to student work, that's the <i>grading</i> of papers. <i>Grading</i> can also mean smoothing a surface, as in <i>grading</i> a lawn before planting seeds.</p><p class="long"><i>Grading</i> comes from the verb <i>grade</i>, which basically means "group by category." When a teacher works on the grading of papers, she's dividing them into groups — the A's go together, the B's and so on. Fruit grading works in the same way, as does meat — you can have meat where the grading is "prime," or meat with a grading of "Grade A." <i>Grading</i> also has to do with the idea of gradual change — a steep slope could be said to have steep grading.</p></div>`;
