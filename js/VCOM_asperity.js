Did your supervisor snap “Late again!” when you showed up 20 minutes after your shift was supposed to start? She's speaking with <i>asperity</i>.</p><p class="long">The harshness that <i>asperity</i> implies can also apply to conditions, like "the asperities of life in a bomb shelter." The word can be used even more literally to refer to surfaces, as in "the asperity of an unfinished edge." But, most often, you will see <i>asperity</i> used in reference to grumpy voices or irritable behavior.</p></div>`;
