Another kind of disinterest is more of a neutrality or impartiality. A mediator, judge, or negotiator needs this type of disinterest in order to hear two opposing viewpoints without prejudice. <i>Disinterest</i> comes from the prefix <i>dis-</i>, "lack of," and <i>interest</i>, from the Latin <i>interresse</i>, "to concern, make a difference, or be of importance."</p></div></div>`;
