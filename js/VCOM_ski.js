You can also cross country ski, or move across flat, snowy ground and gentle hills on skis. The special boots that skiers wear are called ski boots, and you also need a ski helmet and ski goggles when you go skiing. In its earliest English use, the word was spelled <i>skee</i>, and it's rooted in the Old Norse <i>skið</i>, "long snowshoe."</p></div>`;
