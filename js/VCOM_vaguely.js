If you <i>vaguely</i> recall meeting someone once before, you barely remember him or her, what you talked about, or even where you met.</p><p class="long">The adverb <i>vaguely</i> probably comes from the Latin word <i>vagus</i>, which means “wandering,” or “uncertain.” Its origin is unclear, which is fitting for a word that means "mistily." If you don't want to go to your friend's tuba recital, you can say vaguely, "I think I might have something else to do that night. But if I don't, I'll try to make it."</p></div>`;
