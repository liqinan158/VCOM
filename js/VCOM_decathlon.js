If you want to compete in a <i>decathlon</i>, you need to be very strong as well as a fast runner.</p><p class="long">The word <i>decathlon</i> comes from two Greek words, <i>déka</i>, or "ten," and <i> áthlon</i>, "prize or contest." Competing in a decathlon typically takes two whole days, during which athletes compete against each other in shot put, pole vault, high jump, javelin, discus, and long jump, as well as four running races. The winner of a decathlon is traditionally given the title of "World's Greatest Athlete."</p></div></div>`;
