People at New Year's parties often mark the stroke of midnight by tossing <i>confetti</i> into the air.</p><p class="long">It's traditional to throw rice at the newly married couple after a wedding ceremony, but sometimes guests throw confetti instead. Other places you might see (or throw) confetti are parades, game shows, sporting events, and parties.
