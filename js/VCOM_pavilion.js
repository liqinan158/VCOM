A traveling circus takes place under a big colorful <i>pavilion</i> or billowing tent. A wedding might take place under a <i>pavilion</i> or freestanding decorative building in a garden.</p><p class="long">The word <i>pavilion</i> comes from the Latin <i>papilionem</i> meaning "tent" or literally "butterfly." Think of the sweeping beautiful wings of a butterfly and how they sort of resemble the folds of a tent. In the eighteenth century, pavilions were popular in Europe.  Wealthy people would build these small temple-like buildings where they could go to reflect and find calm.  Today, the word is more commonly used for big tents or outdoor spaces where events are held.</p></div></div>`;
