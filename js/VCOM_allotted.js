Hopefully you will be happy with your <i>allotted</i> share of candy on Halloween.</p><p class="long">Something that's allotted is distributed, or shared, like your allotted number of pizza slices. It can also mean your share of a job; on family clean-up day, your allotted task could be taking out the garbage. The Germanic word <i>loter</i>, "lot" or "share," is at the root of <i>allotted</i>. <i>A</i> plus <i>loter</i> form the Old French <i>aloter</i>, "to divide into lots." When you're spelling <i>allotted</i> remember to double up the <i>l</i>s and the <i>t</i>s.</p></div>`;
