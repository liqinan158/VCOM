If you buy a fancy new house, expect a phone call from the local charity with a solicitation for a donation.</p><p class="long"><i>Solicitation</i> comes from <i>solicit</i>, which means "to request," or "to entreat." So solicitation is the act of requesting. There are three kinds of solicitation. One is asking for money, like when someone goes door-to-door trying to collect money for a cause. In law, solicitation means encouraging someone to commit a crime. Solicitation can also mean making a plea to someone with power to grant a request or favor, like your solicitation to the traffic judge to dismiss your ticket.</p></div>`;
