Custom, tailor-made, or bespoke clothing is the exact opposite â€” they're constructed to perfectly fit your body. Ready-made food is store-bought, and made commercially, not homemade. You can also use this adjective to describe something that's so quick and automatic it's become a cliche, like a politician's thoughtless, ready-made response to a reporter's question.</p></div></div>`;
