Your <i>facial</i> expression is the smile — or frown — that you happen to be wearing on your face.</p><p class="long">Your facial features are made up of your eyes, nose, mouth, cheeks — everything that together comprises your whole face. When you use the word <i>facial</i> as a noun, it means a spa treatment that usually includes a deep cleaning and moisturizing of the face. You might decide to get a massage and a facial at the fancy resort hotel where you're spending a relaxing week. The Medieval Latin root is <i>facialis</i>, "of the face," from <i>facies</i>, "figure, appearance, or countenance."</p></div></div>`;
