You can wash your windows without one, but a rubber-edged <i>squeegee</i> makes cleaning a lot easier (and more fun â€” because you get to say the word <i>squeegee</i>).</p><p class="long">The word <i>squeegee</i> first appeared among sailors, describing a leather-edged device for cleaning a ship's deck. In 1851's <i>Moby Dick</i>, there is a reference to a "leathern squilgee." The word probably comes from the now-obsolete verb <i>squeege</i>, "to press." This tool eventually evolved into the rubber and metal (or plastic) version we know today, used for printing, photography, and window cleaning.</p></div>`;
