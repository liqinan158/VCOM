The <i>mutuality</i> between you and your co-workers at the ice cream shop means there's good communication and a sense of understanding.</p><p class="long">You could also use the term <i>reciprocity</i> or <i>cooperation</i> instead of <i>mutuality</i>. There's an inherent sense of give-and-take or respect when there's mutuality in a relationship. The word comes from <i>mutual</i> and its original definition, "given and received in a reciprocal way." If you have a relationship that works well, whether it's with your favorite teacher or your best friend, it's undoubtedly because of mutuality.</p></div>`;
