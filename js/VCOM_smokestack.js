If you look at Google Images for the word "pollution," you'll see lots of pictures of <i>smokestacks</i> spewing thick, gray smoke.</p><p class="long">The main difference between the words <i>chimney</i> and <i>smokestack</i> is that you're more likely to call the flue on top of your house a <i>chimney</i>, saving <i>smokestack</i> for more industrial uses. Steam locomotives used smokestacks to release smoke and steam â€” the exhaust from the train's smokebox. Without the smokestack, the pressure would become dangerously high inside the train, causing it to explode.</p></div>`;
