If your boss asks you to work over 40 hours one week, that's <i>overtime</i> and you should demand extra pay.</p><p class="long">You can use this word as a noun or an adjective, as in <i>overtime</i> pay or <i>overtime</i> hours. At some workplaces, working overtime earns you more than the normal hourly salary. In other cases, full time employees are expected to work overtime without any extra pay. In sports, <i>overtime</i> is when play goes longer than the usual time â€” more than nine innings in a baseball game, or more than a twenty-minute half in basketball, for example.</p></div></div>`;
