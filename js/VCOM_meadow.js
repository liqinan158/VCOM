It can also refer to a piece of land found along a river.</p><p class="long">The word <i>meadow</i> refers to any grassland or hayfield, often just an expansive area that should be mowed. Indeed, the word comes from the Old English word <i>mæd</i> from the Germanic <i> mædwon</i> the base of which means “mow.” Still, the bucolic feeling is retained, as Dale Carnegie put it: “Let us not get so busy or live so fast that we can't listen to the music of the meadow or the symphony that glorifies the forest."</p></div>`;
