You can describe the Little Italy neighborhood of your city as microcosmic of the country of Italy, for example, or the dynamics of a preschool classroom as microcosmic of adult society. In fact, sociology — the study of how people act in societies — is where you're most likely to come across the adjective <i>microcosmic</i>. The word is rooted in two Greek words, <i>mikros</i>, "small," and <i>kosmos</i>, "world."</p></div></div>`;
