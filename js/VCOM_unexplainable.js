var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">unexplainable</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Unexplainable</i> things are puzzling and impossible to solve. Some people describe <i>unexplainable</i> lights in the night sky as UFOs.</p><p class="long">If you can't think of a good reason for your bad mood, it's unexplainable. And when you experience a strange coincidence, like running into a friend who you were just thinking about, that's also unexplainable. At the heart of this word is <i>explain</i>, from the Latin root <i>explanare</i>, "to make clear or make plain." <i>Unexplainable</i> adds the "not" prefix <i>un-</i> and the suffix <i>-able</i>, which expresses ability or capacity. Scramble those word parts together, and you've got a word meaning "not able to explain."</p></div></div>`;
