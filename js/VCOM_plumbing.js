A home's heating system often consists of plumbing too. The work of fixing or installing this type of system is also plumbing. The word's earliest meaning was "the weighting of a fishing line," from <i>plumb</i>, originally "to sink like lead," which has the Latin root <i>plumba</i>, or "lead."</p></div></div>`;
