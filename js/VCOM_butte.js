There are many <i>buttes</i> in the Southwest and Western United States.</p><p class="long">The dramatic hills in the background of old Western films are often buttes â€” the director John Ford featured Arizona's Mitten Buttes in seven of his movies. Geographers distinguish between a butte and a <i>mesa</i>, a larger, flat-topped hill: a butte's top is narrower than it is tall, and a mesa's is wider than its height. The explorers Lewis and Clark are responsible for introducing this French word to English speakers.</p></div>`;
