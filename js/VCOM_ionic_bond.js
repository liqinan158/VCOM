When a positive and a negative ion form a chemical bond, it's an <i>ionic bond</i>.</p><p class="long">You're likely to come across the term <i>ionic bond</i> in chemistry class. It's the bond that's formed during the process of one atom losing an electron — becoming negatively charged — and another gaining an electron — becoming positively charged. This is also known as an <i>electrovalent bond</i> or an <i>electrostatic bond</i>. The adjective <i>ionic</i> comes from the noun <i>ion</i>, an electrically charged atom, which means "go" in Greek.</p></div></div>`;
