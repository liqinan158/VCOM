This ancient source never meant "doing yoga poses," but referred to a deeply mystical practice. In India, a yogi can be a spiritual practitioner of various kinds, but in the West, it's come to refer to someone who does physical yoga <i>asanas</i>, or poses with names like "cat," "cow," and "downward dog."</p></div>`;
