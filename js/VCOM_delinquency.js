Cutting class all week to drive around town without your license is a sure sign of <i>delinquency</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Delinquency</i> can mean a particular violation, like stealing a car, but it may also refer to a more general trend of acting out and violating the law, like stealing cars daily and crashing them many times over. In this sense it’s often called <i>juvenile delinquency</i>. Another sense of <i>delinquency</i> is general neglect, particularly by someone who holds a formal position. The word can also refer to an unpaid debt. You’re thinking about those unpaid library fines now, right?</p></div></div>`;
