You might <i>chatter</i> with your workmates about the weather or where you'll eat lunch.</p><p class="long">You probably chatter with your friends all the time without even thinking about it, gossiping or talking about unimportant things. You can call the talk itself <i>chatter</i> too: "The <i>chatter</i> in the cafeteria was so loud I couldn't hear myself think." In the 13th century, it was <i>chateren</i>, from an imitative Middle English root.</p></div>`;
