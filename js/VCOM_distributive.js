In the winter during cold season, a teacher becomes a <i>distributive</i> source of facial tissue for all the students.</p><p class="long">The word <i>distributive</i> may come from the late Latin <i>distributivus,</i> which means "divided up." <i>Distributive</i> has another meaning, which concerns the sales of goods to companies or consumers. For example, if stores run out of pink sweaters for a month while more pink sweaters sit idle in warehouses, the pink sweater industry probably has a distributive problem.</p></div>`;
