When you're on <i>jury duty</i>, you have a responsibility to contribute to a verdict in a legal case.</p><p class="long">Have you ever wondered how people end up on a jury? The answer is simply that it's their turn for jury duty. When a citizen gets a notice that they've been called for jury duty, they are legally obligated to serve, unless they have a very good excuse. Being called for jury duty doesn't always mean you'll be on a jury, thought, since potential jurors are questioned by the attorneys first and may be dismissed for a variety of reasons.</p></div>`;
