When an artist paints a large white lily to represent death and a small dog to symbolize loyalty, she's using <i>iconography</i>.</p><p class="long">Whenever someone uses a familiar symbol or image to represent a particular person, group, characteristic, or theme, they're using iconography. In art, iconography sends specific messages, like when a lamb in a religious painting represents Jesus. In politics, iconography can convey things like strength and patriotism through flags, stars, and other symbols. The root of this word is the Greek <i>eikon</i>, which means "image or picture," but also "an image in the mind."</p></div>`;
