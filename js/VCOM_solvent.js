As a noun, <i>solvent</i> is either a certain kind of chemical or an idea that solves a problem. As an adjective, <i>solvent</i> describes someone who's got cash on hand.</p><p class="long">A solvent dissolves other chemicals, which is why it's also easy to remember: <i>solvent</i> is a chemical used to dis<i>solve</i> other chemicals. The adjective <i>solvent</i>, on the other hand, comes from a French verb that means "loosen." In these tough economic times, only those banks that are solvent are in a position to loosen the cash flow and start lending money. No cash? You're not solvent.</p></div></div>`;
