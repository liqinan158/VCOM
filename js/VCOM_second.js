If you ask whether you're <i>second</i> in line, the hostess might reply, "Give me a <i>second</i> and I'll tell you."</p><p class="long">Different meanings of the word <i>second</i> have evolved from the same background, which is the Latin word <i>secundus</i>, which means "next" or "following." Many of the meanings of <i>second</i> follow that idea of a linear "next," including "second base" (comes after "first base").  Back when duels were commonly fought, each dueler chose a second, a friend whose job it was to see that the fight followed the rules.  You might have second thoughts about entering a duel, and rightfully so.</p></div>`;
