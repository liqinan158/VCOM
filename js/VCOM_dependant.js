You'll most often find this spelling in British English, where it's favored (or favoured!) in using the word as a noun.</p><p class="long">Don't be confused by the spelling. In the UK, the <i>-ant</i> ending often shows up for the noun but not the adjective. In the US, the <i>-ent</i> ending is more popular for both the noun and adjective. Either way, this word has to do with reliance. Kids are dependants (or dependents) of their parents, which means they <i>depend</i> on them for food and shelter.</p></div>`;
