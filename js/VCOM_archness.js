If your philosophy professor cracks a lot of jokes during her lecture on ethics, you might comment on her <i>archness</i>.</p><p class="long">If you like romance novels simply to make fun of their silly plots and overblown characters, your archness might offend a friend who actually enjoys the books. When you're <i>arch</i>, you tease in a fake or exaggerated way. The noun <i>archness</i> comes from <i>arch</i>, which meant "chief or principal" in the 1500s but grew by the mid-seventeenth century to have a more derogatory meaning after being a familiar prefix for words like <i>rogue</i> and <i>knave</i>.</p></div></div>`;
