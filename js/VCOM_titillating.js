For your book report, your English teacher will probably make you read a serious novel rather than a <i>titillating</i> romance.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>titillating</i> implies a certain cheap or fleeting kind of excitement. Titillating things are unimportant and entertainingâ€”maybe even a little bit lewd. The word comes from the Latin word <i>titillationem</i>, "a tickling," and its root <i>titillare</i>, " to tickle," which imitates the sound of giggling.</p></div></div>`;
