To <i>ambush</i> your enemy, hide and wait for him to come near and then pounce on him.</p><p class="long">In war or in backyards, an ambush is a great way to surprise someone.  <i>Ambush</i> comes from a Latin word meaning “to place in a wood,” and hiding in the woods behind a tree is a classic starting point for an ambush.  The actual attack is called an ambush, but <i>ambush</i> is also a verb, so you can ambush your mom by dropping water balloons on her head from a tree.  Please don’t tell her where you got that idea.</p></div></div>`;
