As a verb, <i>seed</i> means "remove the <i>seeds</i> from," so you can seed a lemon or a pomegranate (and in the latter case, you can then eat the seeds you've seeded). You also seed when you scatter seeds in a garden. Figuratively, <i>seed</i> is often used to mean "provide money to start a business" or "help something grow."</p></div>`;
