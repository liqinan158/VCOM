Your <i>bipedalism</i> means you stand upright on two legs â€” it also means that you skip, run, dance, and tiptoe using two feet.</p><p class="long">This word's roots go back to the Latin <i>bi-</i>, "two," and <i>ped</i>, "foot." Bipedalism is any kind of movement involving two feet, and animals that get around this way are described as <i>bipedal</i> or called <i>bipeds</i>. As human ancestors evolved, bipedalism became a big advantage, allowing us to grab things with our hands as we stood and walked around on our feet. Other animals that use bipedalism include ostriches, bears, and some apes.</p></div>`;
