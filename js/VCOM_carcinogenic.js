var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">carcinogenic</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Something is <i>carcinogenic</i> if it has the potential to cause cancer. Asbestos, a material that was frequently used for insulation, was found to be <i>carcinogenic</i>, leading to laws regulating its use.</p><p class="long">To correctly pronounce <i>carcinogenic</i>, accent the fourth syllable: "car-sih-nuh-JEN-ick." <i>Carcinogenic</i> is related to the noun <i>carcinogen</i>, meaning "a cancer-causing substance." Both words come from <i>carcinoma</i>, or "malignant tumor" and <i>-gen</i>, a suffix that means "something produced." So something that is carcinogenic produces malignant tumors â€” cancer.</p></div></div>`;
