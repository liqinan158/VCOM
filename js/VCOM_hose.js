You may use a <i>hose</i> to water your lawn, or to get gas from the pump into your car's tank.  Don't use a <i>hose</i> to ingest liquids; use a glass instead.</p><p class="long">A garden hose is useful for watering plants or washing your car, while firefighters use hoses to spray water on fires. A hose is similar to a pipe, being long, narrow, and hollow, with space for liquid to move through it, although a hose is flexible, and a pipe is commonly made of stiff metal or hard plastic. You can use the word as a verb, meaning "to spray with a <i>hose</i>," or as a noun meaning "sheer stockings."</p></div>`;
