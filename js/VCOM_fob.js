If your grandfather carries his watch around in a little pocket in his vest, it's probably attached with a <i>fob</i>.</p><p class="long">It's uncommon to see a watch fob these days, but they were once as ordinary as the watches they held. The little pockets sewn in men's clothing were also <i>fobs</i>, and today, a key chain is sometimes called a <i>fob</i>. When <i>fob</i> is a verb, it means to fool people or play a trick on them, especially by giving them something less valuable than they expect. This meaning is from the obsolete <i>fobbe</i>, "cheater."</p></div></div>`;
