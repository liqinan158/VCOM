Your father might be the <i>patriarch</i> of your family, but your kid brother could be the <i>patriarch</i> of his club house.</p><p class="long">You can trace <i>patriarch</i> back to its ancient Greek root <i>pater</i> meaning "father." What do you think a female leader is called? You got it â€” <i>matriarch</i>. Although the noun <i>patriarch</i> specifically refers to a male head of the family, it can more generally refer to any older, respected male. In terms of the Old Testament, <i>patriarch</i> refers to the men considered to be the fathers of the human race, including Jacob and Isaac.</p></div></div>`;
