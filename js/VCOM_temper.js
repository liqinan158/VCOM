If you’re not sure whether you have a <i>temper</i>, ask your friends — but don’t get mad if you dislike what they have to say.</p><p class="long"><i>Temper</i> has a number of related yet distinct meanings. In addition to describing a tendency to anger, <i>temper</i> can also refer to one’s mood in general; if you use the word in this sense, you might describe someone's temper as "angry" or "mild." <i>Temper</i> can also be used as a verb meaning “to restrain.” If you have a nasty temper, you might try tempering your temper by counting to ten whenever you’re tempted to throw a "temper tantrum," or fit.</p></div>`;
