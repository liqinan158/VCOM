Soldiers might take part in a <i>covert</i> mission to infiltrate an enemy camp â€” and you might take part in a <i>covert</i> mission to steal your brother's leftover Halloween candy.</p><p class="long"><i>Covert</i> is the opposite of <i>overt</i>, which means obvious, or in full view. Covert things are hidden, private, or stealthy. It comes from the Old French <i>covert</i>, or "covered." A covert bag of chips you've snuck into the movie theater might literally be covered, hidden under your coat, while a covert plan to throw your dad a surprise party is just a secret.</p></div>`;
