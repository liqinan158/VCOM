Synthesizers can mimic the sound of a saxophone, drums, hand claps, or even an orchestra's entire string section. Some synthesizers even let you play a recorded sound and then manipulate it so it sounds just the way you want it to. <i>Synthesizer</i> comes from <i>synthesize</i>, "combine two or more things," and its Greek root <i>synthesis</i>, "a putting together."</p></div>`;
