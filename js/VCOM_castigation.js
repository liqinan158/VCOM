A <i>castigation</i> is a harsh verbal reprimand.</p><p class="long">No one likes to be on the receiving end of castigation. The word comes from the Latin <i>castigus</i> which means "to make pure." Try to remember during castigation that the castigator is, in their own misguided way, trying to make you a better person. But that may be hard to think of when someone is bawling you out.</p></div>`;
