To <i>appraise</i> something is to figure out its worth in the marketplace, on the field, or in the world of ideas.</p><p class="long">To appraise the value of a friendship is difficult, but to appraise the value of your grandfather’s pocket watch — just go to the pawn shop. The verb <i>appraise</i> comes from the Late Latin word <i>appretiare</i>, which means “value” or “estimate.” You can appraise your chances of marrying royalty, which are probably slim. You can also appraise the value of a quarterback on your fantasy football team by looking at the statistics for his completed passes.</p></div></div>`;
