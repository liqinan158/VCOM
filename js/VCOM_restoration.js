A crumbling house that is lovingly-rebuilt in its original style, a king who was kicked off his throne only to get it back â€” these are <i>restorations</i>.</p><p class="long">Notice the difference between <i>renovation</i> and <i>restoration</i>. If you restore a 1950s house, you use period materials and effects. A renovation might include new things. <i>Restoration</i> always means a putting back: if you've been ill, but get better, you might talk about your restoration of health.</p></div>`;
