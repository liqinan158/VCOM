Your business trip, when you spent most of the week waiting in airports and adjusting to different time zones, does not count as an <i>excursion</i>.</p><p class="long">The Latin root for <i>excursion</i> is <i>excurrere</i>, meaning "to run out." So if you run out for a bit to get some fresh air, you've gone on an excursion. If you leave specifically to buy milk from the corner store and end up swimming in a stream, you've probably taken an excursion into the woods.</p></div></div>`;
