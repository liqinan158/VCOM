A peace treaty between warring nations is a kind of <i>rapprochement</i>.</p><p class="long">People who usually get along sometimes come into conflict: formerly allied nations go to war, friends feud, and spouses divorce. If a conflict ends and the parties go back to being on good terms, they achieve rapprochement. This term is most often used in international politics â€” for example, when two countries make peace after a long war, that's rapprochement. The word means "reunion" or "reconciliation" in French, and its root is <i>rapprocher</i>, "to bring near."</p></div>`;
