It's less neighborly to leave your barking dog tied up all night right outside your neighbors' bedroom window, or to have loud parties without inviting your downstairs neighbor. <i>Neighborlike</i> was once more commonly used than <i>neighborly</i>, and both come from Old English roots, <i>neah</i>, "near," and <i>gebur</i>, "dweller."</p></div>`;
