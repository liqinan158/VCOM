Some believe that it traces back to the German word <i>mahhon</i>, meaning "to make." True or not, it’s a good way to remember the meaning of <i>mason</i>: masons make things out of brick or stone. A mason is a skilled craftsperson who might, for example, carve stone for a memorial or do work on the brick walls of a house.</p></div>`;
