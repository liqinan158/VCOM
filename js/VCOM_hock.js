If you are hard up for cash, you may need to <i>hock</i> that ham <i>hock</i> for a few bucks. Good luck!.</p><p class="long">An animal's hock is the rough equivalent to a human's ankle. A horse's hock is easy to see: it's the joint above the hoof that's angled backwards. Other mammals (especially those with long legs) also have hocks, including dogs and pigs. In the case of a pig, the word <i>hock</i> is more commonly used to describe a cut of meat from the animal's leg â€” a "ham <i>hock</i>." When <i>hock</i> is a verb, it usually means "pawn," or "leave an item in return for a loan of money."</p></div></div>`;
