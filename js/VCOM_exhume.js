Chances are he’s only digging up potatoes — when you <i>exhume</i> something, it means you’re digging up a corpse.</p><p class="long">The word <i>exhume</i> traces back to the Latin word <i>exhumare</i>, a combination of <i>ex-</i>, meaning “out of,” and <i>humus</i>, or “ground.” That meaning holds true today: when you exhume something, you dig it up out of the ground. The word almost always applies to the removing of a previously buried corpse, such as law enforcement officials who exhume a body to perform an autopsy or collect evidence related to an investigation.</p></div>`;
