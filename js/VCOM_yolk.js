If you order eggs "sunny side up," those "suns" are the egg <i>yolks</i>.</p><p class="long">When a bird lays an egg that's fertilized and begins to grow into a baby bird, the yolk is the substance that nourishes the bird embryo. The eggs we eat have yolks too, but since they are unfertilized, these protein-rich yolks can be beaten into omelettes or mixed into cake batter. The Old English root of <i>yolk</i>, <i>geolca</i>, literally means "the yellow part."</p></div></div>`;
