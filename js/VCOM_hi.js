When you walk down the street in a small town, it might seem like everyone you pass says "<i>hi</i>."</p><p class="long">The word <i>hi</i> is a good, nearly all-purpose greeting â€” it's appropriate in all but the most formal circumstances, so you might want to skip saying, "<i>Hi</i>" to the Queen when you meet her. When you greet someone, you have a lot of words to choose from, including "hey," "hello," "hiya," and "howdy," but <i>hi</i> is probably the most common. The first mention of <i>hi</i> attributes it to a Kansas native American in the 1800s.</p></div>`;
