You might walk very carefully down the street in your new red cowboy boots, being careful not to <i>scuff</i> the toes.</p><p class="long">You can scuff a floor by moving heavy furniture, or scuff your new leather backpack by dragging it on the sidewalk. It's easy to scuff new shoes or to scuff your dad's car interior when you try to cram your bike into its hatchback. <i>Scuff</i> also means to drag your feet, the way a reluctant child might do on her way into the dentist's office. The word <i>scuff</i> is Scottish, possibly from a Scandinavian root.</p></div></div>`;
