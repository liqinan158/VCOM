It takes two strong people to carry a patient on a <i>stretcher</i>.</p><p class="long">Although the words are sometimes used interchangeably, a stretcher is different from a <i>gurney</i>, which is fitted with wheels and can be moved by a single person. Stretchers are more portable and tend to be used in emergency situations, especially on battlefields and in wilderness search-and-rescue operations. When an artist, (rather than a doctor or ambulance driver) uses the word <i>stretcher</i>, they generally mean "wooden frame on which a canvas is stretched for painting."</p></div></div>`;
