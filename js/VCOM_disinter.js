A vampire sleeps all day in his own coffin and then disinters himself at night to go in search of blood. One way to remember the meaning of <i>disinter</i> is to think of "dis-entering" a body. When someone dies, their body is "entered" into the grave. If the body is removed, it's being "dis-entered," in a sense. But <i>disinter</i> is spelled — and pronounced — differently (diss-in-TUR), of course.</p></div>`;
