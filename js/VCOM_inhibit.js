If you put plants in a dark room, you <i>inhibit</i> their growth. A teacher who mocks their students for giving wrong answers <i>inhibits</i> their willingness to speak up in class.</p><p class="long">When you look at the word <i>inhibit</i>, think hinder. Though it sounds like it might be a bad thing to <i>inhibit</i> something else, there is no judgment built into the word. A drug that <i>inhibits</i> the growth of cancer cells would generally be considered a very good thing. While you may wish cancer cells to be <i>inhibited</i>, you probably don't wish it upon your friend's sense of humor or your country's economic growth.</p></div>`;
