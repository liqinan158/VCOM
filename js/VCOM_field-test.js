For example, if a drug company is developing a new medicine, they might first test it in a laboratory and then field-test it, having actual patients try it. Educators might field-test a new curriculum, and military planners often field-test weapons or vehicles before outfitting entire armies with them. In <i>field-test</i>, the <i>field</i> is the "natural location or context."</p></div>`;
