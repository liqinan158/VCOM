When the inside of your head feels this way — blurry, clouded, and vague — you can also used <i>foggy</i> in a figurative way: "Her memory grew <i>foggy</i> as the years went by." Experts aren't sure whether <i>foggy</i> or <i>fog</i> came first, but in either case they suspect a Scandinavian root.</p></div>`;
