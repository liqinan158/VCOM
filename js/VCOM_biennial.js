var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">biennial</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If you’re just as fanatical about the luge as you are about beach volleyball, you probably know that the Olympic Games are on a <i>biennial</i> schedule. Every two years, either the Summer or the Winter Olympics takes place.</p><p class="long">Don't mistake <i>biennial</i> for <i>biannual</i>, which means “twice a year.” Annoying? Yes, but other words containing the prefix <i>bi</i>- are even more troublesome. For example, <i>bimonthly</i> can mean either “twice a month” or “every two months.” To avoid confusion, you can use the prefix <i>semi</i>- to mean “twice during a certain time period.” So, it’s correct to say that the Olympics occurs on a biennial schedule, not on a semiannual (or biannual) one.</p></div></div>`;
