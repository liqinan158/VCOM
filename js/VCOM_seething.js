Maybe someone insulted you in front of others and you want to let it go â€” on the inside, though, you might be seething. Or during the big game, an opponent's harsh words can have you seething, but you want to stay focused on scoring points. <i>Seething</i> sometimes describes something that's boiling over, like a seething pot of soup, and this is also the root of the word.</p></div>`;
