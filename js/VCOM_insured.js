In exchange, the homeowner pays monthly (or sometimes annual) fees. If you have a life insurance policy or insurance that covers your health care, you are also insured. <i>Insured</i>, by way of the verb <i>insure</i>, comes from the original <i>ensure</i>, which has the roots <i>en-</i>, "make," and <i>sure</i>, "safe, strong, or resolute."</p></div></div>`;
