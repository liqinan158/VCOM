You might not mind telling <i>silly</i> jokes, but you don't want to be told a project you've worked hard at is <i>silly</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Silly</i> originally meant “happy,” which gives the sense of children's games or harmless jokes. Later, it came to mean “foolish”: silly ideas are looked down on because they're not very smart. <i>Silly</i> can also mean a state of foolishness brought on in a specific way. Your mother “worried herself <i>silly</i>” when you stayed out late, and promised to “slap you <i>silly</i>” when you got home.</p></div></div>`;
