When something <i>teems</i>, it swarms or overflows with a large number of things.</p><p class="long">Don't confuse <i>teem</i> with <i>team</i>. The two words may sound the same, but they have different meanings. Use the noun <i>team</i> when describing a group of people with a common goal, and turn to the verb <i>teem</i> for those times when you need to say that something is overflowing or crowded. <i>Teem</i> is almost always used with the preposition <i>with</i>, as when the busy streets teem with activity.</p></div>`;
