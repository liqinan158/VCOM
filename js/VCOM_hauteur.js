var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">hauteur</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Hauteur</i> is an obnoxious display of overbearing pride and superiority over others. Rather than showing humility and respect, a bad king might act with <i>hauteur</i> toward his subjects.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>hauteur</i> stems from the Old English word <i>haute,</i> meaning "high in one's own estimation."  Because it often develops as a result of power over others (or perceived power), it's often associated with royalty or politically powerful figures who throughout history have become vain and arrogant because of their position: A high-powered CEO might show hauteur toward the newly hired assistant; a professional athlete's hauteur may result from the media spotlight and multi-million-dollar contracts.</p></div>`;
