If you don't know why you love peanut butter and banana sandwiches so much, maybe your reasons are <i>impalpable</i>.</p><p class="long">If you’ve ever used the words “I can’t quite put my finger on it” to describe something that you have observed but can't really explain, then you already have a good idea of what <i>impalpable</i> means. <i>Impalpable</i> traces back to the Latin word <i>palpabilis</i>, meaning “that may be touched or felt.” Combine that with the prefix <i>im-</i>, and the word gets its meaning of something that can’t be perceived by normal senses.</p></div>`;
