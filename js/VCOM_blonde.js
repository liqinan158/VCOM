Marilyn Monroe had famously <i>blonde</i> hair, but only from bleaching — she was naturally a brunette.</p><p class="long">Marilyn Monroe's hair was so famous she actually starred in a movie called <i>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</i>. There the noun <i>blonde</i> is used to mean a person (a woman) with light-colored hair and skin. So you can either say, “She is <i>blonde</i>," or “She is a <i>blonde</i>,” and they mean the same thing — that she has fair hair. When describing a male's yellowish hair or light-colored stained wood, you will more often see <i>blond</i> without the silent "e" at the end. The addition of the "e" in the feminine form of <i>blonde</i> is of course a holdover from its French origin.</p></div>`;
