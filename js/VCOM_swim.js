If you live near the ocean, it's probably a good idea to learn how to <i>swim</i>.</p><p class="long">You might decide to swim across the English Channel, or, if you're a little less adventurous, just swim in your town's swimming pool. When things appear to be submerged as if underwater, they swim too: "I like it when the mashed potatoes swim in gravy." And when something appears fuzzy or whirling, it also seems to swim: "I was so tired the equations on the chalkboard began to swim." The root of <i>swim</i> means "to be in motion."</p></div></div>`;
