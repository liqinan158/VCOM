If your roommate never cleans up after herself, you might try to <i>introduce</i> some new housekeeping policies. Or, <i>introduce</i> yourself to someone who is looking for a new roommate.</p><p class="long"><i>Introduce</i> has a number of related meanings. It’s often used when bringing people together for the first time, as when a talk show host introduces a guest to the audience, or when you introduce a new girlfriend or boyfriend to your parents. <i>Introduce</i> comes from the prefix <i>intro</i>-, meaning "into," and the Latin word <i>ducere</i>, meaning "lead" — just as you may have to lead (or drag) your new sweetheart in to meet your parents.</p></div>`;
