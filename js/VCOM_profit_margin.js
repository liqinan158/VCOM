If your lemonade stand has a low <i>profit margin</i>, it's not making you rich.</p><p class="long">A business with a high profit margin takes in a lot more money than it spends. If, on the other hand, you buy five-dollar t-shirts, screen print them, and sell them for six dollars each, your profit margin is low â€” you're making a dollar per shirt, and even less if you consider the time and materials spent on screen printing. In economics, profit margin is calculated as a ratio, defined as "the percentage of the selling price that becomes profit."</p></div></div>`;
