While a linebacker on a football team is typically big and broad, a marathon runner is more likely to be <i>wiry</i>.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>wiry</i> can be used in two different ways: first, to mean "lean and strong," like a wiry seven year-old gymnast. The second meaning is "resembling wire." You could describe your thick, impossibly curly hair as <i>wiry</i>, or the crazy coat of your terrier as <i>wiry</i>. In the late 1500s the word <i>wiry</i> meant "made of wire."</p></div>`;
