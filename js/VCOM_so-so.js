If that new action movie had a few exciting scenes but an implausible plot and some uneven acting, you might say it was just <i>so-so</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>So-so</i> is perfect for describing things that fall right in between terrible and spectacular. A basketball season in which your team wins half the games and loses the other half is a so-so season. And a movie book that you didn't hate but wouldn't recommend to all of your friends is also so-so. In French you'd say "<i>Comme çi comme ça</i>," or "like this, like that," and in Swahili you might say "<i>Nusu nusu</i>," or "half and half."</p></div></div>`;
