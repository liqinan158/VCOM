Beware of <i>charlatans</i> who try to sell you access to the fountain of youth or to a Ponzi scheme disguised as an exclusive investment fund.</p><p class="long">A <i>charlatan</i> is one who pretends to possess knowledge he or she lacks. From the 16th century Italian <i>ciarlatano</i> "a quack," the usage of <i>charlatan</i> has not shifted much. Other words for <i>charlatan</i> are <i>impostor</i>, <i>cheat</i>, or <i>pretender</i>. <i>Charlatans</i> are marked by the elaborate schemes they cook up. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov said, "No psychologist should pretend to understand what he does not understand...Only fools and <i>charlatans</i> know everything and understand nothing."</p></div>`;
