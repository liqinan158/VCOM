The word "poetry" is itself a great example of a <i>dactyl</i>!</p><p class="long">When a poem is made up of three-syllable metrical feet, and the emphasis naturally lands on the first syllable of each foot, you call those units <i>dactyls</i>. The Greek root is <i>daktylos</i>, which means "unit of measure" but also "finger." The literary term came from the "finger" meaning â€” the three bones in a finger represent the three syllables in a dactyl. These lines from Alfred, Lord Tennyson's "Charge of the Light Brigade" are written in dactyls: "Flashed all their sabres bare, / Flashed as they turned in air / Sabring the gunners there."</p></div></div>`;
