You can usually tell which animal in a pasture is a <i>bull</i> by its large size and horns.</p><p class="long">A male bovine — or cow — is a bull, and so is a male whale or elephant. Fittingly, the word <i>bull</i> is sometimes also used for a particularly bulky, muscular man. Another informal and slightly obscene meaning is "ridiculous," or "not true," as when you tell a lie and your brother rudely replies, "<i>Bull</i>!" This slang meaning has its roots in the Old French <i>bole</i>, "deception or trick."</p></div></div>`;
