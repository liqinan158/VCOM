You'll find <i>engraving</i> on stationary, wedding rings, and even on tombstones.</p><p class="long">Some engraving results in an etched object, like a piece of jewelry or silverware. Other engraving is done on a metal plate, which is then used to print an illustration, design, or even paper money. You can call the design or resulting print an <i>engraving</i> as well. The word, from the verb <i>engrave</i>, combines the prefix <i>en-</i>, "in or into," and the now-obsolete <i>grave</i>, "to carve."</p></div></div>`;
