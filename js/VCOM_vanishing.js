Any time something — or someone — disappears mysteriously, it's a vanishing. The word <i>vanishing</i> is a gerund, or a noun that's made by adding <i>ing</i> to a verb, in this case <i>vanish</i>. It in turn comes from the Latin <i>evanescere</i>, "disappear," whose root word is <i>vanus</i>, or "empty."</p></div>`;
