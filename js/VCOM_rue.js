If that position at the deli ended up involving a reality TV show that made everyone famous, you may <i>rue</i> the day you turned down the job.</p><p class="long"><i>Rue</i> comes from the Old English word <i>hreowan</i>, meaning "to make sorry," and <i>rue</i> can still sum up a lot of sorrow in one small syllable. <i>Rue</i> is a modern verb that often looks back on the past. Shakespeare made famous the phrase "<i>rue</i> the day," meaning you bitterly regret a moment. For example, you might rue the day you had your first coffee if you become hopelessly addicted to it.</p></div>`;
