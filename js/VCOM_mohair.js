Sweaters and blankets made of <i>mohair</i> are extremely soft and silky (AND expensive).</p><p class="long">Mohair is known for being soft to the touch, as well as having a little bit of a shine. It's most often blended with wool to make yarn for knitting, and the result is a warm, sturdy, and glossy knit fabric. Things made from mohair tend to be more expensive than those made of ordinary wool. The word has an Arabic root, <i>mukhayyar</i>, "cloth of goat hair."</p></div>`;
