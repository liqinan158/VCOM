You can also call a <i>hassock</i> a <i>tuffet</i>, like Little Miss Muffet's tuffet in the nursery rhyme.</p><p class="long">One place you can find hassocks is in a church in which the congregation kneels during prayers. These hassocks are also known as <i>kneelers</i>. If your footrest has legs on it, it's a footstool, but if it doesn't, feel free to refer to it as a <i>hassock</i>. The oldest meaning of this word is "clump of grass." Experts guess that the "soft cushion" meaning of <i>hassock</i> came from its similarity to a soft clump of grass.</p></div></div>`;
