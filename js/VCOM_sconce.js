The hallway in your house might be lit by an electric sconce on the wall.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>sconce</i> can be used in two ways. First, a light that hangs on a wall is a sconce, whether it's an electric light in a wall bracket or a flaming torch mounted in a castle's corridor. The other kind of sconce is a castle or city fortification that's meant to protect against both enemies and bad weather. Both kinds of sconce come from the Old French <i>esconse</i>, "lantern or hiding place," with the Latin root <i>abscondere</i>, "to hide."</p></div>`;
