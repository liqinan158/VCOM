And if your mom's favorite teapot is broken after being dropped on the floor, it may be beyond repair. Other things can be metaphorically broken, like a family split by divorce, speech that's not fluent, or your heart: "It's sad that you guys split up, but you're not going to die of a broken heart."</p></div></div>`;
