var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">prance</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you <i>prance</i>, you swagger around with exaggerated, proud movements. If you've seen many rock concerts, you've seen people <i>prance</i> around onstage.</p><p class="long">When people prance, they're showing off, strutting for the benefit of their audience. Horses prance too, with a gait that's also a little artificial, using high, springy steps. You might prance a little when you run up on stage to accept an award, and a show horse might be equally inclined to prance as it moves past the judges. The horse gait definition is the original meaning of <i>prance</i>, and it probably comes from the Middle English <i>pranken</i>, "to show off."</p></div>`;
