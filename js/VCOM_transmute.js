For example, magical creatures can <i>transmute</i> into other beings. When you're fighting a wizard, don’t be surprised if he <i>transmutes</i> into a terrifying dragon.</p><p class="long">More realistically, you, too, can transmute your appearance — by dying your hair, piercing your nose, or changing your style of dress. <i>Transmute</i> often describes physical change — like when alchemists tried to transmute lead into gold — but it can also be used more figuratively to describe anything that's transformed. For example, you might transmute your sketchy memories of growing up in Boston into the Great American Novel.</p></div></div>`;
