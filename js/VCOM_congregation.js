var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">congregation</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Although the word is most usually assigned to the members of a church, any gathering might be called a <i>congregation</i>, including a gathering of animals. Come to think of it, a <i>congregation</i> of church members is often called a "flock."</p><p class="long">The Latin root of <i>congregation</i>, which is <i>greg</i>, meaning "flock," easily becomes <i>congregare</i>, meaning "to gather together," and finally <i>congregationen</i>, giving the current meaning of “a group.” The meaning took on a religious quality when 16th Century Protestants took it to refer to the church itself, then refining it to mean church members.  If you're not a churchgoer, you might still refer to your friends who show up to watch football as a congregation.</p></div>`;
