It can also mean the moment your boat touches the shore, like when your kayak makes <i>landfall</i> on a remote island.</p><p class="long">If you're traveling at sea, arriving at your destination is landfall. A child paddling a rowboat across a pond makes landfall when she reaches the far shore, and the captain of an ocean liner makes landfall at each remote stop on the route. A sailor might call out, "Landfall!" at the first sight of land on the horizon. The word <i>landfall</i> uses the sense of <i>fall</i> that means "happen."</p></div>`;
