Something that is <i>nigh</i> impossible — like knitting a sweater in one night — will be very difficult to accomplish.</p><p class="long">As an adjective, <i>nigh</i> is an older form of the word "near," both of which are rooted in the Old English word <i>neah</i>. People like to use the word <i>nigh</i> when they talk about the apocalypse: "Repent! The end is nigh." It's most common to use <i>nigh</i> today when you're trying to sound poetic or referencing the archaic or biblical uses of the word.</p></div></div>`;
