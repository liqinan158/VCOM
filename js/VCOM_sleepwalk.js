If you wake up outside in your PJ's, then, chances are, you were <i>sleepwalking</i>.</p><p class="long">A fancier word for <i>sleepwalk</i> is <i>sonamubulate</i>, and the act of sleepwalking is known as <i>sonambulism</i> by doctors who study and treat sleep disorders. It's considered a disorder to sleepwalk because normally your sleeping brain keeps you from performing actions like walking (even when you dream that you're walking). In Shakespeare's play <i>Macbeth</i>, there is a famous scene in which Lady Macbeth sleepwalks because of her guilty conscience.</p></div></div>`;
