If you draw a face on an old sock, put it on your hand, and make it act out dramatic scenes, that's <i>puppetry</i>.</p><p class="long">You may think of puppetry as kids' stuff, but people around the world consider it a valid form of theater. Puppetry has existed since at least the fifth century BCE, and it takes many forms. There's Japanese <i>bunraku</i>, in which puppeteers dressed in black maneuver wooden puppets against a black background. Italy is famous for inventing marionettes, highly complex puppets on strings. "The Muppet Show" and "Sesame Street" are also perfect examples of great puppetry in action.</p></div></div>`;
