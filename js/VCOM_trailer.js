Some bike-riding parents tow their small children behind them in bicycle <i>trailers</i>.</p><p class="long">The trailer you might put a boat on, hitching it to your truck, <i>trails</i> behind the vehicle that's pulling it. Another meaning of <i>trailer</i> is a film preview or advertisement that theaters show before a movie. It might seem strange to call it a <i>trailer</i> when it comes first, but the earliest trailers, at the start of the 20th century, came after the movie, <i>trailing</i> it.</p></div>`;
