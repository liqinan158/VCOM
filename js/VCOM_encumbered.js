It's tricky to take photographs outside in the winter when you're <i>encumbered</i> with thick gloves and layers of coats and sweaters.</p><p class="long">When your movements are restricted, you're encumbered. You might be physically encumbered by having too many things to carry, or your ability to speak freely can be encumbered by the people at the next table who are clearly listening in on your conversation â€” and laughing at you. <i>Encumbered</i> is used often to talk about debt; you might be encumbered by a high monthly car payment that prevents you from buying concert tickets.</p></div>`;
