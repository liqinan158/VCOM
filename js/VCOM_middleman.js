For example, if you are selling your house, your real estate agent acts as the <i>middleman</i> between you and the buyer.</p><p class="long">Anyone whose job involves buying and re-selling can be called a <i>middleman</i>, although sometimes the thing being sold is some kind of service rather than physical goods. One example of a middleman is a wholesaler who buys fruit and vegetables from farmers and then distributes them to large supermarkets. While sometimes it makes more sense for farmers to sell directly to stores, a middleman can simplify the process.</p></div></div>`;
