Applause after a performance, shouting "Way to go!" or sending a nice card — all express <i>congratulations</i>.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>congratulation</i> comes from the Latin word  <i>congratulari</i>, which means “with joy.” The word is usually used in the plural form: congratulations. Any achievement can bring you others' congratulations, from big things like receiving an award or graduating, to more everyday things like making the swim team or getting a good grade on a test. If someone is proud of you and happy for what you've done, congratulations are in order.</p></div></div>`;
