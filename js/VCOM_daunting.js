If you have a lot of studying to do, it may seem like a <i>daunting</i> task. Good news is you can get through it by working hard. Or weasel out of it by playing sick.</p><p class="long">Often used in the phrases “daunting prospect” and “daunting task,” <i>daunting</i> describes something that you are not looking forward to doing. Having to fill out complicated tax forms every year is a daunting task for many people. Once a daunting task is complete, you no longer describe it as <i>daunting</i>, but instead can call it a job well done, or at least another life experience survived.</p></div></div>`;
