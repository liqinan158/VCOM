In 1912, the German scientist Alfred Wegener came up with the theory of continental drift, which is what it sounds like — the theory that over time, the continents drifted into the positions they’re in now. The continental drift theory is now a part of plate tectonics — the idea that there was once a giant continent that broke up into the ones we know today.</p></div></div>`;
