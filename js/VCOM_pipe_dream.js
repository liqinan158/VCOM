Imagining that life will be like a Disney movie is one kind of pipe dream, and fantasizing about becoming a famous rock star is another kind of pipe dream. Some pipe dreams do come true, but most of them won't ever be more than a crazy idea. This term dates from the 1870s, and it originally referred to the strange, hallucinatory dreams that opium smokers had.</p></div></div>`;
