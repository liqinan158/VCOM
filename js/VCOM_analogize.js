You make an analogy. If you say that DNA is like a twisted ladder, you <i>analogize</i> to make it easier for someone to imagine.</p><p class="long">The word <i>analogize</i> comes from the Greek <i>analogizesthai</i> which basically means "to sum up." When you analogize something, you sum it up by making a comparison. In literature, similes and metaphors are used to analogize. The poet Robert Burns analogizes when he writes, "My love is like a red, red rose." If a babysitter complains, "These kids are like a pack of wild dogs," he analogizes the kids and dogs. And he probably wonâ€™t be back.</p></div>`;
