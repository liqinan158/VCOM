You might <i>involuntarily</i> start to giggle during your cousin's Star Wars-themed wedding ceremony.</p><p class="long">Use the adverb <i>involuntarily</i> to describe things that are done against your will or without your control. You'll involuntarily take a swim if your brother pushes you in the deep end of a pool; when you have a twitch in your eye, you blink involuntarily. In either case, the word <i>involuntarily</i> combines the Latin prefix <i>in</i>, "not or opposite of" with <i>voluntarius</i>, "of one's free will."</p></div></div>`;
