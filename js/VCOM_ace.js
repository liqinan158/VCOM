There are four <i>aces</i> in a full deck of cards, each with a single heart, spade, diamond, or club pictured on it.</p><p class="long"><i>Ace</i> can also describe someone who's excellent at a particular skill: "He's an <i>ace</i> at making homemade jam!" In tennis, an <i>ace</i> is a point scored on a missed serve, and in golf it's a hole in one. When you <i>ace</i> something, you do a great job: "Just get in there and <i>ace</i> that math test today!" The earliest meaning was "one at dice," from the Latin <i>as</i>, "a unit, one, or a whole."</p></div></div>`;
