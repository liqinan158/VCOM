Your favorite <i>indie</i> group probably makes most of its money from touring, rather than by selling its music online.</p><p class="long">Pop musicians who record songs independently of major labels are indie, and indie filmmakers work with small budgets and unknown actors, rather than large, well-funded film companies. The adjective is also sometimes used simply to mean "simple," "not commercial," or "outside of the mainstream." <i>Indie</i>, a shortened form of <i>independent</i>, has been around since about 1920, originally referring to movies, and by 1945 it was also used for music labels.</p></div>`;
