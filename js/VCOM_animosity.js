If your (supposed) best buddy embarrasses you in front of a big crowd, your friendship could turn into <i>animosity</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Animosity</i> comes from the Latin word <i>animus</i>, meaning "spirit" or "mind." That's also the root of the word <i>animated</i> â€” literally, "full of spirit." So how did <i>animosity</i> get so negative? Over the centuries, the original meaning of "high spirits" soured into "hatred." Today we most often speak of animosity <i>toward, between, among,</i> or <i>against</i> people. Keeping your animosity in check might make steam come out your ears.</p></div>`;
