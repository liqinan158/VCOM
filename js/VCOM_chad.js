Some voting machines work by punching holes in ballots, leaving a <i>chad</i> hanging from the back.</p><p class="long">The chad that falls off a card or piece of paper is a waste product of hole punching, often in the process of voting or punching a time card. The word <i>chad</i> was first used in the 1930s, but most Americans never heard it until the 2000 presidential election, when some votes in Florida were contested because of partially-punched ballots with chads still attached.</p></div>`;
