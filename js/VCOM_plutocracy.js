A <i>plutocracy</i> is very different from a democracy, in which in person's vote counts equally.</p><p class="long">Whenever you see the suffix <i>-cracy</i>, you know you're dealing with a form of rulership or government. The first part of the word comes from the Greek <i>ploutos</i>, meaning wealth. Put them together, and you get <i>plutocracy</i>, a government ruled by the rich. How does this differ from, say, an aristocracy? Well, the truth is that it isn't very different. Members of the aristocracy tend to be rich, but their money tends to be "old money." In a pure <i>plutocracy</i>, even the overnight billionaire can be a ruler.</p></div></div>`;
