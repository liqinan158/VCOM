It can also affect neighborhoods. Urban <i>blight</i> refers to a part of the city where things are falling apart.</p><p class="long"><i>Blight</i> rhymes with bright, but it’s the opposite of sunshine; instead of making plants grow, it cripples them. The Irish Potato Famine was an example of a <i>blight</i>. In 1845, more than a third of the potato crops were ruined. The plants turned black and their leaves dried up and people who relied on potatoes for most of their meals also withered and experienced extreme hardship and hunger. You might want to think of it this way: a <i>blight</i> makes people — or plants — fight for their lives.</p></div>`;
