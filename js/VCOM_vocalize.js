A tiny baby can only <i>vocalize</i> gurgles and coos, but by the time she's three or four, she'll <i>vocalize</i> all kinds of opinions.</p><p class="long"><i>Vocalize</i> literally means to make a noise using your voice â€” in fact, <i>vocalize</i> is rooted in the Latin root word for "voice," <i> vox</i>. It's nearly a synonym for <i>verbalize</i>, "put into words," except that when you vocalize you may speak using words or you may merely make noises. So while your dog is smart enough to vocalize a response when you say, "Speak," he's still not smart enough to verbalize.</p></div>`;
