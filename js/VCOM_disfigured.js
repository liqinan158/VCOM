A <i>disfigured</i> landscape might be one that's had all its trees cut down to make way for a new development.</p><p class="long">You might describe the town where you grew up as disfigured if dozens of tall buildings had been constructed since the last time you visited. People can also be described this way, especially when an accident leaves scars or otherwise damages the way they look. <i>Disfigured</i> comes from the prefix <i>dis-</i>, which means "not, un-, or away," and <i>figured</i>, from the Latin <i>figura</i>, "shape, form, or figure."</p></div></div>`;
