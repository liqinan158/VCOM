Calling something <i>phallic</i> means it's penis-like in some way. In some cases, that means it has creative power, like how a penis, through sex, creates new life. In other cases, people just mean it looks like the shape of a penis. Many people have looked at phallic shapes in the world — such as missiles and many sculptures — and wondered what exactly the creators were thinking about.</p></div>`;
