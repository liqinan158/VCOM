Maybe it's points in a game. Maybe it's the love of your life. Sorry about that.</p><p class="long">You can physically lose something by misplacing it, or you can lose your pride in a competition. You can lose a game, you can lose your library book, you can lose money, you can lose your business, you can lose sight of your child, you can even lose your mind â€” basically, you can lose just about anything. Losing something is usually not a good thing, unless it's that annoying boyfriend or weight.</p></div>`;
