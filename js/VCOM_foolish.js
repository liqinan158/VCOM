Sitting on the hood of a car while your friend is driving is a <i>foolish</i> thing to do.</p><p class="long">Things that show a lack of judgment are foolish, like cheating on a test or running into the street after a basketball. Foolish decisions at work can cost you your job, and foolish comments can hurt people's feelings. <i>Foolish</i> is a 14th century word that comes from <i>fool</i>, a person who's unwise. The Latin root, <i>follis</i>, means "bellows" or "leather bag." The "silly person" meaning comes from the figurative idea of a "windbag."</p></div></div>`;
