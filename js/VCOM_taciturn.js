The word itself refers to the trait of reticence, of seeming aloof and uncommunicative. A <i>taciturn</i> person might be snobby, naturally quiet, or just shy.</p><p class="long">Having its origin in the Latin <i>tacitus</i>, "silent," <i>taciturn</i> came to be used in mid-18th-century English in the sense "habitually silent." Taciturnity is often considered a negative trait, as it suggests someone uncommunicative and too quiet. Jane Austen wrote, "We are each of an unsocial, <i>taciturn</i> disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the Ã©clat of a proverb."</p></div>`;
