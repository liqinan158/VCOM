One type of ejaculation is the male orgasm, when semen is propelled from the penis. The other type of ejaculation is verbal. "Stop!" and "Wow!" are examples of ejaculations. People make ejaculations when they're excited or have something important to say. Ejaculations are also called interjections. They often interrupt, and they're usually full of emotion. <i>Duh, yikes, holy cow,</i> and <i>d'oh</i> (as in Homer Simpson's <i>D'OH!</i>) are all ejaculations.</p></div>`;
