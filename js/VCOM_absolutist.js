North Korea is an example of a country that's been run by an <i>absolutist</i> leader for many years.</p><p class="long">In politics, the word <i>absolutist</i> is very closely related to the terms <i>totalitarian</i> and <i>autocratic</i>. In all of these types of governments, with a bit of variation, there is one all-powerful ruler who is in charge. Citizens of a country with an absolutist leadership don't have a say in any decisions the government makes â€” there is no democratic process, and no checks on the ruler's power. As a political term, <i>absolutist</i> has been around since the 1830's, from the noun <i>absolutism</i>.</p></div>`;
