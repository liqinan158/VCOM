It is often figuratively used to describe solemn or dismal things as well as something that is related to a burial ceremony.  Funereal music is gloomy and often played at a slow pace. If you don't want to seem overly serious, you might want to wear a navy blue suit to your job interview rather than funereal black.</p></div></div>`;
