If you grew up speaking English, no one had to tell you that "Throw the ball to me," is a sentence in English, but "Ball the me to throw" is not. You may, though, need coaching to avoid common errors — “bad <i>grammar</i>" — like “Throw the ball to he and I,” where you should say “Throw the ball to him and me.”</p></div>`;
