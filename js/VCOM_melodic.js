If your French teacher has a friendly smile and a <i>melodic</i> voice, you could probably sit and listen to her talk for hours.</p><p class="long">Anything sweet sounding — a bird's trill, a poet's voice, or the tune you sing in the shower — is melodic. A more technical meaning of the word is "containing melody," the definition a professional musician might use.  Melody is a quality of music defined as "tunefulness" or "a satisfying series of notes." Music teachers play melodic patterns for their students to duplicate, and composers sometimes combine melodic phrases to form a symphony. The Greek root of <i>melodic</i> is <i>melos</i>, or "song."</p></div>`;
