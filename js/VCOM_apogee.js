Early satellites had low <i>apogees</i>, so it wasn’t long before they burnt up in the atmosphere.</p><p class="long"><i>Apogee</i> comes from two Greek words meaning “away” and “earth,” so it’s specific to things orbiting the earth. If you’re talking about something orbiting the sun, the equivalent word is <i>aphelion</i>, “away” + “sun." Because <i>apogee</i> denotes the highest point something reaches in an orbit before falling back, it can also figuratively refer to other highs. For example, "Child stars sometimes reach their apogee by 20, and there's nowhere to go but down from there."</p></div></div>`;
