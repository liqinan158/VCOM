One well-known master of <i>pointillism</i> was Georges Seurat.</p><p class="long">This school of painters seems to have gotten a head start on the pixel by 100 years! Their technique of painting consists of tiny dots of pure color that, when viewed from a distance, coalesce to give an impression not too far off what actually hits the eye in nature. In French, the diminutive plural of <i>point</i> is <i>pointilles</i>, or tiny dots, and the verb <i>pointiller</i> means "to cover with small dots."</p></div></div>`;
