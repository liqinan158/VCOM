You can solve other, non-mathematical problems too â€” like the question of what to wear when you've run out of clean clothes (your sibling's clothes!). The word <i>solve</i> originally came from the Latin <i>solvere</i>, which meant "to loosen or untie." If you think of any kind of complex problem as a knot, then the original definition of <i>solve</i> still makes sense!</p></div>`;
