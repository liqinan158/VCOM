var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">ponder</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I <i>pondered</i>, weak and weary" is the first line of Edgar Allan Poe's poem <i>The Raven</i>. Many a deep thinker has repeated it while musing. But if you've given up deep thinking, you may say instead, "Nevermore."</p><p class="long">Think of <i>ponder</i> as reflecting on weighty thoughts. It will help you remember the definition if you can remember the word's Latin roots. It comes from <i>ponderare</i>, which literally meant to weigh, and <i>pondus</i>, which means weight. People sometimes use the word ironically, for example, when someone asks you to do something you really don't want to do. You may tap your chin for a second and say, "Let me <i>ponder</i> that." Pause. "Um, no!"</p></div>`;
