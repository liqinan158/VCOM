When people are called <i>saturnine</i>, it means they are like the planet — gloomy, mean, scowling. Not exactly the life of the party.</p><p class="long"><i>Saturnine</i> is a word you don't hear often nowadays, though you probably know people with saturnine dispositions. The ultimate saturnine character in literature is Heathcliff — and for clarification's sake, that would be the brooding, bitter, brooding, obsessive hero of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, not the lovably pudgy cat of comic-strip fame.</p></div></div>`;
