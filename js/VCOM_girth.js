If you get pregnant with twins, your <i>girth</i> will probably block your view of your toes.</p><p class="long">One can measure the girth — diameter of the mid-section — of an airplane, tree trunk, or anything cylindrical, but it most often describes a large human waist. A rail-thin person doesn’t have a “minuscule <i>girth</i>,” but when Aunt Velma has her seventh helping of lasagna and has to unbuckle her belt, her girth has outsized her attire. <i>Girth</i> can also mean a strap that encircles the belly of a horse, mule, or other animal to secure a load.</p></div>`;
