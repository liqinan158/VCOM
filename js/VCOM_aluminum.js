Most soda cans are made out of <i>aluminum</i>.</p><p class="long">There is more aluminum in the earth's crust than any other kind of metal, and because it is so sturdy, pliable, and light, it's used to make all kinds of things. Airplane parts, aluminum foil, metal baseball bats, bicycles, and some power lines are just a few of the everyday objects that are made at least in part from aluminum. The name is based on <i>alumina</i>, or aluminum oxide, with a Latin root of <i>alumen</i>, "bitter salt."</p></div></div>`;
