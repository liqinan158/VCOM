When you're visiting New Orleans, you should definitely try some <i>gumbo</i>.</p><p class="long">One of gumbo's traditional thickeners is the vegetable called okra, which is sometimes also called <i>gumbo</i>, from the Angolan word <i>kingombo</i>. The ingredients of an authentic gumbo can vary a lot, though it almost always starts with celery, onions, and peppers and flavorful stock. From there, it needs a thickener (either a roux or cooked okra), spices, and meat or shellfish. Gumbo is the official food of the state of Louisiana.</p></div>`;
