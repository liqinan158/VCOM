If you're trying to pick a fancy restaurant to go to for your birthday, you'll probably <i>reject</i> the diner you went to just yesterday.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>reject</i> has several shades of meaning. <i>Reject</i> can mean to refuse to accept or agree with something. If you don't believe space aliens are living on earth, you reject the idea — you just don't believe it. <i>Reject</i> can also mean to treat someone with contempt: "My former best friend rejected me to hang out with a different crowd — but I found new friends with whom I had more in common."</p></div>`;
