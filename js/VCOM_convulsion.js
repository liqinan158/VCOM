A <i>convulsion</i> is a jerking, uncontrolled movement.</p><p class="long">When a person has a convulsion, it appears as a sudden, violent movement of the body. Convulsions most often happen as a result of a medical condition or illness like epilepsy, but you can also describe a jerky, irregular movement as a <i>convulsion</i>, even if it's caused by hiccups or laughter. A political upheaval or social turmoil can also be called a <i>convulsion</i>, if it's abrupt and violent. The Latin root word is <i>convulsionem</i>, which means "to tear loose."</p></div></div>`;
