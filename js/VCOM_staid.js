Something that is staid is sedate, slightly dull, and tends to stay the same. Whether it’s a middle-class lifestyle, a conservative law firm, your unadventurous aunt, or an old navy plaid sofa, the word <i>staid</i> can be used to describe anything that maintains a respectable self-restraint and takes no chances.</p></div>`;
