Some are followed by a period (.) to show that the word has been shortened. Acronyms, like DNA, SAT, or NATO, which are abbreviations that are formed from the first letters of a series of words, are written in all capitals. And don’t get confused: if your friend asks to give you an abbreviation of his speech, he’s not going to shorten each word; he’s just going to leave the details out.</p></div></div>`;
