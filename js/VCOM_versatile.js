White's classic children's book <i>Charlotte's Web</i>, Charlotte the spider tells Wilbur the pig that she is versatile. "What does 'versatile' mean â€” full of eggs?" Wilbur asks. "Certainly not," Charlotte replies. "'Versatile' means I can turn with ease from one thing to another." Charlotte knew her etymology, because the word reflects its Latin root, <i>versatilis</i>, "turning around; revolving." It eventually came to describe someone who is multi-talented: a singer-songwriter-actress-model would be a versatile figure in the entertainment world.</p></div></div>`;
