A bored high school student might <i>traipse</i> through a museum on a class trip, for example.</p><p class="long">When you traipse, you trudge in an exhausted or reluctant way. Picture several kids dutifully following their dad along a hiking path or walking a mile to school, and you'll have a good idea of what <i>traipse</i> means. We've used the word since the 16th century, but its origin isn't certain. Some scholars think <i>traipse</i> comes from the French <i>trepasser</i>, "to pass over," while others believe it started as an example of onomatopoeia, a word that sounds like what it means.</p></div></div>`;
