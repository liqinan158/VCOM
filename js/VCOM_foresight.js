When it starts raining hard during your long walk to school, you'll wish you had the <i>foresight</i> to bring an umbrella.</p><p class="long">The word <i>foresight</i> is made of two parts: <i>fore</i>, which means "before," and <i>sight</i>, which means "to perceive." People often perceive things with their eyes: this is vision, or sight. But vision can also describe what someone thinks will happen in the future â€” and foresight is planning for things before they happen.</p></div></div>`;
