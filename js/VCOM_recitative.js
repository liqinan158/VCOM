You'll usually hear <i>recitative</i> in opera.</p><p class="long">Most classical operas are a mix of arias (melodic, expressive songs) and recitatives, which are meant to move the plot along or fill in information in the story. While the arias are the most beautiful parts of an opera, recitatives are much less memorable. The word comes from the Italian <i>recitativo</i>, and goes back to the Latin <i>recitare</i>,  "read aloud."</p></div>`;
