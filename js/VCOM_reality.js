Many TV shows claim to be <i>reality</i>, but they are really just pretend. The only actual <i>reality</i> is the life that happens every day.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>reality</i> harkens back to the late Latin <i>realis</i>, and later to the mid-16th Century Medieval Latin <i>reālitās</i>, referring to legal property matters, with the current meaning of "true existence" not coming about until 1647. Philosophers and scientists often debate about the true nature of reality, and a common philosophy is that a person’s reality is whatever he or she thinks it is. Or, as film director Tim Burton once said, "One person's craziness is another person's reality."</p></div>`;
