Your favorite movies might be quiet, slow-paced, and <i>meditative</i>.</p><p class="long">When you reflect on your life or an important decision, you are meditative, and anything that involves this state of mind can be described the same way. A yoga studio often has a meditative feeling about it, and good, thoughtful advice is usually offered in a meditative way. The root of <i>meditative</i> is the Latin word <i>meditat</i>, or "contemplated," which in turn comes from a Proto-Indo-European root that means "to measure, consider, or advise."</p></div>`;
