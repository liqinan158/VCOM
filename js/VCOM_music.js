If  you sing, whistle, or play an instrument, you are making <i>music</i>. You can also write <i>music</i> using the specific language of notes.</p><p class="long">In Greek mythology, the goddesses who inspired creativity were called the Muses, from the words <i>mousikḕ téchnē</i> ("the art of the muses”). This led to the Latin <i>mūsica</i>.  The word is also used in various idioms, such as "face the <i>music</i>," which means to accept consequences, and "making beautiful <i>music</i> together," which suggests making love.  If something is "like <i>music</i> to your ears," you are happy to hear it.</p></div>`;
