You can also call a <i>hand truck</i> a "dolly" or a "two-wheeler."</p><p class="long">With a hand truck, it's easier to move things that might be too heavy for you to pick up and carry. It's not too difficult to transport even a stack of boxes from one area to another using a hand truck, which is designed for just such a task. Most hand trucks are L-shaped, with a flat ledge to slide underneath an object and large wheels to make it easy to balance the cargo.</p></div>`;
