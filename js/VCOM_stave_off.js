When you <i>stave off</i> a cold, you work to avoid getting one, maybe by drinking plenty of tea and eating oranges.</p><p class="long">You might help stave off the closing of a library by donating money and writing letters to the city council, or stave off the winter blues by traveling to a Caribbean island for a week. The phrase to <i>stave off</i> has a long history, dating from 1620 when it was used to mean "fend off with a staff," the way you might stave off a pack of growling dogs.</p></div></div>`;
