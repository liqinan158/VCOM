A building might be situated on the top of a hill — that's its position or <i>situation</i>.</p><p class="long">You've probably heard the term "sitcom," but may not realize it is short for "<i>situation</i> comedy," or a comedy where the humor is based on a set of quirky circumstances the characters find themselves placed in. A <i>situation</i> can also mean a set of circumstances that you find yourself placed in: holding both halves of a crazy aunt's broken vase could be a sticky situation — perfect for a situation comedy.</p></div></div>`;
