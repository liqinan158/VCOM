It can also mean to position or prepare something for action, or, simply, to <i>lay</i> eggs.</p><p class="long">The word <i>lay</i> can mean a lot of different things, but one of its most common uses is as the adjective component of <i>layperson,</i> which refers to someone who's not a member of the clergy, or who's not a member of a particular profession and so cannot always understand that profession's technical jargon. This is why we sometimes request things to be communicated in "lay language," meaning simple, everyday terms that a layperson can understand.</p></div></div>`;
