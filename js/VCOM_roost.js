Backyard chickens need a comfortable, secure <i>roost</i> to stay warm and rested.</p><p class="long">You can use <i>roost</i> to mean the perch that birds stand on while resting, the structure that contains the perch, or even a random tree branch, in the case of a wild bird. As a verb, it means to sit or to rest: "The chickens began to <i>roost</i> for the evening." When someone says, "Chickens come home to <i>roost</i>," they mean that bad actions eventually have bad consequences. And if you "rule the <i>roost</i>," you're in charge.</p></div></div>`;
