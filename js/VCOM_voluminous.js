Suddenly, it seems to be part of a much bigger thing. And what if it were only Volume I, with 23 more volumes to go? Even bigger, right? In fact, it's more than big; itâ€™s <i>voluminous</i>. <i>Voluminous</i> describes very large things. The flouncy skirt of a wedding dress? <i>Voluminous</i>. Media coverage of some movie star's divorce? Also <i>voluminous</i>. The word <i>voluminous</i> describes something ample, extensive, and just plain huge.</p></div></div>`;
