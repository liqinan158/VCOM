If you write <i>reams</i> of love letters to your beloved, I hope she appreciates them.  Or at least recycles.</p><p class="long">The word <i>ream</i> has two distinct meanings, depending on whether you use it as a noun or a verb. As a noun, it refers to an amount of paper, its origin from the Arabic <i>rizmah</i>, or "bundle." As a verb, <i>ream</i> is a rough word that can mean "to make a hole in" or "to squeeze."  When you "ream someone out" you give them a scolding.</p></div>`;
