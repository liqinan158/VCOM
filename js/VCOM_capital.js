A bank's <i>capital</i> might be in the billions, while your <i>capital</i> barely makes it into the hundreds.</p><p class="long"><i>Capital</i> comes from the Latin <i>capitalis</i>, or "head," which some would argue is the command center of your body. Because your head is so important, <i>capital</i>, as a noun and as an adjective, has come to refer to the primary or chief example of something â€” whether it's money, a letter, a crime, or the national or state seat of a government. It can be easily confused with the American word <i>capitol</i>, which refers to the buildings where government activities take place.</p></div>`;
