When an event causes great suffering, we call it a <i>cataclysm</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Cataclysm</i> comes from the Greek word <i>kataklysmos</i>, which means "a deluge or flood." So saying something was “a disaster of cataclysmic proportions” is particularly apt when you're talking about a tsunami. Still, people use the word <i>cataclysmic</i> to describe non-watery disasters, too, like stock market crashes, painful breakups, and failed grammar tests.</p></div></div>`;
