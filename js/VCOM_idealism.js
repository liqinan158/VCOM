Sometimes, though, <i>idealism</i> is a sort of incurable optimism.</p><p class="long">It's one thing if you always pursue high-minded goals and right conduct — one definition of <i>idealism</i>. Just be careful to not get so caught up that you fail to see things as they really are — you don't want to go through life "wearing rose-colored glasses" — yet another definition of <i>idealism</i>. In philosophy, <i>idealism</i> is the theory that ideas are the only reality.</p></div></div>`;
