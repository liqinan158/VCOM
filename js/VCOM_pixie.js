If you spy some adorable little sprites in green pointed hats sneaking around the woods, you can bet that they're <i>pixies</i>.</p><p class="long">Pixies appear in folk and fairy tales from the southwest part of England, making minor mischief and dancing in groups. Today a pixie is more or less the same as a fairy or sprite, but older folktales describe conflicts (and even wars) between these groups. The root of the word <i>pixie</i> is a mystery â€” it may be related to the Swedish dialect <i>pyske</i>, "small fairy," but it's probably rooted in an unknown Celtic word.</p></div>`;
