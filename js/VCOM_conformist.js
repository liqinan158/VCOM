If you're a <i>conformist</i>, it's unlikely you'll join a revolution to overthrow your government; instead you'll argue that it's best to keep things the way they are.</p><p class="long">Conformist comes from the Old French word <i>conformer</i>, which means "to agree to, make or be similar, be agreeable." People sometimes use the term <i>conformist</i> in a negative way, as an insult implying that someone doesn't have the brains or the guts to question the status quo. <i>Conformist</i> can also be used as an adjective to describe something that follows convention and established customs. A conformist school board, for example, would follow the usual time-tested curriculum.</p></div>`;
