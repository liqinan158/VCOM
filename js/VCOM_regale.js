So, if you need to please or impress someone, <i>regale</i> them — that is, treat them to lavish food and drink.</p><p class="long">While food is reliable way to regale someone, <i>regale</i> can also involve providing forms of entertainment such as music or storytelling. <i>Regale</i> is akin to the word <i>gala</i>, meaning “a festive party,” and <i>gallant</i>, which can mean “spirited and adventurous” (though <i>gallant</i> can also mean “noble and brave”). If you regale someone with a gala attended by partygoers who are gallant, in either sense of the word, everyone should have a pretty good time.</p></div></div>`;
