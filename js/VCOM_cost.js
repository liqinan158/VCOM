The high <i>cost</i> of a fancy coffee drink might surprise you.</p><p class="long">A new car costs thousands of dollars, while in some places penny candy still only costs a penny per piece. <i>Cost</i> also means "cause a loss," as when a bad fumble costs your favorite football team the game, or your brother's cheating on a test costs him the respect of his favorite teacher. The Old French <i>cost</i> meant "outlay, expenditure, hardship, or trouble," from the Latin root <i>constare</i>, "to stand at or to cost."</p></div></div>`;
