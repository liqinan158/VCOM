var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">fatuous</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Fatuous</i> means lacking intelligence. When your mother outlaws calling your brother stupid, use <i>fatuous</i> instead.</p><p class="long"><i>Fatuous</i> derives from the Latin <i>fatuus</i> meaning "foolish." It sounds like it should have something to do with being fat, but it actually has no relation to size. <i>Fatuus</i> itself comes from a root that also gave us "debate" and this might be a good way to remember it. You want to debate someone who's fatuous, because they are unintelligent, silly and even a bit conceited, so they probably won't be very persuasive debaters. Just don't call them fatuous to their face. Even if they don't know what it means, it's just not nice!</p></div>`;
