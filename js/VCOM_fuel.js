You both run on <i>fuel</i>. Whether its gasoline or nutritious food, <i>fuel</i> produces energy to get up and go.</p><p class="long"><i>Fuel</i> can also act as a verb that has several different meanings, all related to stimulating something or providing energy. Your brother might fuel up on whole-wheat bread with peanut butter a few hours before a big game. A teacher assigns readings to fuel meaningful class discussion. Memories of your mom's delicious dinners might fuel your desire to learn to cook.</p></div></div>`;
