People usually use this word when they're being humorous or informal. A CEO would be unlikely to say <i>zilch</i> when speaking to shareholders. A friend who beats another friend 3-0 in air hockey is likely to say "I win, three to <i>zilch</i>!" Zilch can also be called <i>aught, a goose egg, nada, naught, nil, nix, null, zip,<i> or <i>zippo</i>.</i></i></p></div></div>`;
