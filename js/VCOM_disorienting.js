It's <i>disorienting</i> each time you step out of a subway station in a big city — it takes a minute to get your bearings and figure out which direction to walk.</p><p class="long">Waking up from the anesthetic after having your wisdom teeth removed is very disorienting, and a disorienting first day at a new school shouldn't be surprising. The adjective <i>disorienting</i> comes from <i>disorient</i>, or "make someone lose their sense of direction," which has a French source, <i>désorienter</i>, "to cause to lose one's bearings," or literally, "to turn from the east."</p></div></div>`;
