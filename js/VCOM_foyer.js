Sometimes a <i>foyer</i> is also called a "lobby."</p><p class="long"><i>Foyer</i> originally was a term in French that referred to the room where actors waited when they were not on stage. Today, a foyer is a large entrance to a building or home. The bigger and fancier a mansion, office or apartment building is, the bigger and more ornate the foyer will likely be. After all, the foyer will be the first room that visitors see when entering.</p></div>`;
