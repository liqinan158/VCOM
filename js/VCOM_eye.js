Your eyes are sense organs, and unless you're visually impaired, they enable you to see the world around you. The tiny hole in a needle is also an <i>eye</i>, and when you look at someone, you eye them. To lay eyes on something is to see it for the first time, and when you keep an eye on someone, you observe them carefully.</p></div></div>`;
