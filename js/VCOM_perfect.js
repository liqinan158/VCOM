(Note, though, the pronunciation difference: PER-fect as a noun; per-FECT as a verb.) It originally comes from the Latin word <i>perficere,</i> which breaks down into <i>per-</i> ("completely") and <i>facere</i> ("do"). As a noun <i>perfect</i> is a grammatical term referring to a tense of verbs describing an action that has been completed.</p></div></div>`;
