Your father's <i>leniency</i>, for example, resulted in you not having to paint the entire house like your mother wanted. Instead you just had to paint the garage.</p><p class="long"><i>Leniency</i> also refers to a person's sense of mercy or tolerance. A governor's leniency could be demonstrated when he pardons the prisoners on death row. <i>Leniency</i> comes from the adjective <i>lenient</i>, which describes someone who is tolerant or permissive. There are times when too much leniency can backfire, however. If your teacher shows leniency to the loud students who won't sit still and refuses to punish them, the rest of your class won't learn much.</p></div></div>`;
