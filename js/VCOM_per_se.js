It is not this Latin phrase, <i>per se</i>, that is important, but rather the concept it represents.</p><p class="long"><i>Per se</i> is handy when you need to single out a particular element of a bigger thing. So you might say, "The song, <i>per se</i>, wasn't a bad choice; it was your singing voice that was atrocious." In Latin it means "by itself." When you want to sound a little smart, inject a <i>per se</i> into what you're saying. It's one of those phrases, like "insomuch" or "as it were," that helps win arguments.</p></div></div>`;
