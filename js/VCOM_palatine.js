Through the 17th century, European <i>palatines</i> were nobles who inherited land and ruled over it separately from the greater kingdom.</p><p class="long">This word stems from the Medieval Latin <i>palatinus</i>, "of the palace," and in the ancient Roman world, someone working in a prince's palace was described as <i>comes palatinus</i>, or "possessing royal privileges." Through history, being a palatine meant having an enormous amount of power over a specific territory. Today the word is also used as an adjective meaning "connected to the palate of the mouth."</p></div>`;
