You could mull over what aid organization to donate money to following a natural disaster, or mull over what to study in college. People are most likely to mull over important decisions, but you can use the word <i>mull</i>, almost always with <i>over</i>, any time you're giving serious consideration to something. A completely different meaning of <i>mull</i> is "to heat, sweeten, and spice," as when you make mulled cider.</p></div></div>`;
