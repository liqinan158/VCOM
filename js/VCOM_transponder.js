With a special <i>transponder</i> in your car, you can drive slowly through a tollbooth as your toll is collected electronically.</p><p class="long">The word <i>transponder</i> is what's known as a <i>portmanteau</i>, or a combination of two words into one â€” in this case, it comes from <i>transmit</i> and <i>respond</i>. Airplanes carry transponders that can communicate with the radar used by air traffic controllers on the ground, and race cars contain transponders that help time their laps accurately.</p></div></div>`;
