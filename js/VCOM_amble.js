Care to <i>amble</i> down a pleasant country road instead of reading the rest of this word description? That would certainly be understandable.</p><p class="long"><i>Amble</i> is both a noun meaning "a stroll" and a verb meaning "to walk in a slow, leisurely way." You might amble (or take an amble) over to the snack table and grab a brownie. <i>Amble</i> comes from the Latin <i>ambulare</i>, which means "to walk about," as in <i>ambulatory.</i> Weirdly enough, it was once only used for horses or those on horseback. We use it for people now, but it still retains some of its horse-like, country feel.</p></div></div>`;
