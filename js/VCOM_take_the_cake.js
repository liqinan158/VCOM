For example, you might say, "Stealing your own child's Halloween candy really <i>takes the cake</i>!"</p><p class="long">Originally, to <i>take the cake</i> meant to win a prize or a competition â€” people as far back as the ancient Greeks used the word <i>cake</i> to mean "a symbolic prize." Over time, it grew to have a more negative, sarcastic meaning in English: "I can't believe this mess. It just <i>takes the cake</i>." A common variation is to <i>take the biscuit</i>.</p></div></div>`;
