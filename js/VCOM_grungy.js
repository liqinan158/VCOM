Then they're grungy, so ingrained with dirt and oil that you'll have to scrub to get them clean. Dirty and sloppy things are grungy too, like the grungy outfit you wear when you spend the day taking care of your uncle's pet pigs. This informal American slang word is probably influenced by both <i>dingy</i> and <i>grubby</i>.</p></div>`;
