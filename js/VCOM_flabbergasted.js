You are really, really shocked — pretty much speechless.</p><p class="long">Use the adjective <i>flabbergasted</i> to describe someone who's astounded or surprised for any reason, good or bad. You could be flabbergasted at how astonishingly expensive a parking ticket is, or at how incredibly delicious pineapple pizza is. <i>Flabbergasted</i> has been used since the late 18th century, but no one knows for sure where it originated. The word sounds like what it means: when you say it out loud — "flabbergasted!" — it somehow captures the spirit of astonishment and shock.</p></div></div>`;
