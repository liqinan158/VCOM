To make white rice, the <i>husk</i> is removed from the plant, leaving behind a smooth grain.</p><p class="long">When you hear the word <i>husk</i>, you may think of the thick leaves that cover an ear of corn. Any vegetable, legume, seed, or fruit with a protective covering has a husk, which is also called a <i>hull</i> or <i>chaff</i>. You can use this word as a verb, too: "Are you going to husk all that corn by yourself? It's almost time for dinner!" Some etymologists trace this word back to the Dutch <i>huuskyn</i>, "little house."</p></div></div>`;
