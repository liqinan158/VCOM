The scale is named for its inventor, a German physicist named Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit, who developed it in 1724. Until the 1960s, Fahrenheit was the most widely-used scale for measuring temperature. Today, Americans using British recipes, for example, have to translate Celsius to Fahrenheit before setting their ovens.</p></div>`;
