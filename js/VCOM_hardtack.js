The taste and texture of <i>hardtack</i> wasn't popular, but it lasted a long time without spoiling.</p><p class="long">If you take a close look at the word <i>hardtack</i>, you'll have a clear sense of how sailors felt about having to eat it day after day. The <i>hard</i> part is accurate â€” it was so dry and tough that it was difficult to bite. <i>Tack</i> once meant "food," but in dialect it was specifically "bad food." Hardtack had many alternate names, including "soda crackers" and "sea biscuits," but also "dog biscuits" and "molar breakers."</p></div>`;
