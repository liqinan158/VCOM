Animals that have <i>tusks</i> can use them for protection against predators.</p><p class="long"><i>Tusk</i> rhymes with <i>dusk</i>. A tusk is a tooth that grows outward from an animal's mouth. How is a tusk different from a fang? Fangs are used to seize prey and bite and tear. Tusks, on the other hand, are used for defense and even as tools for digging or, in the cause of the walrus, for holding steady while on ice.</p></div></div>`;
