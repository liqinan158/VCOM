A bad omen — like a black cat — can be called a jinx, or the resulting bad fortune itself might be referred to that way. <i>Jinx</i> is also a verb, meaning "to subject to bad luck." In the 17th century the word was <i>jyng</i>, which also meant a bird called a "wryneck," used in witchcraft.</p></div>`;
