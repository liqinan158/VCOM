Your conscience can <i>prick</i> you as well, when it makes you feel uncomfortable about something. <i>Prick</i> is also a vulgar term for a man's penis and a way to address someone (usually a man) who is acting like a total ass. It is best not to use these terms in polite company.</p></div></div>`;
