The design of a building can be uncluttered, lacking fancy decorative details, and your friend's uncluttered jewelry design is likewise sleek and plain. An uncluttered room specifically lacks <i>clutter</i>, disarray or collections of things strewn around. And if your mind is uncluttered, it's free of unwanted emotions and thoughts.</p></div></div>`;
