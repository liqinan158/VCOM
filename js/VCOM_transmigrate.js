Your soul, some people believe, will <i>transmigrate</i> into a new body after death.</p><p class="long">Another way to say <i>transmigrate</i> is <i>reincarnate</i>, or be born again after death. Many religions believe that people transmigrate after they die, including Buddhism and Hinduism as well as some Native American beliefs. Rarely, the verb <i>transmigrate</i> is used to mean "move to a new country," although <i>migrate</i> is much more common. The root is the Latin word <i>transmigrat</i>, "move from one place to another," from the prefix <i>trans</i>, "across or beyond," and <i>migratus</i>, "to move."</p></div>`;
