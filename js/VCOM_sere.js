The desert climate, for example, is <i>sere</i>, as is your skin after a day in the wind.</p><p class="long"><i>Sere</i>’s shriveled and withered meaning crops up in things like Shakespeare's <i>Macbeth</i> ("My way of life Is fall’n into the <i>sere</i>, the yellow leaf;" 5:III), or in archaic references to Sere-month (August), but it isn't frequently used in modern conversation. The variant spelling of <i>sere</i> is <i>sear</i>, which has other meanings that see more modern use.</p></div></div>`;
