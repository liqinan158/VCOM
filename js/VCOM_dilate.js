When the light fades, the pupil of your eye will <i>dilate</i>, meaning it looks bigger.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>dilate</i> comes from the Latin word <i>dilatare</i>, which means “enlarge” or “spread out.” When something stretches, expands, or becomes wider, it is said to dilate. Usually the word <i>dilate</i> is used when the opening of something circular becomes larger, but every so often you might hear someone refer to the need to dilate someone's understanding of quantum physics, global warming, livestock breeding, or any other topic.</p></div>`;
