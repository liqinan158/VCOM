It's a sugar, strictly speaking (you can tell that from the <i>-ose</i> suffix, used in chemical names of sugars such as <i>glucose</i> and <i>fructose</i>). But unlike table sugar, or even the sugars in fruit, xylose doesn't cause a sharp spike in blood sugar when you consume it. In large quantities, however, xylose-sweetened foods can cause digestive upset. So take it easy on that sugar-free gum!</p></div>`;
