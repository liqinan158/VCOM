If you're having a big barbecue party but would rather hang out with your friends than grill, you could pay someone to <i>cater</i> it.</p><p class="long">In Middle English, the food supply in a big household was known as the <i>cates</i>, and so to <i>cater</i> meant keeping the pantry full. These days, caterers don't do pantries. They cook food for many different households or offices. <i>Cater</i> has also come to mean "giving what is desired or needed." You might cater to your grandfather by bringing him tea, reading to him, and laughing at his bad jokes.</p></div>`;
