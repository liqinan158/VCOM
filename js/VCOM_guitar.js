When you play the <i>guitar</i>, you press the strings with one hand to make a note, and strum with the other hand (unless, of course, you are playing air <i>guitar</i>).</p><p class="long">The section of a guitar where your fingers form a note is called the "fingerboard." An acoustic guitar has a hollow body that vibrates with warm sound when you pluck or strum the strings, and an electric guitar is solid and plugs into an amplifier that projects the sound. The word <i>guitar</i> comes from the Spanish <i>guitarra</i>, which has its roots in the Greek <i>kithara</i>, a lyre-like stringed instrument.</p></div>`;
