Sobriquets are often but not always humorous, so in order to pronounce this word, you might want to remember that the last syllable rhymes with <i>play</i>.  Sobriquets are usually given to you by other people, but you can choose one for yourself if you want. If your name is Jennifer and you tend to introduce yourself as Jen, this also qualifies as a sobriquet.</p></div></div>`;
