Your neighborhood's <i>wine bar</i> might have a window full of plants and tables with people sipping wine from big glasses.</p><p class="long">People who enjoy drinking wine may prefer to visit a wine bar rather than a regular bar if they like ordering wine by the glass, sampling wine from different bottles.
