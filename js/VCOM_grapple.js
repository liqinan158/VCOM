If you think about how awkward it would be to harvest grapes, with the individual grapes ready to scatter everywhere, it makes sense that <i>grapple</i> eventually evolved to include a verb form used to describe struggling with something unruly. You might grapple with a budget shortfall, grapple for answers, grapple with a wrestling opponent, or grapple with a new technology.</p></div></div>`;
