The origin of the word <i>proclivity</i> supports this feeling. <i>Proclivity</i> comes from the Latin word <i>proclivis</i>, which literally means "sloping forward." You slide toward a proclivity — no effort is needed. You just give in to it, since you're headed in that direction naturally.</p></div>`;
