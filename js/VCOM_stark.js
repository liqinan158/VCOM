A barren desert or a room with no furniture or curtains is stark. It can also mean "severe, stern, or austere," like the stark beauty of the rocky cliffs in the west of Ireland. <i>Stark</i> can also be used to mean "totally." If you are called stark, raving mad, there's no question about it: you are acting completely crazy.</p></div></div>`;
