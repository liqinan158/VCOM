Delve deeper into the history of this four-syllable word and you'll find the Greek term <i>prophulaktikos</i>, which means to "guard before." <i>Prophylactic</i> can also describe a contraceptive used to prevent pregnancy. This use of the word started because condoms, which are prophylactics, were originally designed to prevent disease, not pregnancy.</p></div></div>`;
