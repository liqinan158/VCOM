If the wind feels unexpectedly chilly this morning, you can put up the hood of your sweatshirt and pull the <i>drawstring</i> tight.</p><p class="long">You might find a drawstring in the hood of your coat, the waist of your sweatpants, or the opening in your backpack. Typically, a drawstring hangs loose unless it's tightened or tied shut. Most drawstrings are laced through loops of material, or into a tube, like the waist of a skirt. Little kids' clothes can't legally have drawstrings, since they're considered hazardous.</p></div></div>`;
