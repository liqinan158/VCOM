He or she is the one to visit if you feel a tightness in your chest and shortness of breath.</p><p class="long">We know that the suffix <i>-ologist</i> refers to someone who studies some area. To that, we add <i>cardio-</i>, which comes from the Greek <i>kardia</i>, meaning "heart," and we get "someone who studies the heart." The actual study of the heart is called <i>cardiology</i>, with <i>cardiologist</i> coming along a few years later. Besides treating the heart, a cardiologist is also concerned with the circulatory system, including arteries and veins.</p></div></div>`;
