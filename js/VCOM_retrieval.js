When you throw a tennis ball to Fido and he brings it back to you, that's <i>retrieval</i>.</p><p class="long">When you lose something and get it back, that's retrieval, whether it's a tote bag you accidentally left at the library or a file you can't find on your computer. In fact, the word <i>retrieval</i> is a common one in computer science, meaning "the act of accessing information." The word comes from the verb <i>retrieve</i>, which was first used in the fifteenth century to describe a hunting dog bringing a dead bird back from a field.</p></div></div>`;
