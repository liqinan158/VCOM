If you have a rare disease, your doctor's <i>therapy</i> will hopefully cure you.</p><p class="long"><i>Therapy</i> comes from the Greek <i>θεραπεία</i>, for "healing." If someone tells you she's "in therapy," she's probably talking about a psychological kind of healing. But if she's getting physical therapy, then she's getting help with a bone or muscle problem. If someone suggests an experimental therapy, that's a mode of treatment that's new. Sometimes if something non-medical makes you feel better, we call it a kind of therapy. You might like chocolate therapy, for example.</p></div></div>`;
