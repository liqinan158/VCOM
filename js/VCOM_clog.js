var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">clog</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>clog</i> is a blockage, or something that gets in the way. A <i>clog</i> in your kitchen sink might mean you have to call a plumber before you can wash your dishes.</p><p class="long">A clog obstructs water from flowing through pipes, and it can also be figurative, like a clog in your city's restaurant inspection system that makes it impossible for people to open new cafes. When <i>clog</i> is a verb, it means to cause such a hindrance. A completely different kind of clog is a heavy, wooden-soled shoe. In the 14th century, a <i>clogge</i> was a "lump of wood," and the verb first meant, "hinder with a block of wood."</p></div></div>`;
