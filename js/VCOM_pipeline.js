A <i>pipeline</i> can also be a channel for other things, even ideas. The Internet is an information <i>pipeline</i>. No digging required!</p><p class="long">While oil and natural gas often go through a pipeline, other substances are also transported this way, including water used for irrigation and even, in some cases, beer. You can use <i>pipeline</i> when you talk about other quick-moving things, like a source of goods, or even spoken communication. You could call the big companies in your city a kind of “job <i>pipeline</i>.” If you have an idea for a community pool in the pipeline, go ahead and hire the lifeguards!</p></div>`;
