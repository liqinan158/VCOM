When you're camping, it's a good idea to put a <i>tarp</i> on the damp ground before you set up your tent.</p><p class="long">Since 1906, the word <i>tarp</i> has been a common shorthand for <i>tarpaulin</i>. Today tarps are just as likely to be made from vinyl or polyethylene, but they were once uniformly heavy canvas that had been treated with tar to make it water resistant. Tarps are used for yard work, to cover furniture while a room is being painted, or to cover the bed of a truck, among many other uses.</p></div>`;
