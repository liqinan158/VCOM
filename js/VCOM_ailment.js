Some other common <i>ailments</i> are allergies or chronic headaches. They can be a real pain. Literally.</p><p class="long">The word <i>ailment</i> comes from the Old English <i>eglan</i> meaning "to trouble, plague, afflict," and the suffix <i>-ment</i> from the Latin <i>mentum</i>, which when added to the end of word describing an action turns that word into the result of that action. So the result of something that troubles, plagues or afflicts you is an ailment â€” a pain or discomfort that just doesn't seem to go away.</p></div>`;
