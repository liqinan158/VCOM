var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">bilious</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If an unpleasant meal has left you feeling grumpy and looking green, you're <i>bilious</i> in several senses of the word. This adjective can mean both "troubled by indigestion" and "irritable," and it can also be used to suggest a sickly green shade.</p><p class="long">The wonderfully descriptive word <i>bilious</i> comes from the root <i>bile</i>, which is a foul green fluid made in the liver and stored in the gall bladder â€” a fact that helps us picture something described as <i>bilious</i> as being really foul. Because of the connection with bile, we often refer to something that's an ugly shade of green as being <i>bilious</i>. Of course, the word can also be more kindly applied to someone who has a liver or gall bladder disorder.</p></div>`;
