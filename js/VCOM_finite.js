Preparing for a standardized test might be unpleasant, but you have to remember that the work is <i>finite</i>; you won't be doing it forever.</p><p class="long">Most people are far more familiar with the word <i>finite</i> when they see it inside the word <i>infinite</i>, or without end. <i>Finite</i> can be used for conceptual things, like time: "Life is finite, so we should live it to the fullest." It can also be used for more tangible things: "We have to be careful with the cooking, we only have a finite amount of fuel." You might want to think of things being finito — a word that looks a lot like <i>finite</i> — to remember that it means, "with an end."</p></div>`;
