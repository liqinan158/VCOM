An <i>anthropophagus</i> is a cannibal.</p><p class="long"><i>Cannibal</i> has such a scary, chilling sound and <i>man-eater</i> sounds more like a femme fatale these days. If you need to characterize an eater of human flesh in a more technical, less emotion-ridden way, you might use this Greek-derived word. The first half of this word relates to humans (much like <i>anthropology</i>) while the second half appears in many words related to eating. With luck, the only place youâ€™ll ever run into an anthropophagus is in a book.</p></div></div>`;
