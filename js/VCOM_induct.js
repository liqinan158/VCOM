The word is typically used to describe official acceptance of a position or admittance into an organization, such as a professional society. It can also be used to describe someone who has formally enrolled in the military. Don't use it for informal joining, though â€” you wouldn't induct a new friend or be inducted at the gym where you have just started a membership.</p></div></div>`;
