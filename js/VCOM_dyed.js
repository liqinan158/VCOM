If your best friend has bright pink hair, you can be sure it's <i>dyed</i>.</p><p class="long">If your 80 year-old grandfather still has the same pitch black hair he had when he was 20, it may be dyed, and when you can't stand the color of your pale yellow curtains, after you dye them you may be more fond of your new dyed curtains. The adjective <i>dyed</i> comes from the verb <i>dye</i>, which until the 19th century was also spelled <i>die</i> â€” today, this spelling means "stop living."</p></div>`;
