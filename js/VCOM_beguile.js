Someone who <i>beguiles</i> is tricky and often charming, like when a smooth-talking friend tries to <i>beguile</i> you into giving them your allowance.</p><p class="long">The word <i>beguile</i> is from Middle English, and while <i>guile</i> involves deceit, to <i>beguile</i> means to spend time pleasantly, even if it involves trickery. If someone beguiles you for an afternoon, you were amused, entertained, or otherwise pleased. The word can also have a darker tone, as when the person who beguiled you for the afternoon was actually trying to steal your car. Con artists and cat videos tend to beguile people.</p></div></div>`;
