Revues were particularly popular in the early part of the 20th century, until the mid-1930s, and audiences attended them both for the funny, topical sketches as well as to see women dancing in scanty clothes. The earliest meaning of <i>revue</i> was "show presenting a review of current events."</p></div>`;
