Are you serious about finishing that art project by tomorrow?

A player shooting a marble would place a knuckle on the floor or ground to get in the proper position. Likewise, someone getting started on a serious task needs to knuckle down. English has many idiomatic phrases that also mean "get ready to work hard," from <i>roll up your sleeves</i> to <i>pull up your socks</i>.</p></div></div>`;
