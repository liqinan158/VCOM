So you might carefully tuck in your sheets and comforter only to watch your puppy jump on the bed and dishevel them. Or you might reach over and dishevel your little brother's curls when he's looking particularly adorable. The adjective <i>disheveled</i> came first, from the Old French <i>descheveler</i>, "disarrange the hair."</p></div>`;
