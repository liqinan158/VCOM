If you've got a contagious disease, your doctor may recommend confinement to your hospital room. Puppies sometimes prefer confinement in a crate to sleeping in an open room. You may also come across an old-fashioned use of the word <i>confinement,</i> referring to a woman in childbirth, which goes back to when women retired to their rooms to give birth and recuperate. <i>Confinement</i> contains the Latin root <i>finis,</i> "end, limit” — confinement certainly is limiting.</p></div>`;
