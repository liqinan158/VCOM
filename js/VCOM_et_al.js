var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">et al</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The scholarly <i>et al.</i> means "and others." Say youâ€™ve got an article written by Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young. You can take a scholarly shortcut and refer to them as "Crosby <i>et al.</i>."</p><p class="long">The phrase is an abbreviation for the Latin <i>et alii</i>. You don't need a period after <i>et</i>, since that's the whole word, but you do need a period with <i>al.</i>. Something else you need to know is that you don't use a comma between the proper name and the abbreviation, just as you wouldn't use a comma if you were writing "Crosby and others." And one last thing: you don't usually italicize <i>et al.</i>, even though it's Latin.</p></div></div>`;
