If you can't stand peas, you might wrinkle your nose in <i>disgust</i> when you are served a bowl of pea soup.</p><p class="long"><i>Disgust</i> is both a noun and a verb. As a noun, it's a reaction to something you think is gross or terrible, like showing your disgust at a movie by getting up and leaving. As a verb, <i>disgust</i> means "to offend," like when your class's bad behavior at the assembly disgusts all the teachers, or "to gross out or revolt." If you pick your nose in public, you will disgust everyone around you.</p></div>`;
