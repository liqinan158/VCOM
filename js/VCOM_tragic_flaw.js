The term <i>tragic flaw,</i> which originally was used strictly in a literary sense, is now commonly used to refer to anyone whose baser nature gets the better of them. Shakespeare's plays are full of such unfortunate people, perhaps most famously Othello â€” who, thanks to his rabid jealousy and a little misunderstanding about a handkerchief, ended up killing the love of his life.</p></div></div>`;
