You should always be sure you know how <i>deep</i> a swimming pool is before demonstrating your backward somersault dive.</p><p class="long">Water can be deep or shallow, and exactly how deep it is can be measured. You can also describe a space not made of water as <i>deep</i> â€” like when you discover a little house made of candy deep, or far, in the woods. Things can even be figuratively deep when they are extreme, like "<i>deep</i> thoughts" or a "<i>deep</i> recession." The Old English word <i>deop</i> means "deep," but it also means, "awful, mysterious, and solemn."</p></div></div>`;
