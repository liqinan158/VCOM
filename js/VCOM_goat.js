Farmers raise <i>goats</i> for milk, wool, and meat â€” as well as for their skill at clearing weeds from fields.</p><p class="long">Goats aren't perfect pets because they'll nibble on just about anything, including paper, clothing, rope, outdoor furniture, and your flower garden. A well-fed goat, however, won't eat tin cans and newspaper, although they'll happily clear the poison ivy out of your yard. Goats, which are close relatives of sheep, are among the oldest domesticated animals. The Proto-Indo-European root of <i>goat</i> also means "to play."</p></div></div>`;
