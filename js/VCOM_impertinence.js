Sometimes you might think you're being funny or playful, but what you're saying can come across as impertinence to someone who expects to be treated with respect. The Latin root is <i>impertinentem</i>, or "not belonging." When someone shows impertinence, they act in a way that doesn't belong, or fit the situation.</p></div></div>`;
