If you know French, <i>fease-, faise-</i> will ring a bell, as it often means "to do." You can probably then infer that <i>malfeasance</i> means "to do bad." Today, it's usually a bad deed done by an official or an organization. You wouldn't accuse a dog who peed on the carpet of malfeasance, but you would accuse a mayor who took a bribe of malfeasance.</p></div></div>`;
