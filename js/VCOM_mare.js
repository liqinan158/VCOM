If your new horse is a filly, a female baby horse, she'll grow up to be a <i>mare</i>.</p><p class="long">Horse experts have many words to distinguish the age and sex of their animals, from <i>foal</i>, for any newborn horse, to <i>stallion</i>, a full grown male, to <i>colt</i>, a young male horse. Mares are known for being more easy-going than stallions, and because they're equally fast and powerful, they're as likely as males to be used for racing. Another meaning of <i>mare</i> ("sea" in Latin) is "dark areas of the moon," once believed to be actual oceans.</p></div></div>`;
