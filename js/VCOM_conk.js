You can also <i>conk</i> your own head on a low-hanging light fixture or cabinet door.</p><p class="long"><i>Conk</i> is an informal way to say "hit" or "bang," especially when it's someone's head bumping into something. You can also conk out, or collapse from exhaustion â€” and your motorcycle can also conk out, when it breaks down. Originally, <i>conk</i> meant "punch in the nose," from 19th century slang for "nose," <i>conk</i>. Later, the word became World War I military slang, for the sound a stalling plane engine makes when it "<i>conks</i> out."</p></div>`;
