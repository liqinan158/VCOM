It can help you remember what commercialism is if you remember that commercials try to sell you things. Commercialism puts profits above all, so sometimes people use this word in a negative sense. For example, people complain about commercialism at Christmas, saying the religious meaning gets drowned out by the message to buy.</p></div></div>`;
