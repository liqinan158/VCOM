This drug causes a temporary loss of feeling, making it your best friend if the drill has to be used.</p><p class="long">The word <i>anesthetic</i> traces back to the Greek word <i>anaisthēsia</i>, from a combination of <i>an-</i>, meaning “without” and <i>aisthēsis</i>, meaning “sensation.” If you take an <i>anesthetic</i> that’s what happens: you are temporarily without sensation, meaning you feel no pain. A general <i>anesthetic</i> causes temporary unconsciousness and is often used during surgeries. A local <i>anesthetic</i> numbs just one area, such your mouth or a finger.</p></div>`;
