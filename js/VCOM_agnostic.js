Your grandmother might be a devout believer, while your mom is <i>agnostic</i>.</p><p class="long">In 1869, English biologist T.H. Huxley coined this noun referring to someone whose religious beliefs lie somewhere in between those of a theist and an atheist â€” that is, a believer and a disbeliever. Huxley combined the Greek prefix <i>a-</i>, meaning "not," with <i>gnostos</i>, "known." This word can be used as a noun or  adjective, and it can also refer to uncertainty about questions other than the existence of God: "Some philosophers remain agnostic as to whether people have free will."</p></div>`;
