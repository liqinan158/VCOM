var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">surprised</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If you are taken unawares by something unexpected, you can describe that feeling with the adjective <i>surprised</i>. Look <i>surprised</i> when your friends plan a party without telling you, even if you see the cars in the driveway and know what's going on.</p><p class="long"><i>Surprised</i> originally meant attacked unexpectedly. It was from the Old French <i>surprendre</i> meaning to overtake, with the root <i>prendere</i> from the Latin word for seize. <i>Surprised</i> has synonyms in words like <i>astonished</i>, <i>amazed</i>, and <i>flabbergasted</i>, but the latter three convey a greater sense of shock or bewilderment. You are <i>surprised</i> by the party, <i>amazed</i> that your old friend came, and <i>flabbergasted</i> to learn she is actually your sister.</p></div>`;
