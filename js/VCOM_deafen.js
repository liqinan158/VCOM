var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">deafen</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>deafen</i> is to make someone permanently or temporarily unable to hear, especially with a very loud noise. If the music at a party <i>deafens</i> you, you'll probably go home early.</p><p class="long">Things that might deafen you include a fire truck's siren, your brother blowing his trumpet in your ear, or an explosion. You can also use the word in a more figurative way, when something makes you feel overwhelmed by its loudness: "I'm sick of living on this busy road â€” when the bus goes by, it <i>deafens</i> me!" The earliest verb with this meaning was <i>deaf</i>, which became <i>deafen</i> by the late 16th century.</p></div>`;
