Many college fraternities are named after two or three Greek letters, often including an <i>alpha</i>.</p><p class="long">Scientists frequently use <i>alpha</i> to mean the first item in a list or series, or the most important item in a group. An uppercase alpha looks identical to a capital <i>A</i>, while the lowercase version is similar but not identical to a small <i>a</i>: <i>Î±</i>. The Greek <i>alpha</i> comes from the Hebrew and Phoenician <i>aleph</i>, a form of the word for "ox," <i>eleph</i>, possibly because the character resembled an ox's head.</p></div></div>`;
