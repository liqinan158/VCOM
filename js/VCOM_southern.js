But if you call a group of people “y’all,” you might be <i>Southern</i>, a word which refers to the American South and usually gets a capital “S” — and a side of hush puppies.</p><p class="long">A southern breeze happens when wind is moving from the south to the north, and the Southern Hemisphere is south of the equator. When <i>southern</i> refers to the direction, it’s not capitalized; when it's used in the name of specific place, however, it is capitalized. <i>Southern</i> comes from <i>south</i>, which derives from a Germanic word meaning "sun-side."</p></div></div>`;
