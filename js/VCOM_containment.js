If you get chicken pox, you won't be allowed back in school until you're not contagious anymore. Your school's aiming for <i>containment</i> of the disease by keeping you away from everyone else.</p><p class="long">Containment is also a foreign policy strategy. If one country is stirring up trouble by sending weapons and fighters into neighboring countries, other countries can join together and enact a policy of containment, to isolate the rogue country and keep it from causing chaos outside its borders. In a nuclear reactor, the containment system is the back-up system that's supposed to keep dangerous radiation from leaking out into the atmosphere or water when there's an accident.</p></div>`;
