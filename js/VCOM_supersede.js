A longer description will supplant, or <i>supersede</i>, by replacing this brief one.</p><p class="long">Most words that include <i>super</i> have something good going on. <i>Supersede</i> is from the 16th-century Latin for "sit on top," and it often means to replace with something better. A version 10 of a computer game will <i>supersede</i>, version 9, making it more exciting. Unfortunately, a person might be replaced too, as in "the younger running back will supersede the veteran player as he gets older." To <i>supersede</i> is generally a good thing, but being superseded is not always that great for the replaced person.</p></div>`;
