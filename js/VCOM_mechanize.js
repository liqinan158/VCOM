If youâ€™re tired of pedaling uphill, <i>mechanize</i> your bike by putting a motor on it.</p><p class="long">Whenever someone uses automation or technology to do work that was previously done by humans, they mechanize that work. Throughout history, and especially since the Industrial Revolution, inventors have mechanized jobs that were once done by hand. Factories mechanize processes such as making glass bottles, once done more slowly and laboriously by glassblowers. <i>Mechanize</i> is rooted in the Greek <i>mekhanikos</i>, which means "inventive" or "pertaining to machines."</p></div>`;
