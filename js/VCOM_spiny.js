They're all spiny for the same reasonâ€”as a defense against predators. The barbs or thorns themselves are called <i>spines</i>, from the Latin <i>spina</i>, meaning "backbone" and also "thorn or prickle." You can also use <i>spiny</i> figuratively to describe something difficult to deal with: "It was a <i>spiny</i> problem indeed."</p></div>`;
