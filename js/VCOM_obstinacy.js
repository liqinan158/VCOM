If you’ve ever watched a persistent two-year-old who wants something she’s been denied, you’ve witnessed <i>obstinacy</i> at its purest.</p><p class="long">Adults show obstinacy too of course, when they refuse to be moved or change their mind. <i>Obstinacy</i> can also refer to a situation or trait that is hard to overcome, as in the <i>obstinacy</i> of a physics problem that will not be solved or molasses that will not be stirred. <i>Obstinacy</i> is a noun for obstinate behavior — it can also be called <i>bullheadedness</i>, <i>pigheadedness</i>, <i>willfulness</i>, and plain old <i>stubbornness</i>.</p></div></div>`;
