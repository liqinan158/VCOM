The first is something  living such as an alien or an angel, whereas the latter is an inanimate object such as a star or a planet. Both, however, are from the sky.</p><p class="long">The word <i>celestial</i> is primarily used to describe things that have to do with the heavens such as angels, spirits, stars and planets. It does not come from words meaning God or soul though, but from the Latin word for sky <i>caelestis</i>, which also gave rise to the word <i>ceiling</i>. So really, all you have to do is look up and you'll remember what <i>celestial</i> means â€” whether you're inside or outside.</p></div>`;
