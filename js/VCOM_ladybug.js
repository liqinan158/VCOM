Some people think it's good luck when a <i>ladybug</i> lands on them.</p><p class="long">Scientifically, the ladybug is known as a <i> coccinellid</i>, one of a family of insects that are generally brightly colored and spotted. They are sometimes also called "lady birds" or "lady cows." Gardeners love them because they tend to eat pesky bugs like aphids that feed on plants and flowers. The <i>lady</i> part of their name refers to the Bible's Virgin Mary, named for the red cape she wears in many well-known paintings.</p></div>`;
