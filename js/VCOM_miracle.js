Catching that foul ball from the stands at the World Series? A miracle!</p><p class="long"><i>Miracle</i>, a noun meaning “amazing or wonderful occurrence," comes from the Latin <i>miraculum</i> “object of wonder."  Dig way back and the word derives from <i>smeiros</i>, meaning "to smile," which is exactly what you do when a miracle happens. To quote the American-French author Anais Nin, “The dream was always running ahead of me. To catch up, to live for a moment in unison with it, that was the miracle.” Just ask any rock star.</p></div>`;
