That’s from an ‘80s rap song and it means a party is rocking. A <i>roof</i> is a building's cover. It keeps the rain out of your house party.</p><p class="long">The roof on your house or apartment building keeps rain, snow, and harsh sunlight out. Vehicles have roofs too: "I could hear sleet hitting the car <i>roof</i>," and so do enclosed spaces like porches or caves. You might even refer to the fact that you have a home as "having a <i>roof</i> over my head." As a verb, to <i>roof</i> means "to install a <i>roof</i>." When you "raise the <i>roof</i>," you make a lot of festive noise.</p></div>`;
