var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">relieve</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>relieve</i> is to ease a burden or take over for someone. An aspirin can <i>relieve</i> a headache, and a substitute can <i>relieve</i> the teacher who fell asleep on her desk after lunch.</p><p class="long"><i>Relieve</i> comes from the Latin word <i>relevare</i> meaning "to help" or "make light again." An ice pack might relieve a pain in your elbow, but you can also be relieved of your duties if you get fired (or taken out to lunch). A thief might even relieve you of your wallet. Like <i>thief</i>, <i>relieve</i> is the rare word that actually follows the "i" before "e" rule ("i" before "e" except after "c" or when sounded as "a" as in "neighbor" and "weigh"). Aren't you relieved?</p></div></div>`;
