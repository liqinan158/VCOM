You might <i>impress</i> a print onto canvas, or you might <i>impress</i> prospective employers in a job interview. Whether that impression will be good or bad is up to you!</p><p class="long">The past participle of the Latin verb <i>imprimere</i>, "to press," is <i>impressus</i>, which evolved in the 14th Century to the meaning "to make a permanent image."  That meaning included a figurative meaning of "to impress upon the mind or heart."  <i>Impress</i> also means conscription into the military, or taking people to serve against their will â€” in other words, the draft.</p></div>`;
