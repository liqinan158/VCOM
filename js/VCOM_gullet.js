When you eat a cupcake, it moves from your mouth to your pharynx, and then to your <i>gullet</i>.</p><p class="long">The gullet is an important part of your digestive system, linking your mouth and stomach, and also one of the earliest steps in the digestive process. Muscles in the gullet contract and relax, helping to push food along, a process that's called <i>peristalsis</i>. <i>Gullet</i> comes from the Old French <i>golet</i>, "neck of a bottle," from the Latin <i>gula</i>, "throat."</p></div></div>`;
