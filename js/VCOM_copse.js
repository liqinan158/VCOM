A <i>copse</i> of trees can provide a good hiding place during a game of hide-and-seek.</p><p class="long">If you go to your local garden shop and ask about how to take care of your copse, you may get some blank stares, as it's not a word you'll find much in everyday use. The word first appeared in the late 16th century, as a shortened form of <i>coppice</i>, a word still used in British English, referring to an area with trees or shrubs that are periodically cut back to the ground so that they grow back thicker.</p></div>`;
