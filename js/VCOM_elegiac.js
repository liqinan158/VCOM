Sometimes <i>elegiac</i> specifically refers to something or someone that's gone: a person who's died, or a time in the past, especially if you feel a sense of longing for it. You can speak in an elegiac way, or sing an elegiac tune. The word comes from the Greek <i>elegos</i>, "poem or song of lament."</p></div>`;
