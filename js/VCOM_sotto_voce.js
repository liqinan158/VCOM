If you're unsure of the lyrics, you can also sing a song <i>sotto voce</i>.</p><p class="long">This handy Italian phrase can be used as an adverb: "'Don't look now, but there's an alpaca behind you,' she said sotto voce." It's also fine to use it as an adjective: "I liked the sotto voce part of your karaoke performance best." <i>Sotto voce</i>, literally "under the voice," comes from the Latin words <i>subtus</i>, "below," and <i>vocem</i>, "voice."</p></div>`;
