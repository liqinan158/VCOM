Or, you may meet a <i>minister</i> of the government kind — a prime <i>minister</i> or a <i>minister</i> of finance, for example.</p><p class="long">You don't have to be religious to minister. When you minister to someone, you take care of them. All of these meanings of <i>minister</i> — both as a noun and as a verb — contain a grain of the original Latin meaning, "servant." A minister in a church serves his or her flock, and a prime minister serves his or her country.</p></div>`;
