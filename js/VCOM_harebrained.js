Sometimes, <i>harebrained</i> ideas work out just fine â€” several people have survived trips over Niagara Falls in a barrel, for example.</p><p class="long">If you have what you think is a great idea, but someone else calls it a harebrained scheme, it means they think you'd be a fool to try it. For example, your harebrained plan to ride your bike on the highway is bound to get you in trouble. The 16th century <i>harebrained</i> came from the earlier <i>harebrain</i>, "giddy or reckless person," from the common impression of a rabbit or a <i>hare</i> as being nervous and skittish.</p></div></div>`;
