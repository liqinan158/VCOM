There’s a wonderfully creepy movie about a man who suffers a <i>grisly</i> death at the hands of the grizzly bears he was studying.</p><p class="long">Do you like grisly horror movies? You might think that the reason the word <i>grisly</i> is so creepy, gruesome, and terrifying is somehow related to <i>gristle</i>, those really nasty tough parts you find in meat. But no, this is not the case. Old English <i>grislic</i>, the root of the word, means "horrible, dreadful." If something is gory and gross, it’s grisly.</p></div>`;
