The noun <i>fusillade</i> describes a quick round of gunfire.</p><p class="long">To correctly pronounce <i>fusillade</i>, say "FEW sill ahd." The word probably reminds you of <i>fuselage</i>, the part of an aircraft where crew members and passengers sit. But the words only sound alike. <i>Fuselage</i> gets its name from its cylinder shape, while <i>fusillade</i> comes from the French word <i>fusil</i>, meaning "musket." <i>Fusillade</i> also can be used in a figurative sense to describe a rapid series of anything, such as a fusillade of punches or a fusillade of questions.</p></div></div>`;
