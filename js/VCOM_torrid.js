If you’re listening to a <i>torrid</i> band, then you’re listening to a band that has a lot of energy.</p><p class="long"><i>Torrid</i> is an adjective that describes something that's extremely hot — in both the literal and the figurative senses. It also describes something that's very energetic, or something that has an extreme emotional charge — which is why people often apply <i>torrid</i> to love affairs. <i>Torrid</i> comes from the Latin word <i>torrere</i>, meaning “parch or scorch.” Being scorched can sometimes be exciting, but when you’re parched, you need water — and maybe a break from dating.</p></div></div>`;
