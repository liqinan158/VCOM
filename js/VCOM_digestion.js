Chewing is an important first step in <i>digestion</i>, because your teeth make food small enough to swallow.</p><p class="long">Your digestion isn't usually something you spend much time thinking about, unless you eat something that upsets your digestion — then the process can be uncomfortable. You can also describe the breakdown of other types of material — when it's exposed to chemicals or bacteria, for example — as <i>digestion</i>. A figurative kind of digestion happens when you think through complicated information and begin to make sense of it all.</p></div></div>`;
