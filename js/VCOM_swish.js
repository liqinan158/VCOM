A bike might <i>swish</i> past you on a wet sidewalk, and you might <i>swish</i> your long dress as you continue walking.</p><p class="long">A <i>swish</i> is the sound that's made when a person or thing swishes — the swish of a dish brush on a dirty pan in the sink, or the swish of water against a dock. A kite swishes through the air and so does a fencing epee or a fly swatter. In basketball, you swish when you make a clean basket, without the ball hitting the rim or the backboard. <i>Swish</i> is an example of onomatopoeia — when a word that sounds like its meaning.</p></div>`;
