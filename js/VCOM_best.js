Most people think Michael Jordan is the best basketball player of all-time, and Wayne Gretzky is the best hockey player ever, but there's not much agreement on who's the best football player or baseball player. <i>Best</i> has other meanings too: If you defeated someone, you bested them. People also use this word to recommend something, as in "It would be best to get a lot of sleep."</p></div></div>`;
