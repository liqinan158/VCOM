A therapist who uses psychoanalytic methods might help you interpret your dreams and explore forgotten childhood events in order to find the unconscious source of your anxious feelings. Psychoanalytic theory is employed outside of psychology, too — it's been used to analyze things like literature and art. <i>Psychoanalytic</i> is rooted in the Greek <i> psykhē</i>, "the soul, mind, or spirit."</p></div>`;
