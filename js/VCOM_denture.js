Some kinds of <i>dentures</i> need to be soaked in a cleansing solution overnight.</p><p class="long">The <i>denture</i> part of a dental appliance is officially the plate to which false teeth are attached, but people tend to refer more generally to <i>dentures</i>, meaning the whole device. If an accident or dental disease causes you to lose adult teeth, you can have a dentist make dentures that are fitted exactly to your mouth. Some of these are permanent, while others are removable. <i>Denture</i> comes from the Latin root <i>dens</i>, "tooth."</p></div>`;
