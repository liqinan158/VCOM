It’s a bird, so people hunt it, which is maybe how <i>grouse</i> came to mean “to complain” a few hundred years later. You might grouse about the amount of homework your social studies teacher assigns or about the terrible weather or about the high price of gas. People will grouse about pretty much anything!</p></div>`;
