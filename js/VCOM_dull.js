So when you’re reading a <i>dull</i> or boring word description, for instance, it can <i>dull</i> or deaden your appetite for reading more word descriptions. That’s pretty fascinating, no? You can even use it for physical things, like a knife, which you can <i>dull</i>, that is, make it less sharp. You can even <i>dull</i> something visual, making it lacking in light, or use it describe pain — you know, the kind that is not sharp, just an ache. Exciting? No — dull.</p></div></div>`;
