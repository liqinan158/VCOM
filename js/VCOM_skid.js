Those new fuzzy socks make it easy to <i>skid</i>, or slide unexpectedly, across the wood floor.</p><p class="long">Does <i>skid</i> sound Scandinavian? Because that's where etymologists think the word came from. It makes sense, since there's all that ice up there. The Vikings were most likely skidding around way before snow tires and anti-lock brakes came about to stop all the slippery fun. But a skid that gets out of control is never any good â€” that's why when someone's life slides into the dumps, you can say they "hit the <i>skids</i>."</p></div>`;
