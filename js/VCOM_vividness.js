If you go back to the house where you lived as a small child, you might be surprised at the vividness of your recollections. And you may be equally surprised at how quickly the vividness of a crazy dream starts to fade once you wake up. More literal is the vividness of something glowing, bright, or colorful.</p></div></div>`;
