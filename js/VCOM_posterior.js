var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">posterior</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the adjective <i>posterior</i> to describe something that's in the back. It’s often used in anatomy — a <i>posterior</i> cerebral artery supplies blood to the back of the brain, and the tail is on the <i>posterior</i> of a fish.</p><p class="long">The prefix <i>post</i> means “after,” and things that are posterior come after the things in the front. The opposite of <i>posterior</i> is <i>anterior</i>, which refers to the front, usually of body parts. You can also use the word <i>posterior</i> to jokingly refer to the part of your body that you sit on — your backside. <i>Posterior</i> is also a formal way to say later in time.</p></div></div>`;
