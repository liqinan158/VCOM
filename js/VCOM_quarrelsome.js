Toddlers are often <i>quarrelsome</i>. So are couples, at least with each other.</p><p class="long">If you know that <i>quarrel</i> means to argue or fight, then this is an easy word to figure out. People who are quarrelsome seem to constantly get in fights. Quarrelsome people are often moody or sensitive: any little thing can get them upset. Other people usually don't like to work with or be around quarrelsome folks. However, any of us can get quarrelsome at times, especially when we're under stress or have an empty stomach.</p></div>`;
