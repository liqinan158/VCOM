From this botanical meaning, <i>offshoot</i> has come to describe anything that starts or grows from something else.</p><p class="long">You can start a whole new plant with a houseplant's offshoot, by putting it in water and waiting for it to grow roots. Another kind of offshoot is a local branch of a library, an offshoot of the central location, or an offshoot of a popular TV show, also called a "spin-off." Interestingly, the earliest definition of <i>offshoot</i>, in the seventeenth century, referred to family trees. It wasn't until 1814 that <i>offshoot</i> was used for actual plants.</p></div></div>`;
