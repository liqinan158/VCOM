If you have a reckless attitude, you aren't concerned about what happens to yourself or others who are affected by your actions. In this usage, <i>reckless</i> is the opposite of considerate. Reckless friends will invite people you don't know to your house because with your parents away, it's party time. Surprise!</p></div></div>`;
