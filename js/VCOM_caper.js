For example, your quest for an American newspaper turned into a <i>caper</i> that took you all over the Irish countryside.</p><p class="long"><i>Caper</i> originates from the Italian word <i>capriolare</i>, meaning “jump in the air,” and indeed, one meaning is "frolicking play or light-hearted dancing." Little kids like to caper at family parties — it gets them tons of attention. Other kinds of capers might get you jail time because a caper can also be an outlandish crime spree, or a wild activity. Finally, capers are the very flavorful pickled flower bud found in Mediterranean cooking.</p></div></div>`;
