If he is caught <i>embezzling</i>, it probably also means that he will soon be unemployed.</p><p class="long">The word <i>embezzle</i> implies more than simply "to steal." When a person embezzles, he or she takes advantage of an employer's trust for personal gain. Embezzling is a so-called "white-collar crime" which often involves some sort of cover-up, like falsifying financial records or stealing small amounts of money over a long period of time. The word <i>embezzle</i> comes from an Old French word meaning "maltreat or ravage," <i>besillier</i>, and an embezzler can be said to ravage someone else's money.</p></div></div>`;
