For example, the individual parts don't matter as much as the <i>overall</i> value.</p><p class="long">The word <i>overall</i> is the sum of its parts. Take the word <i>over</i>, meaning "above," and add it to the word <i>all</i>, meaning "everything" and you get <i>overall</i>, meaning "above everything". But remember, it's an adjective as in the overall impression of the music, the overall effect of the new tax code, the overall direction (as opposed to individual little changes.) Remember that <i>overalls</i>, the clothes you wore as a kid, went "over all" your other clothes.</p></div></div>`;
