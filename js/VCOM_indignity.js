An <i>indignity</i> is usually something that happens to us rather than something we do ourselves.</p><p class="long">As you might guess from that negative prefix <i>in-</i>, an <i>indignity</i> is a word that takes dignity (or self-esteem) away. If you find a fly in your soup, that's an indignity â€” not to mention protein. If you're making a speech and you realize your fly is open, that's a major indignity. Many people find waiting in line a long time to be an indignity. When you say "This is an <i>indignity</i>!" you're really saying, "I'm better than this, and I shouldn't have to deal with it." Needless to say, life is full of indignities.</p></div></div>`;
