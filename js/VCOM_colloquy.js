The word comes from the Latin prefix <i>com-</i>, meaning "together," and <i>loquium</i>, meaning "speaking." That adds up to "speaking together." You probably recognize <i>loqui</i>, meaning "to speak," in words like <i>locution</i> and <i>colloquial</i>, which also involve speaking.</p></div></div>`;
