However, you will most likely NOT hear <i>vitriolic</i> used to describe a chemical reaction. You are more likely to hear <i>vitriolic</i> used to describe caustic words. We've seen some examples in recent political campaigns, and the results are always embarrassing. Avoid using <i>vitriolic</i> language whenever possible, and you will keep your friends — and your dignity.</p></div>`;
