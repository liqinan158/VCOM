Lizards' scales are their integument, and the germ or husk of a seed is its integument. Tissues and coverings inside animals, such as the protective membranes around organs, are another kind of integument. The Latin root is <i>integumentum</i>, "a covering," from <i>integere</i>, "to cover over."</p></div>`;
