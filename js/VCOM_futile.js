Hopefully all the time you're spending studying vocabulary won't turn out to be <i>futile</i>!</p><p class="long"><i>Futile</i> comes from the Latin <i>futilis</i>, which originally meant "leaky." Although we use <i>futile</i> to talk about more than buckets, the image of a leaky vessel is a good illustration of the adjective. Pouring water into a leaky bucket is futile.  Your exercise program will be futile if you don't stop chowing down on chocolate. <i>Futile</i> is fancier than its synonym <i>useless</i>. Other synonyms are <i>fruitless</i> or <i>vain</i>. The <i>i</i> can be either short (FYOO-t'l) or long (FYOO-tile).</p></div>`;
