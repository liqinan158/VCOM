If you buy a pair of jeans at the mall and put them on as soon as you get home, they're <i>ready-to-wear</i>.</p><p class="long">Almost all clothing is ready-to-wear — the opposite is tailor-made clothing, which you can also call <i>bespoke</i> or <i>made to measure</i>. These much fancier and more expensive garments are sewn especially for the wearer's body, while ready-to-wear clothes are more affordable and — inevitably — fit less perfectly. In French, the term is <i>prêt-à-porter</i>, "off the rack" or "off the peg."</p></div></div>`;
