Use <i>potent</i> instead to describe things like intense smells, powerful magic potions, and very influential people.</p><p class="long">From the Latin <i>potentum</i>, meaning “powerful,” <i>potent</i> is just that: having tremendous strength or influence in either a moral or physical sense. A potent question gets to the heart of the matter and sparks serious discussion. Really stiff drinks can be potent, as can your breath after a garlicky meal. And as the composer Igor Stravinsky once asked, "What force is more potent than love?"</p></div>`;
