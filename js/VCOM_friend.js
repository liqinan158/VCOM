Back then you had to be careful to not confuse <i>freond</i> with <i>feond</i>, which meant “fiend or enemy.” These days it's pretty tough to get mixed up though. Friends are the people you can count on, the ones that make you laugh and throw you birthday parties. Enemies are generally the mean ones.</p></div></div>`;
