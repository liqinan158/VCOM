Instead of throwing your worn-out socks away, you can just <i>darn</i> the holes in their toes.</p><p class="long">When you darn your socks or sweaters, you use a needle and thread to close small holes in the woven fabric. There's even a specific stitch known as a "darning stitch," in which you first weave the thread with the grain of the fabric, and then fill in the other "woven" direction. The result is a sturdy patch made only of thread. <i>Darn</i> comes from the Middle French <i>darner</i>, "mend."</p></div></div>`;
