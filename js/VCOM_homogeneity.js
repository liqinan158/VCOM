If you're looking for <i>homogeneity</i> in your wardrobe, you'll want shirts and jeans that all have something similar about them.</p><p class="long"><i>Homogeneity</i> can also mean that something is the same throughout. Plain yogurt has a <i>homogeneity</i> about it — it's white all the way through and it should be the same texture throughout. On the other hand, yogurt with fruit at the bottom can be described as having heterogeneity — different textures and different colors. The Greek root <i>homo-</i>, means "same," and <i>genos</i> means "race" or "kind" — so <i>homogeneity</i> is the quality of being "the same kind."</p></div>`;
