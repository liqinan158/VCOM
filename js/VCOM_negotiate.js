You might <i>negotiate</i> with your mom â€” offering to do more chores for a raise in your allowance. Good luck.</p><p class="long">Negotiation is all about give and take. Governments are always negotiating with unions, trying to define the terms of new contracts. The government might offer the teachers union a raise, if they agree to work 200 days a year instead of 180. The verb <i>negotiate</i> can also mean to successfully pass through or travel along. You may have to negotiate a hazardous road, or a tricky path through sticker bushes.</p></div></div>`;
