An ill-fated attempt at tightrope walking results in falling off over and over again, and an ill-fated choice of lunch in a foreign country might end in food poisoning. <i>Ill-fated</i> is rooted in <i>ill-</i>, "badly," and <i>fated</i>, "be destined to happen," from the Latin <i>fatum</i>, "that which has been spoken."</p></div></div>`;
