A kid might <i>shuffle</i> reluctantly off to his room only after being told five times that it's bedtime.</p><p class="long"><i>Shuffle</i> also means to wiggle around, like if you shuffle uncomfortably in your seat while watching a five-hour movie. If you get lost in the shuffle, youâ€™re lost in the crowd. Another way to use <i>shuffle</i> is to mean "mix up in a random way," as you do with a deck of cards before dealing a hand. <i>Shuffle</i> probably comes from the Low German word <i>schuffeln</i>, which means both "to walk clumsily" and "to deal dishonestly."</p></div></div>`;
