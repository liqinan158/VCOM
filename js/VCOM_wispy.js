If your explanation of why you didn't help your mom paint the kitchen was weak and didn't help her understand your reasons, you'd call that a <i>wispy</i> explanation.</p><p class="long"><i>Wispy</i> can be used more literally to describe things that are physically not very substantial, like the delicate necklace that breaks as soon as you wear it. A person who looks weak and thin could also be described as wispy. A wisp is something flimsy, but in its original meaning, it was a handful of hay or grass â€” again,  something very light.</p></div>`;
