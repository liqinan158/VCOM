Kids often think of their teachers <i>purely</i> as teachers and canâ€™t imagine them outside the classroom. So they get <i>purely</i> confused when they see a teacher at the store.</p><p class="long">Something pure is made up of only one thing, like a pure gold ring. When anything is described as purely occurring or existing, it is similarly strict.  A purely business-related letter is only business. A purely platonic friendship is not romantic at all. A purely bred dog has been bred only with dogs of the same breed. Someone who wants a dog purely for the sake of companionship will not bother with a purely bred dog.</p></div>`;
