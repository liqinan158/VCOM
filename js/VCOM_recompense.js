var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">recompense</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Say you loan a few bucks to a friend who is short on cash, and he wins the lottery. Presumably, he'll be able to <i>recompense</i> you, or pay you back what he owes.</p><p class="long">If you look closely at <i>recompense</i>, you'll see how similar it is to <i>compensate</i>, which means to make amends for something or to pay. Add the prefix <i>re-</i>, which suggests returning or repeating, and you get the meaning of <i>recompense</i> â€” paying back or reimbursing financially or otherwise. <i>Recompense</i> is most often used as a verb, but it works as a noun, too. In recompense for throwing peas and screaming, a mother might send a toddler to her room for a time-out.</p></div>`;
