If your mother calls your miniskirt <i>minuscule</i>, it probably means she wants you to change into something a bit less revealing.</p><p class="long">In <i>minuscule</i>, you see the word, minus, which means lesser. The word <i>minuscule</i> has its roots in the Latin expression <i>minuscula littera</i>, a phrase used to describe the smaller letters in text. In the late 1800s, the use of the word expanded to mean very small in general â€” so the definition of <i>minuscule</i> became less minuscule.</p></div>`;
