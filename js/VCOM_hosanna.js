Usually, <i>hosannas</i> praise God.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>hosanna</i> referring to a cry of praise can claim a long pedigree in English: it first appeared in the 12th century. It's from a Biblical Hebrew phrase meaning "Pray, save us." <i>Hosanna</i> made stops in Greek and Latin before arriving in English in the earliest translations of the Bible. Any kind of thanks and adoration aimed at God could be considered a hosanna. In church, many of the prayers and songs are hosannas.</p></div>`;
