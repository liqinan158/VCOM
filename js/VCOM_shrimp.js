You may be most familiar with the <i>shrimp</i> you order at a seafood restaurant, but there are over 2,000 species of <i>shrimp</i> in the world.</p><p class="long">While many people think of shrimp as a delicious part of a pasta dish or seafood buffet, there's much more to these tiny animals. Shrimp are invertebrates, with hard exoskeletons, antennae, and eyes on long stalks. They live at the bottom of the ocean, where they filter sand and particles for algae and plankton. <i>Shrimp</i> probably comes from the Old Norse <i>skreppa</i>, "thin person," and fittingly, <i>shrimp</i> is also a mildly derogatory term for a small person.</p></div>`;
