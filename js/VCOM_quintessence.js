Some people say that the <i>quintessence</i> of American cuisine is the hamburger. Vegetarians may beg to differ.</p><p class="long">Ancient Greek philosophers claimed there were five elements: earth, water, air, fire, and a fifth substance that made up objects in the heavens. This idea was passed down through the ages to Latin-speaking scholars who called the fifth element <i>quintessence</i> — from the Latin words <i>quintus</i>, meaning “fifth,” and <i>essentia</i>, meaning “being.” Eventually, the word’s meaning evolved into our modern definition of an ideal, a potentially heavenly example of something — you know, like a hamburger.</p></div></div>`;
