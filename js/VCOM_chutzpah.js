It takes <i>chutzpah</i> to stand in front of the whole class and announce that you are a better writer than William Shakespeare.</p><p class="long"><i>Chutzpah</i> is a Yiddish word meaning "impudence or gall." Bravery that borders on rudeness is chutzpah, which rhymes with "foot spa." If you have chutzpah, you say what you think without worrying about hurting someone's feelings, looking silly, or getting in trouble. A display of chutzpah is meant to make a statement, like the chutzpah of the girl who shaves her head in protest of impossible beauty standards.</p></div>`;
