var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">viscid</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The adjective <i>viscid</i> is used to describe something that is sticky or a thick, slow-moving liquid. If you bake bread and you get flour all over your counters, clean it up carefully because adding water can turn the flour into a <i>viscid</i> paste, and then you'll really have a mess!</p><p class="long">The word <i>viscid</i> is from the Latin word <i>viscum</i>, or birdlime. Birdlime is a sticky substance made from sap and is smeared on branches. Small birds land on the branches and are trapped, allowing someone to easily catch them. The word <i>viscous</i> comes from the same root and has a similar meaning â€” think of lava and how it moves slowly and thickly down a mountain.</p></div>`;
