You can also use this word figuratively, to describe something that you relate to — like a <i>resonating</i> speech that affects you personally.</p><p class="long">You can also substitute words like <i>resonant</i> or <i>reverberating</i> for the adjective <i>resonating</i> — they all describe the full, rich sound and feeling of a bass voice or a drum beat. When something is emotionally resonating, it delivers a message that you can relate to on a personal level. Political candidates are always trying to communicate with voters in a resonating manner to gain their votes. <i>Resonating</i> comes from the Latin word <i>resonantia</i>, or "echo," which is rooted in <i>resonare</i>, "to sound again," from <i>re-</i>, "again," and <i>sonare</i>, "to sound."</p></div></div>`;
