The four-year-old who wants a unicorn for her birthday isn't being very pragmatic.</p><p class="long">The opposite of <i>idealistic</i> is <i>pragmatic</i>, a word that describes a philosophy of "doing what works best." From Greek <i>pragma</i> "deed," the word has historically described philosophers and politicians who were concerned more with real-world application of ideas than with abstract notions. A pragmatic person is sensible, grounded, and practical â€” and doesn't expect a birthday celebration filled with magical creatures.</p></div>`;
