It's most commonly given at graduations.</p><p class="long">The word <i>diction</i> in <i>valediction</i> is a clue that this word has to do with speaking, since it comes from the Latin root <i>dicere</i>, "to say." When combined with <i>valere</i>, "be well," the result is <i>valedicere</i>, "bid farewell." Just about any type of school that has a graduation ceremony will have a valediction, which typically congratulates students on their accomplishments and inspires them to look ahead.</p></div></div>`;
