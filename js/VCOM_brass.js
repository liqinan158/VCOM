You'll see <i>brass</i> everywhere once you start looking: in doorknobs, lamps and light fixtures, zippers, and tools.</p><p class="long">Because brass is both workable and strong, it's used in musical instruments (in fact, there's a whole category of instruments known as <i>brass</i>, including saxophones and trumpets). It's also a low-friction metal, so it's preferred for ammunition casings, gears, and locks. And brass is shiny and cheerful, so people like to use it in light fittings, plaques, and sculptures. High-ranking military members are informally known as <i>brass</i>, inspired by the insignia on their uniforms.</p></div></div>`;
