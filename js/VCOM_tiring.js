Digging a hole big enough to plant a tree is tiring, and so is studying for a big math test. You might imagine that the most tiring job would be one in which you do hard physical labor all dayâ€”until you spend a day as a preschool teacher with a class of rambunctious three-year-olds! <i>Tiring</i> comes from the verb <i>tire</i>, "to become weary."</p></div>`;
