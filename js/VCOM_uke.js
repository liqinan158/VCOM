The great thing about playing the <i>uke</i> is that you can bring it with you almost anywhere you go.</p><p class="long">The uke comes in four sizes and tones, ranging from soprano to baritone. The bigger the uke, the deeper and richer its sound. It's fairly easy to learn how to play a uke, so you might want to start a uke band with your friends or serenade your cat with Beatles tunes. To be an expert uke player, however, requires your fingers to move incredibly fast â€” which explains the name <i>ukulele</i>, "leaping flea" in Hawaiian.</p></div></div>`;
