You might check out your hair in the mirror before a party and decide it needs an <i>adornment</i> â€” a hat or a glittery barrette.</p><p class="long">Tinsel draped on a Christmas tree is an adornment, and so are the fuzzy dice hanging on your car's rear view mirror. Lipstick is an adornment, and so is a polka dotted bow tie, since they both dress a person up a little bit. Another way to use <i>adornment</i> is to mean the act or process of decorating: "The <i>adornment</i> of the high school gym had transformed it into a winter wonderland."
