If you call someone <i>virtuous</i>, you are saying that person is living according to high moral standards. Someone <i>virtuous</i> is who you want leading your Girl Scout troop.</p><p class="long">When you use <i>virtuous</i> to describe an action, like, "Your decision to cancel your vacation plans when your mom got sick was <i>virtuous</i>," it’s almost as though you’re referring to an ideal of goodness. In past centuries, <i>virtuous</i> was synonymous with <i>virginal</i>. In many 18th century English novels, for example, a woman didn't even have to be all that nice to be called <i>virtuous</i>; it just mattered that she was sexually innocent.</p></div></div>`;
