If you're like most people, you sip your milkshake through a straw — a long, plastic <i>tube</i>.</p><p class="long">Chemists use glass tubes in labs, and plumbers work with pipes — tubes made of plastic and metal. Another kind of tube is the rubber one inside a tire. If you slide down a snowy hillside on an inflated tire tube, or ride through choppy water while sitting on one, you can also use <i>tube</i> as a verb. Though it's not true in the US, in London the subway is also familiarly known as <i>the Tube</i>.</p></div></div>`;
