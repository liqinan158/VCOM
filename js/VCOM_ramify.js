It can describe things that literally branch out in segments, or it can be used figuratively to describe things that spread, like the effects of a new policy that ramify through your school. <i>Ramify</i> might seem like a strange word, but you probably know the related word <i>ramification</i>, a consequence that stems — or branches — from some other action.</p></div>`;
