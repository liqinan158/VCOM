Your confirmed bachelor friend — who swears he'll never get married — might just like his independence, or he might be a <i>misogamist</i>.</p><p class="long">If you describe yourself as a misogamist, you probably don't accept many wedding invitations, and you certainly won't be getting married any time soon yourself. Some misogamists might hate the idea of being married, while others object to the entire institution of marriage. The key to the word's meaning lies in <i>misos</i>, the Greek word for "hatred," here combined with <i>gamos</i>, or "marriage."</p></div></div>`;
