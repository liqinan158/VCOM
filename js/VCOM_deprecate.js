var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">deprecate</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>deprecate</i> is to show disapproval or to make someone feel unimportant by speaking to them disrespectfully, like seniors who <i>deprecate</i> younger students just for fun.</p><p class="long">To deprecate is to diminish, or to oppose, like when someone deprecates your dream of climbing Mt. Everest by calling it "a little walk up a hill." Some people deprecate themselves, which is called being self-deprecating. People who are self-deprecating downplay their abilities because they are humble â€” or want to appear that way. So if you do climb Everest and you are self-deprecating, you'll say it wasn't such a big deal, even if it was the proudest moment of your life.</p></div>`;
