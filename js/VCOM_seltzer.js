Sometimes people who are trying to drink less soda enjoy drinking <i>seltzer</i> instead.</p><p class="long">Seltzer is simply water with bubbles added, via dissolved carbon dioxide gas. You can also call seltzer "soda water," "sparkling water," or "club soda." In the U.K., <i>seltzer</i> is considered so old-fashioned that it's nearly obsolete, but it's common in the U.S. <i>Soda water</i> is the original name, from the sodium that was once added. <i>Seltzer</i> comes from the German town <i>Selters</i>, famous for its natural mineral springs.</p></div></div>`;
