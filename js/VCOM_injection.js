When you get jabbed in the arm with a tetanus vaccine, that's an <i>injection</i>.</p><p class="long">The medical kind of injection forces a small amount of a drug under the skin or directly into a muscle. Other injections are similar in that they involve a liquid being forced by pressure, like the fuel injection in a car, which pushes gasoline directly into the engine. Since the 1600s, <i>injection</i> has been used to mean "forcing a fluid into a body," from the Latin <i>inicere</i>, "to throw in" or "to throw on."</p></div>`;
