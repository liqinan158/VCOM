An <i>errant</i> bird might end up in northern Canada while his friends fly to southern Mexico for the winter.</p><p class="long">Although <i>errant</i> is commonly used as a synonym for "misbehaving" or "naughty," it also refers to things that are just out of place. An errant bomb can hit a house instead of an army base, and an errant lock of hair can get in your eyes. <i>Errant</i> can be intentional, as in "the <i>errant</i> boys skipped school to go to the movies," or unintentional, as in "an <i>errant</i> snowball hit your neighbor instead of your arch enemy."</p></div></div>`;
