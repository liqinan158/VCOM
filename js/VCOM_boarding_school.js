Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is the fictional <i>boarding school</i> that Harry Potter goes to in the book series. Most are not that exciting.</p><p class="long">If a place offers you room and board, you can eat your meals there and stay overnight. A boarding school does just that — it’s like a regular private school during the day but students don’t go home in the afternoon, they stay. It's similar to how many students go away to college and live in a dormitory, but it happens before college. Some boarding schools are religious or have another philosophy parents wish their children to learn.</p></div></div>`;
