var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">clout</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you speak of someone having <i>clout</i>, it usually means that they communicate a sense of power or influence, particularly in the political sense. "You’ll wanna talk to that big guy over there if you want me to let you in. He’s got <i>clout</i>."</p><p class="long"><i>Clout</i> can also mean to hit someone really hard — either the hit you give (“that’s a big <i>clout</i> he just landed”) or the act of hitting (“she <i>clouted</i> him with a baseball bat”). Of course, the sense of having power and the actual hitting are related, since clout is something to be wielded — either physically or figuratively. Note: it's not just tough guys who have clout. China is said to have "growing economic <i>clout</i>," and Oprah is known to have significant <i>clout</i> in the media industry.</p></div></div>`;
