The phrase can also describe, literally, the way you see what's in front of you depending on where you are when you look at it. If you're standing on the roof of a tall building looking at a city, your point of view is very different from what it would be if you were standing on the ground. In a fictional story, the point of view means the perspective of the narrator, or the person who's telling the story.</p></div>`;
