You may have seen a <i>splendiferous</i> sunset or a <i>splendiferous</i> velvet gown in your day.</p><p class="long">A splendor is a beautiful sight. Splendiferous things are even better: this somewhat silly-sounding word is a term for praising things that are absolutely fantastic, either because they're beautiful or otherwise great. A gorgeous spring day is splendiferous. A delicious dinner is splendiferous. Seeing a friend for the first time in months is splendiferous. As long as you're referring to something great, it could be called splendiferous.</p></div>`;
