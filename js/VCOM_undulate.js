If a sound increases and decreases in pitch or volume like waves, you can say the sound is <i>undulating</i>. When searching for the lost boy, the rescuers' cries <i>undulated</i> through the forest.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>undulate</i> comes from the Latin word <i>undula</i>, which means "wavelet" (<i>unda</i> means "wave"). So any action shown with the verb <i>undulate</i> has that waving sense to it. If something moves in a wavy, pattern, for example, it is said to undulate. The wind might cause prairie grass to undulate, or music might cause hips to undulate.</p></div></div>`;
