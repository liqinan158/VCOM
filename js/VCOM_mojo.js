It’s not a permanent thing, though. You could lose your <i>mojo</i>. It’s literally a magic charm bag, but these days you can have good <i>mojo</i> without all the baggage.</p><p class="long">In the U.S., the word <i>mojo</i> is commonly used to mean "magic" or even simply "control" or "power." If a musician makes a great new album after a couple of poorly reviewed releases, a critic could exclaim, "She's got her <i>mojo</i> back!" You could also admire a candidate running for the Senate, praising her political mojo. Originally, <i>mojo</i> referred to specific African American folk beliefs, from the Gullah word <i>moco</i>, "witchcraft." You’re getting some good vocabulary <i>mojo</i> right now.</p></div>`;
