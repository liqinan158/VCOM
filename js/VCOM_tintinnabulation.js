You can describe similar sounds that way, too â€” like the telephone's tintinnabulation or the tintinnabulation of your sister's silver bracelets tinkling together as she walks. The Latin word <i>tintinnabulum</i> means "bell," and Edgar Allen Poe popularized <i>tintinnabulation</i>'s usage in the aptly named poem "The Bells."</p></div>`;
