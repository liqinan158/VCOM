If you don't pay your rent, eventually your landlord will <i>evict</i> you.</p><p class="long"><i>Evict</i> became part of the English language back in the 1530s. Based on the Latin word <i>evincere</i>, meaning "recover property, overcome and expel, conquer," even then it had a legal process attached to it. Before you evict someone, you have to complete official paperwork, though some landlords may succeed in evicting tenants without following the legal steps.</p></div></div>`;
