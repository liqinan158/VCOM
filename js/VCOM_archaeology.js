Consider the word <i>biology</i>: <i>bios</i> is Greek for "life," so <i>biology</i> is "the study of life." <i>Arkhaios</i> is "ancient." Thus, <i>archaeology</i> is "the study of ancient things." Early archaeologists tended to seek  sensational finds — like Howard Carter, who found King Tut's tomb. Contemporary archaeologists are generally more concerned with reconstructing the lives of everyday people through careful analysis of mundane artifacts — like tools and feeding utensils.</p></div>`;
