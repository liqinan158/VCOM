If you want to show someone you're not happy with his behavior, <i>admonish</i> him.</p><p class="long">Coming to English through Old French from the Latin <i>admonere</i> "to advise, remind," <i>admonish</i> is always used with an eye on improving someone's behavior. The exact meaning of this formal verb varies in intensity depending generally on who is being corrected. If a child or subordinate is being admonished, it means "scold" or "rebuke" whereas if someone admonishes a person with equal standing, <i>warn</i> or <i>advise</i> are closer synonyms.</p></div></div>`;
