When experiencing malaise, ease yourself down on the couch to recover. <i>Malaise</i> is frequently used figuratively to describe slumps that other things go through as well. The 20-year economic malaise in Japan is one example, but you'll also hear of educational malaise, political malaise, and even "a general <i>malaise</i>." Wherever you turn, there's malaise.</p></div></div>`;
