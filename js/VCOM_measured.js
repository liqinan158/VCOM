When you're walking toward a deer in the woods, trying not to scare it off, you'll take slow, <i>measured</i> steps.</p><p class="long">When you meditate, you take measured breaths and pay attention to the inhale and exhale. And your measured strides up the side of a mountain trail will carry you more quickly to the top than short, erratic bursts of walking and stopping. <i>Measured</i> also means "thoughtful" or "careful," like the measured words you use in your delicately worded resignation letter.</p></div></div>`;
