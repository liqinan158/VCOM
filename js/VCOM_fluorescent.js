var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">fluorescent</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>fluorescent</i> bulb gets its light from mercury vapor inside a glass tube. The incandescent bulb — the kind associated with Thomas Edison — has a filament that glows when it's heated.</p><p class="long">You can also use <i>fluorescent</i> to describe something that's so vivid and bright it seems to give off light. <i>Fluorescent</i> is related to the word <i>fluorspar</i>, or <i>fluorite</i>, which is a mineral that glows. Notice the -u- in these words. <i>Fluorescent</i> comes from the Latin <i>fluere</i> "to flow" — <i>fluorspar</i> can be added to welding compounds, for instance, to make them flow more easily. <i>Florescent</i>, without a -u-, means "flowering," from Latin <i>flor-</i>, which is a completely different root.</p></div></div>`;
