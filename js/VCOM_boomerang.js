The primary meaning is the curved stick that returns to its owner after being thrown. Not just anyone can make a boomerang return: it takes practice and skill.   Because a boomerang returns to its original point, itâ€™s also a verb for things that return. This is often used negatively for things you would rather not see again: if a lie boomerangs, it comes back to haunt you.</p></div>`;
