You might describe your favorite elementary school teacher as "my dear <i>lamented</i> Mrs. McGinty."</p><p class="long"><i>Lamented</i> is often used in the phrase "late lamented," which implies that the person you're talking about is dead and that you really miss him or her. Inanimate objects can also be lamented, like the neighborhood book shop that closed, or a magazine you used to read that is no longer in print. The root Latin word is <i>lamentationem</i>, which describes wailing, moaning, and weeping.</p></div>`;
