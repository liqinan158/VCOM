The computer, the television, and video games were all invented in the twentieth <i>century</i>. People are now wondering what the twenty-first <i>century</i> holds for us.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>century</i> comes from the Latin word <i>centuria</i>, which was a group of 100, particularly a group of 100 Roman soldiers (one of 16 such groups in a Roman legion). The word today still can refer to 100 of something. In sports, a century is a score of 100 in a game of cricket. A race of 100 yards or 100 miles is also sometimes called a century. In slang, <i>century</i> can also mean a 100 dollar bill.</p></div></div>`;
