If you have a happy, light, cheerful personality — if you are "bubbly" — you too are <i>effervescent</i>.</p><p class="long">Coming from the Latin <i>effervēscere</i>, the original meaning was more boiling than bubbly, thanks to the <i>ferv</i> part, which means "hot."  The word literally refers to bubbles giving off gas, and any drinks you enjoy that are nose-ticklingly effervescent make bubbles that pop and release into the air. Remember, someone with an effervescent personality is just bubbly, not full of gas!</p></div>`;
