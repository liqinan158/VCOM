Take care of your <i>prefrontal</i> cortex; it controls your personality.</p><p class="long">In an anatomy class, you'd gain a lot of information about the prefrontal cortex, since it's a vital section of the brain. The word <i>prefrontal</i> comes up in discussions of non-human animals as well, usually describing their brains, but sometimes in discussions of the skull, specifically the bones in front of a bird's or reptile's eye socket. <i>Prefrontal</i> combines <i>pre-</i>, "before," with <i>frontal</i>, "being in front," emphasizing the far forward location.</p></div>`;
