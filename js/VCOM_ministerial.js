If your dad is a pastor, he may have to make it clear if he is telling you not to lie as a father, or in his ministerial capacity.</p><p class="long">Ministerial derives from the Latin <i>minister</i> meaning "servant." A religious minister is a servant of God. A government minister is the head of a department, but also a servant of the government. Their work is their <i>ministry</i>, thus ministerial means pertaining to that work. If, as England's minister of defense, you streamlined the military, that streamlining would be your ministerial legacy.</p></div></div>`;
