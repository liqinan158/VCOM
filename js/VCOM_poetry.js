Without those elements we have the poetic form known as “free verse,” but it retains an elevated language that still makes it <i>poetry</i>.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>poetry</i> goes all the way back to the Latin <i>poesis</i>, meaning both "poetry" and "making." It usually refers to the specific genre of poetic works, a wide variety of styles tied together by the structured use of the language, but is also used to describe any especially beautiful language. The French writer Voltaire once said, “<i>Poetry</i> is the music of the soul, and, above all, of great and feeling souls.”</p></div>`;
