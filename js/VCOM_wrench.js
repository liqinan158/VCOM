See this teddy bear? If you want it, you’ll have to <i>wrench</i> it out of my hands, because I’m not willing to give it up.</p><p class="long">Maybe you have a wrench at home, that is, a hand tool that is used to hold or twist a nut or a pipe joint. If so, you also have a great way to remember what <i>wrench</i> the verb means. Just imagine you're  twisting with a wrench, except instead of using a tool, you’re using your hands. If something is heart wrenching, it makes you feel very sad. If you wrench a part of your body, you strain, pull or twist it, injuring yourself in some way.</p></div>`;
