One <i>old wives' tale</i> you may have heard warns that if you swallow chewing gum, it will stay in your stomach for years.</p><p class="long">Bits of advice, warnings, and general community wisdom sometimes turn out to be old wives' tales. These include simple superstitions, like "don't open an umbrella indoors," and easy to believe advice like "if you shave, the hair grows back thicker" or "you'll get arthritis if you crack your knuckles." The term <i>old wives' tale</i> uses the oldest meaning of <i>wife</i>, "woman," and is actually quite derogatory. It comes from the tradition of mothers scaring their children out of unwanted behavior.</p></div>`;
