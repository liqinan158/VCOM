The feel of a soft cashmere sweater on your skin, the taste of dark chocolate, even the smell of your favorite person â€” all of these can be <i>sensuous</i> experiences.</p><p class="long"><i>Sensuous</i> describes anything that feels, tastes, smells, looks, or sounds good. Eating delicious food or relaxing in a warm bath are sensuous activities. But something intellectually satisfying, like doing a crossword puzzle or solving a math problem, is not exactly sensuous, even if you really like doing it. Use <i>sensuous</i> to describe stuff that makes your five senses happy.</p></div>`;
