Long ago, knights carried <i>escutcheons</i> into battle.</p><p class="long"><i>Escutcheon</i> comes from the Old French <i>escusson</i>, which was both a "half-crown coin" and also a "coat of arms," from a Latin root meaning "shield." An escutcheon can be an actual shield, held as defense from an opponent's sword, or the shape of a shield, especially when it's part of a coat of arms. A more modern meaning of this word is "flat metal around a keyhole," a piece of hardware with a vaguely shield-like shape.</p></div></div>`;
