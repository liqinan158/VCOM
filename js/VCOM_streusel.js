If you're not a fan of pie crust, you might prefer pies with  <i>streusel</i> on top. Yum!</p><p class="long">Typically, streusel is made with butter, flour, and sugar, sometimes with added ingredients like oats, spices, or nuts. Besides pies, sweets that often have a streusel topping include coffee cake, muffins, cakes, and fruit crisps. In German, <i>Streusel</i> means "something scattered or sprinkled," which is exactly what a baker does with streusel before baking.</p></div>`;
