If you're on a cruise with your family, you might tell your brother to meet you on the upper <i>deck</i> after lunch to play shuffleboard.</p><p class="long">Most decks are open, without a roof, and positioned high on a ship . Typically, the bridge deck houses the ship's helm and navigational tools. The deck behind your house isn't much different from a ship's deck â€” it's a flat platform too. Other kinds of decks are a pack of cards, the board part of a skateboard, and the floor: "Hit the <i>deck</i>!" To deck a person is to hit them, but to deck your house is to decorate it.</p></div>`;
