There are still some cities where you can find a <i>hansom</i> to ride in for fun, but it's no longer the fastest way to get where you're going.</p><p class="long">In the 1830s, the hansom, also called a <i>hansom cab</i>, was the latest way to get get around in busy cities. It was smaller than conventional horse-drawn carriages, which had four wheels and at least two horses. With only two wheels and a low center of gravity, hansoms were safe, light and agile, and could be pulled by just one horse. A man named Joseph Hansom patented what he dubbed the "Hansom safety cab" in 1834.</p></div>`;
