You can sometimes find tiny <i>crabs</i> in the sand on the beach.</p><p class="long">Crabs have a thick, shell-like covering called an "exoskeleton," and you can find them in both fresh and saltwater. Some types of crab are considered a delicacy, with sweet, delicate flesh often called "<i>crab</i> meat." There are many shelled sea creatures with <i>crab</i> in their names, like horseshoe crabs and hermit crabs, that aren't true crabs. The word <i>crab</i> comes from a Germanic root related to the Low German <i>krabben</i>, "to claw."</p></div>`;
