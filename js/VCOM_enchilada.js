The earliest <i>enchiladas</i> were simply a plain tortilla served with chili sauce.</p><p class="long"><i>Enchilada</i> comes from Mexican Spanish â€” it's the past participle of <i>enchilar</i>, or "season with chili." Traditional enchilada sauce is tomato-based and, appropriately, heavily seasoned with chili. You might've heard the phrases "the whole <i>enchilada</i>," which means "the entire thing;" or "the big <i>enchilada</i>," meaning "an extremely important person." Many people credit the Nixon administration's John Ehrlichman with this second term, which was famously caught on tape during the Watergate investigation.</p></div>`;
