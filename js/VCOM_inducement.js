If you're training a dog, you might use food as an <i>inducement</i> to make the dog do what you want.  This works with some humans too.</p><p class="long">The original meaning of the noun <i>inducement</i> came from the Latin verb <i>inducere</i>, meaning "to lead or persuade."  Roman philosopher Seneca said, “There is no evil that does not promise inducements. Avarice promises money; luxury, a varied assortment of pleasures; ambition, a purple robe and applause. Vices tempt you by the rewards they offer.”  So you can be seduced to bad behavior by some inducements or encouraged to good behavior by others.  Would you like a treat?</p></div>`;
