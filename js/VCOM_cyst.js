That squishy, fluid-filled mass on your calf could be a <i>cyst</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>cyst</i> entered English in the 18th century by way of the Latin word <i>cystis</i>, tracing all the way back to the Greek word <i>kustis</i>, meaning “bladder.” Like your bladder, a cyst is sort of like a small pouch, one that’s typically filled with liquid. Unlike the bladder, however, a cyst is closed, meaning the liquid can’t get out. A cyst is often an abnormal formation in the body, so doctors often remove them.</p></div></div>`;
