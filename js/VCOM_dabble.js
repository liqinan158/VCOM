Maybe you only <i>dabble</i> in mystery novels, but you are very knowledgeable about comic books.</p><p class="long">The word <i>dabble</i> can also often relate to water. It can mean “to splash playfully,” or “to get just a little wet.” A bird can also dabble in water by dipping its bill into it. Each of these meanings of <i>dabble</i> is often followed by the word <i>in</i>. For example, a duck may dabble in the water (and then dribble a few drops afterward from its bill), and you may dabble in shrubbery art.</p></div>`;
