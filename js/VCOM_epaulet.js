If you are a guard at Buckingham Palace, you have pretty nice <i>epaulets</i> on your uniform, but they aren’t as amazing as that hat.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>epaulet</i> comes from the Late Latin meaning of <i>spatula</i>, “shoulder blade.” Any fancy extras attached on the exterior shoulders of a garment can be called an epaulet. Epaulets often have gold braided embroidery. Or stars. Some have fringe. The epaulets on the uniforms of airline pilots have four rows of braids, which distinguishes them as a higher rank than co-pilots, who wear three braids.</p></div></div>`;
