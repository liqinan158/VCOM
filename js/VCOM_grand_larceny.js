If your brother takes your favorite pen, that's not <i>grand larceny</i>, but if someone steals your new car, that is <i>grand larceny</i>.</p><p class="long">In the law, the terms <i>larceny</i> and <i>grand larceny</i> are used to distinguish the crime of taking something under a certain value from something that's worth a lot more money. Where you live determines whether a theft is grand larceny or not. In New York, for example, stealing something worth more than a thousand dollars makes the crime grand larceny; in Virginia, if more than five dollars are stolen directly from a person, that's also grand larceny.</p></div></div>`;
