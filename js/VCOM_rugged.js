If you want an easy hike, you should stay away from the <i>rugged</i> coastline. That rocky shoreline is definitely for the more experienced hikers.</p><p class="long">The same sense of unevenness applies to other things that are described as <i>rugged</i>. If someone tells a man that he has a rugged face, it's meant to compliment his rough, strong looks. <i>Rugged</i> can also describe something that is steady, sturdy, and strong. Only your rugged constitution will keep you alive in that period of famine between your after school snack and dinner.</p></div>`;
