Some people still use a <i>compass</i> to navigate — usually when their GPS isn’t working.</p><p class="long"><i>Compass</i> can also refer to another type of instrument, one that’s used for drawing circles; this should be familiar to you if you have ever studied geometry. In addition, <i>compass</i> can mean "range" or "scope." If you decide to hike the Appalachian Trail, using a compass (the navigational kind) should hopefully fall within your compass of ability. If not, we hope you own a reliable GPS.</p></div>`;
