In the United States, airport security went through <i>nationalization</i> in 2001, becoming a government agency.</p><p class="long">Nationalization is often viewed negatively in countries with capitalist economic systems, seen by some as a slide toward socialism or communism, in which nationalization partly serves to redistribute money among all citizens. At various times in the US, nationalization has occurred in areas like the railway system, utility companies, and banks. The Latin root word is <i>nationem</i>, "birth, origin, breed, or tribe," and the original meaning of <i>nationalization</i> was "the act of investing with a national character."</p></div>`;
