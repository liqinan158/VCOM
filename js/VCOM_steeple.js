Many churches have <i>steeples</i>. <i>Steeples</i> are really tall so people can find the church from anywhere in town.</p><p class="long">Steeples have been around since the Middle Ages. The word itself comes from Middle English for “high tower.” A steeple on top of a church or temple makes it stand out in a crowd, and it also points right up to heaven. There’s a steeple on almost every church, but if you want to see a really big one, check out the one on the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.</p></div></div>`;
