We all hate people who <i>pry</i>, sticking their nose into our personal affairs, and it is an annoying and disrespectful habit.</p><p class="long">We are taught as children to ask questions, but sometimes those questions are used to pry, or peek into someone's private business. A nosy person will peek into some else's life the same way one might use a crowbar to pry open a crate (though — alert! — that <i>pry</i> has a different origin). Our word is thought to come from a word related to the Old English verb <i>beprīwan</i>, "to wink," which evolved into the Middle English <i>prie</i>, "to peer in," which gives us today's meaning.</p></div></div>`;
