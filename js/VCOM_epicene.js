For both men and women, it is a melding of the two into an ambiguous sexual identity.</p><p class="long">The roots of <i>epicene</i> derive from the Greek <i>epikoinos</i> meant "common to many," and later the Latin <i>epicoenus</i>, meaning "of both genders." Both lay the groundwork for the word, which refers to displaying characteristics of both genders.  T.S. Eliot once wrote, "Along the garden-wall the bees/With hairy bellies pass between/The staminate and pistillate/Blest office of the epicene," referring in this poem to the shared sexual characteristics in a single flower as epicene â€” an apt example of the word.</p></div>`;
