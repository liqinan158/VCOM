var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">repeal</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>repeal</i> something — usually a law, ordinance or public policy — is to take it back.  For example, dog lovers might want the town council to <i>repeal</i> the law that says residents can have no more than four dogs.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>repeal</i> comes from the Anglo-French word <i>repeler</i>, “to call back.” <i>Repeal</i> is almost always used in the context of law: When a government decides to get rid of an ordinance or law, that ordinance or law is repealed. That means it is no longer in effect, like if the weather becomes unseasonably hot, the schools might repeal the part of the dress code to permit students to wear shorts.</p></div>`;
