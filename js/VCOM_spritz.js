Rather than dousing yourself in cologne before your big date, you should probably just <i>spritz</i> a little on your neck.</p><p class="long"><i>Spritz</i> has roots in the German verb <i>spritzen</i>, "to squirt." You might spritz your bathroom with air freshener, spritz a pan with cooking spray, or spritz your fancy hairdo with hairspray. There are also several drinks influenced by the word <i>spritz</i>, including a <i>spritzer</i>, a bubbly carbonated drink made with wine or fruit juice.</p></div></div>`;
