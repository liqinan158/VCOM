To call someone a <i>yokel</i> is to imply that they are unsophisticated, uneducated, and probably dim-witted.</p><p class="long">Before the age of internet and television, if you grew up in a small town or on a farm, you probably wouldn’t have known about the latest fashions of Paris and Milan or the best restaurants in New York. Even now, if you live in a remote place, you may have a somewhat provincial understanding of the world. If so, when you visit the Big City an unkind “city slicker” may call you a <i>yokel</i>.</p></div>`;
