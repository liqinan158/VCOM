If you own a <i>piebald</i> horse, you could name him Spot.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>piebald</i> is a combination of <i>pie</i> and <i>bald</i>. <i>Pie</i> was the original name for <i>magpie</i>, a common European bird known for its black and white coloring. <i>Bald</i> did not mean "hairless," but referred to a white patch, especially on the head (think bald eagle). So something piebald has a combination of black and white coloring. It mostly refers to horses, although the word can be used to describe other multicolored things.</p></div></div>`;
