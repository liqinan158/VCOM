Yum.</p><p class="long">The nicest way to think of a maggot is as a baby fly â€” when maggots grow up, that's just what they become. Because <i>maggot</i> isn't a strictly scientific term, its definition can be vague, sometimes meaning "grub" and other times, "larva" in general. Maggots are usually found in a large, wriggling group, and can be harmful to farm animals with cuts or sores, as they can infest their skin.</p></div></div>`;
