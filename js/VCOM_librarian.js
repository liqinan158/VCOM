If you have a research project ahead of you, make friends with the <i>librarian</i>.</p><p class="long">There are many different types of librarians, from archivists who care for, organize, and lend very old or valuable documents; to school librarians who organize book-related projects and buy books and electronic resources that are appropriate for the students they serve. To become a librarian, you might want to get an advanced degree in library science. The Latin root of <i>librarian</i> is <i>liber</i>, "book." In the 17th century, a librarian was known as a "library-keeper."</p></div></div>`;
