A close friend or a fellow soldier — in other words, someone who comes to mind when you say, "We're in this together." <i>Comradery</i> reflects that same spirit: both words can be traced to the Spanish word <i>comarada</i>, meaning “chamber mate,” or roommate. Comradery is a feeling of trust, a bond created by a shared goal or experience — you don't have to be best friends with everyone in the group to know you have their support.</p></div></div>`;
