Fixtures tend to be the objects that are <i>fixed</i>, or securely fastened, in place. A regular patron or customer can also be called a <i>fixture</i>, like the fixtures at the local diner who never fail to show up for the early bird special. <i>Fixture</i>, modeled after <i>mixture</i>, comes from the Latin root <i>fixus</i>, "immovable, established, or settled."</p></div>`;
