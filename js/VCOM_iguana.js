If you keep an <i>iguana</i> as a pet, you'll want to feed it a lot of fresh vegetables.</p><p class="long">Iguanas look a little intimidating, since they grow as large as six feet long to the tip of the tail and have a head that resembles a dinosaur. While pet iguanas can sometimes be somewhat aggressive, they can be tamed with enough handling. The word <i>iguana</i> is Spanish, and it comes from a West Indies language, Arawak, and its word for this particular kind of lizard, <i>iwana</i>.</p></div></div>`;
