You might think of <i>nous</i> as reason or intellect.</p><p class="long">The exact definition of <i>nous</i> varies, depending on whether you're talking to a philosopher, historian, or religious thinker. In Christianity, the nous is the mind, as distinguished from the soul. You can also think of this as the distinction between thinking and feeling. Classic philosophy defines <i>nous</i> as the part of a person's mind that allows them to think rationally and understand.
