If you trip and spill the contents of your backpack on the sidewalk, a kind <i>passer-by</i> will probably stop and help you gather your things.</p><p class="long">If you witness a car accident while you're walking to school, you're a passer-by, and if you stroll past someone who's juggling flaming torches on the sidewalk, you're also a passer-by. Before the mid-sixteenth century, the now-obsolete <i>passager</i> had the same meaning. Today, <i>passer-by</i> is a fairly straightforward word ("one who passes by"); its only slightly confusing aspect being the plural form, which is <i>passers-by</i>.</p></div>`;
