If you really offended your best friend and tried every kind of apology but she refused to speak to you again, you could describe her as <i>implacable</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Implacable</i> is derived from the verb to <i>placate</i>, which means to soothe, or to appease. If you’re babysitting and the kid starts screaming the moment that his parents leave the house, and nothing you give him, be it a toy or ice cream, can calm him down, he might seem implacable. But try the TV. It tends to turn screaming kids into silent, happy zombies.</p></div></div>`;
