If you believe the universe wants you to be a famous singer, you can say you're <i>predestined</i> to be a star.</p><p class="long">The word <i>predestined</i> means "decided or determined in advance." It comes directly from the Latin word <i>praedestinare</i>, which means “determine beforehand." It’s a word that’s popular in religious doctrine, where there’s a lot of attention paid to what the future holds and to what people should do and why. When something is predestined, it has been determined beforehand, and there’s nothing you can do to change it.</p></div></div>`;
