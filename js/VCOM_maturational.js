In the case of fruits or vegetables, maturational development is dependent upon the proper outside stimuli, such as weather, and results in an edible product. In people, maturational growth must be physical, mental, and emotional––a physically mature person can still be an emotional child if they were lacking in emotionally maturational experience.</p></div></div>`;
