The <i>filament</i> supports the anther, which is where pollen develops.</p><p class="long">The word <i>filament</i> is from the Latin word <i>filum</i>, which means "thread." <i>Filament</i>, in fact, can be a synonym for <i>thread</i>. In an incandescent light bulb, a fine wire called a filament is heated to high temperatures in a bulb that lacks oxygen to prevent the filament from catching fire as it is heated. The filament begins to glow and gives off light. The first filaments were made from carbon, now they are usually made from tungsten because of its high melting point.</p></div>`;
