If you are under a lot of stress, the strain can trigger a <i>psychosomatic</i> condition like a stomach ulcer.</p><p class="long">Have you heard of the mind-body connection? That if you enjoy mental well-being you will also likely have good physical health â€” and vice versa? <i>Psychosomatic</i> originally used to describe the relationship between the body and the mind, and it comes from the merging of two Greek words, <i>psykhe</i>, mind, and <i>somatikos</i>, "body." A psychosomatic illness is triggered or made worse by a mental issue; the body gets worn down by things like constant worry and stress.</p></div>`;
