This verb is best known to us in the form of its participle <i>countervailing</i>, which gets far more time in the limelight as an adjective than <i>countervail</i> gets as a verb. A favorite combo these days is <i>countervailing duty</i>, a duty imposed on imports to match (or retaliate for) what a foreign government is imposing. You could say a running back was countervailed if a defensive player stops him in his tracks.</p></div></div>`;
