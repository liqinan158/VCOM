In government, a dictatorship leaves no room for input from anyone who is not the top guy or gal. The noun comes from the late 14th century Latin word, <i>dictare</i>, which means to "repeat or say often." In a dictatorship, one person keeps repeating the same command: "My way or the highway."</p></div></div>`;
