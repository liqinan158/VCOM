Most large orchestras include <i>kettledrums</i> in their percussion section.</p><p class="long">A typical set of kettledrums has four different sizes of drums, but some orchestras have eight or more. If you've ever noticed a sound like thunder in a classical piece of music, you're probably hearing the kettledrum. The word comes from the kettle-like shape of the drum's bowl, and kettledrums are also commonly called <i>timpani</i>.</p></div>`;
