Many species of <i>lynx</i> live in northern climates and use their huge paws as snowshoes.</p><p class="long">The lynx is known for its tufted ears, snowshoe paws, and lush, spotted fur. Because of this fur, lynx have been aggressively hunted by humans for centuries. Today many species of lynx are endangered, and while Canada lynx have a stable population, they are dependent on snowshoe hares, their preferred prey. Some etymologists guess that <i>lynx</i> comes from a root meaning "brightness," referring to the cat's glowing yellow eyes.</p></div>`;
