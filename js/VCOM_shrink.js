Talking about your problems with her can hopefully help you <i>shrink</i> them, or make them smaller.</p><p class="long">The word <i>shrink</i> is related to the Swedish <i>skrynka</i> meaning "to wrinkle." Think about what happens to a lone forgotten fruit at the bottom of your fridge drawer. After a while, it begins to wrinkle or shrink. Clothes washed in hot water tend to shrink, so be wary of the setting on your washing machine. The use of <i>shrink</i> as referring to therapists started as late as the 1960s â€” with the idea of a psychologist being a "head-shrinker."</p></div></div>`;
