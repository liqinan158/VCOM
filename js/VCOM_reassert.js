var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">reassert</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you state a fact or opinion confidently, and then say it again with equal force, you <i>reassert</i> it. You can also <i>reassert</i> forceful behavior, like when a teacher <i>reasserts</i> control over a rowdy classroom.</p><p class="long">You might reassert your belief that one presidential candidate is much better than another, or reassert your innocence when a question of someone stealing cookies from your grandparents' cookie jar is raised more than once. You can also reassert authority, the way a librarian does, hushing a conversation that's become too loud and boisterous again. <i>Reassert</i> adds the "again" prefix <i>re-</i> to <i>assert</i>, from the Latin <i>asserere</i>, "claim, maintain, or affirm."</p></div>`;
