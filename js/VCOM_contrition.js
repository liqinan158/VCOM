But anyone can feel general <i>contrition</i> for something they've done wrong.</p><p class="long">Contrition is a strong, powerful feeling that people get when they've done something wrong. Originally, this feeling came from having sinned and a fear of going to hell for it. But over the years, the idea of contrition has gotten broader. Anyone can feel contrition if they do something wrong, whether it's a tiny thing like littering or a huge thing like murdering. If you did wrong and feel bad about it, you're feeling contrition â€” you're <i>contrite</i>.</p></div></div>`;
