You can also think of <i>photons</i> as little bits of electromagnetic energy.</p><p class="long">Light is made up of small amounts of energy which are known as photons. You can tell how much radiation is being emitted by the number of photons â€” think of a dimmer on a light switch, with the brighter light emitting more photons. Albert Einstein was instrumental in developing the photon theory of light, although he used the term "the light quantum," rather than <i>photon</i>, which was first used in this sense around 1926.</p></div>`;
