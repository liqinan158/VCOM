If you're sewing a dress, you need to use fabric with the right sort of <i>drape</i>.</p><p class="long">You can describe the drape of a piece of velvet or cotton — and you can also use <i>drape</i> to mean "curtain." You could even say, "I just love the <i>drape</i> of those <i>drapes</i>!" When <i>drape</i> is a verb, it means "to cover loosely," as when you drape a quilt over your old sofa to hide its the rips and stains. In the 1940s and 50s, <i>drape</i> was also a slang term for a cool suit of clothes.</p></div></div>`;
