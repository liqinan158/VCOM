You might observe International Talk Like a Pirate Day by trying to speak only pirate <i>lingo</i>.</p><p class="long">Sometimes people refer to the language or dialect spoken in a place as its lingo: "I'd love to visit Paris, but I don't speak the <i>lingo</i>." You're more likely to hear <i>lingo</i> in the context of the words and phrases one group understands, but that outsiders might not, like computer lingo or English major lingo, or musician's lingo. <i>Lingo</i> shares a Latin root, <i>lingua</i>, or "tongue," with words like <i>language</i> and <i>linguist</i>.</p></div></div>`;
