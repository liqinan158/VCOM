That is, fancy and flowery language. For instance, you could use the word <i>magniloquent</i>, which come to think of it, is a <i>magniloquent</i> word itself.</p><p class="long"><i>Magniloquent</i> may remind you of the word <i>eloquent</i>, which describes a way of speaking that is articulate, persuasive, and carefully chosen. <i>Magniloquent</i> shares the Latin root <i>loqui</i>, “speak,” with <i>eloquent</i> and also describes a way of speaking. However, <i>magniloquent</i> describes speech that sounds very intelligent and important, but may in fact have little substance. Another adjective that sounds similar and conveys the same meaning is <i>grandiloquent</i>. Other synonyms include <i>bombastic</i>, <i>pompous</i>, and <i>highfalutin</i>.</p></div>`;
