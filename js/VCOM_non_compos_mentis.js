When a person is declared by a judge to be <i>non compos mentis</i>, they can't legally speak for themselves.</p><p class="long">You can use this Latin phrase to describe someone who isn't right in the head, either because they have a long-term mental illness, or simply because they're confused, injured in a way that affects their thinking, or intoxicated. It's more often used in a legal context, usually to officially label a person who isn't able to testify in court or defend themselves. <i>Non compos mentis</i> literally means "not master of one's mind."</p></div>`;
