An <i>armistice</i> isn’t permanent, but it’s usually a sign that both sides want to give peace a chance.</p><p class="long">War is exhausting, and sometimes you need an armistice to catch your breath and figure out a more peaceful way to live.  The word has two Greek roots: <i>arma</i> which means “weapons,” and <i>stitium</i> which means “stoppage.”  When you’re ready to stop using your weapons, it’s time to propose an armistice.  Although the word looks like a mouthful, it’s easy to pronounce if you remember that it’s an <i>arm</i> with two rhymes: ARM-iss-tiss.</p></div></div>`;
