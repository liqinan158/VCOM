In everyday usage, this word can also refer to expelling or excluding someone from any kind of group. The science club might <i>excommunicate</i> you if you declare that the earth is flat.</p><p class="long">If a congregant breaks an important church rule, its leaders might formally remove — or excommunicate—that person. This word comes from the Late Latin <i>excommunicare</i>, "put out of the community," or in Church Latin, "expel from communion." To excommunicate a Christian means, in part, that they can't participate in church rituals including the sacrament of communion and are no longer part of the community.</p></div></div>`;
