Dostoyevsky wrote long, complex, realistic novels that investigated social issues, especially the contrast between wealthy and poor people, and emphasized the importance of critical, intense moments in a person's life. Dostoyevskian writing also thoroughly explores the psychology of its characters â€” most famously in the interior monologues of Raskolnikov in "Crime and Punishment."</p></div>`;
