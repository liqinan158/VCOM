Many large farms grow fields of <i>corn</i> each year, for human or animals to eat, or to make corn-based products.</p><p class="long">Corn is an important crop in North America, since many animals raised for meat eat corn, not to mention the corn that people consume. In addition, products like high fructose corn syrup and ethanol fuel are made from corn. Many people also love to eat corn on the cob slathered with butter in the summer time. In many parts of the world, it's called <i>maize</i> instead of <i>corn</i>, which is an Old English word meaning "grain."</p></div></div>`;
