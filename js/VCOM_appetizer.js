You might serve your dinner guests an <i>appetizer</i> of crab-stuffed mushrooms when they first arrive for dinner.</p><p class="long">Usually, an appetizer is a small serving of food — just a few bites — meant to be eaten before an entree, and often shared by several people. You can also call an appetizer an <i>hors d'oeuvre</i>. An appetizer is meant to stimulate your appetite, making you extra hungry for your meal. This is where the word comes from, literally meaning "something to whet the appetite" or "something to appetize."</p></div></div>`;
