If you are a prosecutor, you are looking for a <i>preponderance</i> of evidence to convince the jury that the defendant is guilty.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>preponderance</i> can also mean "superiority in weight or significance." This meaning is particularly reflective of the word's Latin roots in the word <i>praeponderare</i>, which means "outweigh." The noun can also mean "superiority in influence or importance."
