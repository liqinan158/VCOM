It's kind of like an allowance, but for grownups — a college scholarship might include a <i>stipend</i> each semester for books, for example.</p><p class="long">Coming from the Latin <i>stipendium</i>, which means “tax, pay, or gift,” the noun <i>stipend</i> is defined as a regular, unchanging payment usually given as reward for services, but sometimes given as an allowance with no services or expectations attached. A summer internship that does not offer a full salary might instead include a weekly stipend that covers transportation and lunch costs. Synonyms include <i>salary</i> and <i>payment</i>.</p></div>`;
