var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">appalled</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Appalled</i> is an adjective that describes feeling shocked and disappointed. Being <i>appalled</i> happens suddenly, like when you find out your little sister has been blogging about your family, telling embarrassing stories.</p><p class="long"><i>Appalled</i> comes from the Latin word <i>pallescere</i>, meaning "to grow pale" â€” the kind of shock that drains the color from your face. When you are appalled, you don't just disapprove of what you are seeing; you are emotionally disturbed by it, like being appalled by the wasted food at a cafeteria or restaurant or the rudeness of someone who lets the door slam in your face.</p></div>`;
