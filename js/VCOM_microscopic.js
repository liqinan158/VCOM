The word is a scientific term if you literally mean "can be seen with a microscope," although people use it sometimes to mean "really small," as in the phrase "Wow, your feet are microscopic." <i>Mikros</i> means "small" in Greek, and the <i>scope</i> part of the word comes from the Greek word <i>skopein</i>, "to examine."</p></div>`;
