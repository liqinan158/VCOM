When you move at a high <i>rate</i> of speed, you go fast.  If you are a judge at a contest, you <i>rate</i> the contestants.</p><p class="long">It's interesting how one word can have different origins for different meanings. For example, the noun <i>rate</i>, referring to amounts comes from the Latin <i>rata</i>, “a fixed amount.” But the verb <i>rate</i> seems to come from the Scandinavian <i>rata</i>, "to reject."  If the person you are dating asks you to rate them against your previous partners, you might change the subject at a high rate of speed.</p></div>`;
