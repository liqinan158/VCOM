A parent can sign forms on <i>behalf</i> of children when they are young, but adult children can sign on <i>behalf</i> of their aging parents.</p><p class="long">Some people make a distinction between the meaning of the word <i>behalf</i> when paired with <i>in</i> versus <i>on</i>. <i>In behalf</i>, they argue, is used when the meaning is in the interest of someone else, but <i>on behalf</i> is used when speaking for someone. For example, a medical decision would be made <i>in behalf</i> of the patient, and you would speak <i>on behalf</i> of your family. The reality is that <i>on behalf</i> is typically used for both meanings.</p></div>`;
