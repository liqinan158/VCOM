You may have heard that oil and water are not very <i>miscible</i> substances, whereas seltzer and orange juice are <i>miscible</i> and delicious!</p><p class="long"><i>Miscible</i> is a word used by chemists to explain why some liquids mix together well, while others do not. Miscible liquids form homogeneous solutions, which is another way of saying liquids that have a uniform nature. Liquids that are not miscible will not form a new liquid; instead, they will each rest separately in a container (like oil and water). <i>Miscible</i> can also refer to solids and gases, although such use of the word is rare.</p></div>`;
