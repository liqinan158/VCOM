If you like to shop, you probably love going to all the little <i>boutiques</i> downtown.</p><p class="long"><i>Boutique</i> comes from a French word of the same spelling, which means any small shop. The word has its roots in the Greek word <i>apotheke</i>, meaning "a warehouse." The same root word also gave rise to the English word <i>apothecary</i>. The word <i>boutique</i> often has an air of exclusivity. The boutiques on Fifth Avenue in New York can be so expensive that you might feel like you can't even afford to walk in the door.</p></div>`;
