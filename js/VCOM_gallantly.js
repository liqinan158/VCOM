You can <i>gallantly</i> slay a dragon or <i>gallantly</i> offer an elderly man your seat on the bus.</p><p class="long">Think of the lyrics to the "Star Spangled Banner," which describe the “broad stripes and bright stars” that were so “<i>gallantly</i> streaming.” The flag was waving gallantly — meaning bravely and grandly — through the battle. But you don't have to be in a war to do something gallantly. You might play gallantly during the second half of the championship game to lead your team to victory.</p></div>`;
