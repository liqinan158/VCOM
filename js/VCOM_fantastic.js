So when your boss calls your suggestion of work-at-home-in-your-bathrobe-Fridays for the whole office <i>fantastic</i>, be sure you know which one he means.</p><p class="long">We get <i>fantastic</i> from the Latin <i>phantasticus</i>, meaning “imaginary.” Sometimes it’s still used that way: If you call a unicorn a <i>fantastic</i> beast, you’re not paying it a compliment; you’re saying it exists only in fairy tales. Most often, though, <i>fantastic</i> means strikingly out-of-the-ordinary. It can be complimentary ("You got an A? Fantastic!") or disparaging ("He was always foolishly unrealistic, but trying to reach the moon using a balloon tied to his bicycle was his most fantastic idea yet.").</p></div></div>`;
