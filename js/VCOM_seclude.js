A Buddhist monk might <i>seclude</i> himself in a remote place to meditate alone for several weeks.</p><p class="long">Most people use the verb <i>seclude</i> to talk about shutting themselves away from society or keeping themselves separate from others. An eccentric family might seclude itself from the neighbors, for example. The root is Latin, <i>secludere</i>, which means "shut off or confine," from <i>se</i>, "apart" and <i>cludere</i>, "to shut." Originally, <i>seclude</i> was used to mean "to enclose or confine," and by the 1620s it also meant "to keep from public view."</p></div>`;
