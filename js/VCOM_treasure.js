However, you can also <i>treasure</i> things with purely sentimental value — like your pet rock or your blankie.</p><p class="long">The English word <i>treasure</i> comes from the Old French <i>tresor</i>, both meaning "something of great worth." Still, the French <i>tresor</i> sounds so much more luxurious than the English <i>treasure</i>, and that form is the chosen name for an expensive perfume. Worth is relative, though. Going back further, we find that the Latin word for <i>treasury</i> is <i>thesaurus</i>, which is what a book of synonyms is called. Guess the ancients always understood the richness — and worth — of words.</p></div>`;
