You can also use <i>wellspring</i> to mean the plentiful source of things like good ideas or information.</p><p class="long">If someone comments that you're a wellspring of jokes, they're using the word metaphorically, to mean that jokes seem to pour out of you like water from a spigot. <i>Wellspring</i> comes from the Old English <i>welspryng</i>, which had the literal "spring" meaning. When it's used figuratively, <i>wellspring</i> implies an infinite amount of something: "My dog is a <i>wellspring</i> of affection and stinky breath."</p></div></div>`;
