If someone gives you a <i>lascivious</i> smile, they've got only one thing in mind.</p><p class="long">Latin-based <i>lascivious</i> and the Old English word <i>lust</i> both share the same Indo-European root <i>las-</i> "to be eager, wanton." The much older word <i>lust</i> originally meant "desire, pleasure" and over time developed to mean sexual desire. <i>Lascivious</i>, on the other hand, entered the English language in the early 15th century complete with the meaning "lewd, driven by sexual desire."</p></div>`;
