You'll almost always find the word <i>deploy</i> in a military context.</p><p class="long">The Latin <i>plicāre</i> means "fold." By adding <i>dis-</i> to it, to get <i>displicāre</i>, we get the idea of an "unfolding," or distributing. This is the basis of the word <i>deploy</i>, and it gives us a good mental image of the sending out, or "unfolding," of troops in a military plan. To <i>deploy</i> means more than just dispersing troops, however — there is usually a specific formation in mind, consistent with military strategies. And you can deploy nonmilitary assets, too, like accounting teams before an IRS audit.</p></div></div>`;
