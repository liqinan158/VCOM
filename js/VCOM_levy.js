The noun <i>levy</i> refers to a charge, such as a tax, fine, or other fee, that is imposed on something. The verb <i>levy</i> is used to describe the act of imposing or collecting the charge. If you need to raise money, for example, you may decide to <i>levy</i> a fine on your family every time you have to make the coffee in the morning. (Be careful though: your family may also take to the streets in protest.)</p></div>`;
