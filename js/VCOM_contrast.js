To <i>contrast</i> something is to look for differences among two or more elements, but <i>compare</i> is to do the opposite, to look for similarities. It's easy to tell the difference if you remember that <i>contrast</i> comes from the Latin root <i>contra</i>, and means "against." <i>Contrast</i> is also a noun meaning basically the same thing â€” you might notice the contrast of a dark tree against a snow-covered hill.</p></div>`;
