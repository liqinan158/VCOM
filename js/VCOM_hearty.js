A bowl of thick chili with cheese and a glass of milk is <i>hearty</i>. A spoon of water with a grape? Not so <i>hearty.</i></p><p class="long">You can't miss the "heart" in <i>hearty</i>. Words like "wholehearted" and "half-hearted" also have "heart" and are a help in remembering the adjective <i>hearty</i>. If you put your whole heart into anything from walking a dog to saying good morning to your friends, you're hearty and full of life. Something half-hearted is weak and not hearty.  A loud laugh that fills a room is very hearty; you can almost feel its fullness. If it comes from the heart and adds well-being and happiness, it's probably hearty.</p></div>`;
