You can recognize a parallelogram by its parallel opposite sides, and also by its opposite angles that are equal. Adjacent angles on a parallelogram always add up to 180 degrees. If the angles of a parallelogram are 90 degrees, then it’s straight up and down, like a square or a rectangle.</p></div></div>`;
