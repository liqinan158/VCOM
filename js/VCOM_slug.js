var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">slug</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the word <i>slug</i> to mean "bullet," "slimy, land-dwelling mollusk," or "super lazy person." If your mom finds you on the couch as often as she finds <i>slugs</i> in her garden, she'll call you a <i>slug</i> too.</p><p class="long">When it's a verb, <i>slug</i> means "hit," so you might say, "That bully's always threatening to <i>slug</i> me." As a noun, <i>slug</i> can also mean "a blow," or "a gulp." But if your little brother is barefoot outside and suddenly screams, "Yuck, I stepped on a <i>slug</i>!" he is most likely talking about the squishy invertebrate that leaves a trail of slime behind it.</p></div>`;
