If a swindler is trying to sell you fake medicine, then he is "preying on your <i>credulity</i>." This noun is associated with being naïve, gullible or innocent. It shouldn’t be confused with <i>credibility</i>, which means “believability,” although it is often misused in this way. You might hear someone say, “the farfetched plot of that movie strained <i>credulity</i>,” but what he or she really means is “believability,” or “credibility.”</p></div></div>`;
