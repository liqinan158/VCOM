During an old-fashioned gun duel, people would settle an argument by shooting at each other <i>point-blank</i>.</p><p class="long">The original meaning of <i>point-blank</i>, "close enough to hit the center of the target," definitely comes from French, although its origin is a bit of a mystery. Some think the source is <i>point blanc</i>, "white point," referring to the white circle in the middle of a target. Others believe it stems from <i>de pointe en blanc</i>, "point in empty space," used to describe a test shot fired into the air.</p></div></div>`;
