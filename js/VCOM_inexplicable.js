var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">inexplicable</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Something <i>inexplicable</i> can't be explained. It doesn't make sense. You don't want to come to the beach on the most beautiful day of the year? That's <i>inexplicable</i>!</p><p class="long"><i>Inexplicable</i> is made up of the prefix <i>in</i>, which means "not," and <i>explicable</i>, which comes from the Latin <i>explicabilis</i>, meaning "unfolded, unraveled." Do you see the double negative? If something is not unfolded, it's folded up and tangled â€” like something that doesn't make sense. Your school's decision to call a snow day is inexplicable, if there's barely a layer of snow on the ground.</p></div></div>`;
