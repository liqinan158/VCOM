Train cars that <i>derail</i> can cause the cars behind them to crash.</p><p class="long">Mistakes by engineers or flaws in the track can derail a train or trolley, sending it off the rails and sometimes injuring the passengers. You can also use the verb <i>derail</i> figuratively, to mean "hinder someone" or "divert a process from going in its intended direction." For example, terrorists might derail ongoing peace talks by blowing up a bus. The word comes from the French <i>d√©railler</i>, "go off the rails."</p></div>`;
