For example, a <i>despot</i> does not allow people to speak out against the leadership, nor really want them to have much freedom at all.</p><p class="long">The word <i>despot</i> came into English in the sixteenth century from Old French, but it traces all the way back to the Greek word <i>despotes</i>, meaning "master of a household, lord, absolute ruler." The word is often used to describe someone who abuses power and oppresses others. Obviously, it's not a nice thing to call someone, especially within earshot of the <i>despot</i> who has absolute power over you.</p></div>`;
