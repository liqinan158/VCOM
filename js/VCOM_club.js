This kind of club is a formal group â€” another type is simply a big, heavy stick, or a long metal one used for hitting a golf ball. You can even use it as a verb: "Don't <i>club</i> that snake! Just move it over to the field." The root word is the Old Norse <i>klubba</i>, or "cudgel, club."</p></div></div>`;
