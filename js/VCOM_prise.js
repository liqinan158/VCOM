If you're struggling to open an old window that's painted shut, you may need a screwdriver to prise it open. Don't mistake <i>prise</i> for its homonym <i>prize</i>, which as a verb means "to cherish or appreciate." The two words do share a root, the Latin <i>prendere</i>, "to grasp, seize, or catch."</p></div>`;
