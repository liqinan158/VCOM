var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">virulent</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>virulent</i> disease is one that's infectious, spreading, and making lots of people sick, while a <i>virulent</i> rant is just a verbal attack, causing sickness of the emotional kind. Either way, something <i>virulent</i> puts a strain on the people who get it.</p><p class="long">Two meanings come out of the roots for <i>virulent</i>: "poisonous" and "spiteful." The virus-carrying meaning of <i>virulent</i> often gets combined with <i>strain</i>, such as in a "virulent strain of the flu." Those who arenâ€™t carrying disease but are still considered virulent most likely lash out at others with a biting tone. Unleashing acid-tongued words on someone would be considered a virulent attack.</p></div>`;
