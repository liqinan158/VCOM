var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">participate</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If you take part in an activity or organization, you <i>participate</i> in it. For example, you <i>participate</i> in a conversation by listening to and talking with others, or you <i>participate</i> in a sport by joining a team and taking part in practices and games.</p><p class="long">You can use the verb <i>participate</i> to mean "be involved in" or "share in." Sometimes it is easy to figure out who participates in something — the runners in a race, the people waiting their turn to audition for a part in a play. Sometimes it isn't so obvious. If two students cause trouble but the teacher punishes the whole class, it might be that in not stopping the troublemakers, she views everyone as having participated — just being there means they were involved.</p></div></div>`;
