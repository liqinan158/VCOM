If you're an English history buff, you might mark your calendar to celebrate the <i>millennial</i> anniversary of the 11th-century Norman Conquest â€” which will occur in 2066. Save the date!</p><p class="long">It sounds like "million," but <i>millennial</i> goes back to the Latin <i>mille</i>, or "thousand." It originally meant "pertaining to a period of 1,000 years," or "pertaining to a millennium." We still use it this way, referring to the 21st century and the new millennium: "The art museum put on a millennial show in 2000." It's most commonly used for the generation of people born between the early 1980s and about 2000: "Oh, those millennials and their avocado toast."</p></div>`;
