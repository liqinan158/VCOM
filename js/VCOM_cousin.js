Depending on how many children are born into your family, you might have tons of cousins you've never even met, like your distant cousin Johnny who went wild up in Alaska. We also use <i>cousin</i> to describe a kind of family resemblance between things, like the way barbecue sauce is the cousin of ketchup.</p></div>`;
