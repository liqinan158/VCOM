If youâ€™re planning a trip to the Arctic, you should <i>equip</i> yourself with warm clothes, tents, and two-way radios.</p><p class="long">You might want to equip someone with an ice axe for ice climbing and a diving watch for underwater excursions. The ice axe or the diving watch is their equipment. <i>Equip</i> can also be used in a more figurative sense. If you are supposed to write computer programs but have never worked with a computer, you might say that you are not equipped for that. On a really bad day, it might feel like people are not equipped to deal with each other politely.</p></div></div>`;
