That's the <i>ocean</i>.</p><p class="long">Atlantic, Pacific, Indian...these are just a few of the big <i>oceans</i> of the world. If Columbus hadn't sailed the ocean blue in 14 hundred ninety-two, America would have never been discovered. Home to sharks, mermaids, sailboats, and tsunami waves, the ocean makes up most of the planet Earth. But you can use <i>ocean</i> to describe anything similarly vast and limitless, like an endless ocean of fans at a rock concert.</p></div>`;
