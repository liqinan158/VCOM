If you're interested in the way a city's density (the number of people who live in a certain area) affects its population, you might want to study <i>proxemics</i>.</p><p class="long">Cultural anthropologists and sociologists sometimes study proxemics. This branch of knowledge looks at the distances between people in a few different ways, from the area you call your own (like your bedroom or apartment) to the space between you and others on a crowded elevator. When you look at <i>proxemics</i>, you can see the overlap with <i>proximity</i> â€” both words describe nearness, and come from the Latin <i>proximus</i>, "nearest or next."</p></div></div>`;
