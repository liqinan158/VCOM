Depends on who you ask.</p><p class="long">The word <i>kosher</i>, literally meaning “clean” or “pure,” refers to food that has been ritually prepared or blessed so it can be eaten by religious Jews. It comes from the Hebrew word <i>kasher</i>, meaning "proper" or "lawful," and became common in English in the mid-19th Century.  It can be used as an adjective, for example, "kosher meat." In the mid-1920's, the word took on a more general meaning, used to refer to anything that was acceptable.</p></div>`;
