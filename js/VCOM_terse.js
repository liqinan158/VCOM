If your teacher tells you to make your writing in your essay style <i>terse</i> and to the point, he's saying use as few words as you can and be simple and clear.</p><p class="long">A <i>terse</i> reply or command may seem rude or unfriendlyâ€”but the word <i>terse</i> itself doesn't mean unfriendly or rude. Synonyms are <i>succinct</i> or <i>concise</i>, though these words have a more positive tone. The adjective <i>terse</i> is from Latin <i>tersus</i> "clean, neat," from <i>tergere</i> "to rub off, wipe, polish." Polished language is neatly concise.</p></div>`;
