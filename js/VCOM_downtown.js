You can usually take a bus, train, or subway to get around <i>downtown</i>.</p><p class="long">The widespread use of <i>downtown</i> probably started in New York City during the early 19th century. The original city hub was located at the southern tip of Manhattan, and as development proceeded northward, New Yorkers began to distinguish between downtown and uptown. In many cities today, <i>downtown</i> doesn't refer to the southern area of the city, just its heart or center.</p></div></div>`;
