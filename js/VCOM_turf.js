While you might carefully maintain your beautiful backyard turf, your dog might think of it as his turf, barking to defend it from intruders. This sense of <i>turf</i> means "range of influence," or territory. Both meanings of the word come from a Germanic root that originated in a Sanskrit word, <i>darbha</i>, "blade of grass."</p></div>`;
