And it's the same when a person is unacknowledged: she deserves to be recognized for some accomplishment or quality, but she hasn't been praised for it. A brilliant artist who isn't able to sell many paintings might be an unacknowledged genius, for example. This word comes from <i>acknowledge</i>, a combination of the Middle English <i>aknow</i>, "show one's knowledge," and <i>knowlechen</i>, "admit."</p></div>`;
