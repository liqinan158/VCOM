While a university offers many programs leading to graduate degrees beyond a bachelor's degree, a <i>college</i> is undergraduate only. So if you want to pursue becoming a lawyer, a doctor, or a college professor, chances are college is just a weigh station on your route to graduate school.</p></div>`;
