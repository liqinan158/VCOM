On a very hot, humid day, even a 5K is a <i>punishing</i> race to run.</p><p class="long">Anything that exhausts you because it's so demanding can be described with the adjective <i>punishing</i>. A punishing hike leaves you gasping and applying bandages to your blisters. A punishing argument with your family is more mentally arduous. Sometimes, punishing things weaken or debilitate: "The lack of snow had a <i>punishing</i> result for the ski industry." Rarely, <i>punishing</i> also means "leading to punishment."</p></div>`;
