It's all part of the grieving process.</p><p class="long"><i>Dejection</i> comes from the Latin <i>deicere</i> meaning "throw down." When you're in a state of dejection, your emotions are really thrown down in the dumps.  Dejection is also a fancy word for the solid excretory product your bowels release, or in other words: poop. Regardless of which definition you're using, it's safe to say that when it comes to your well-being, dejection is just not something you want to hang onto.</p></div></div>`;
