The gas company assured you that the error in your bill  was <i>inadvertent</i> and that they would fix it, but not before you blew off some steam.</p><p class="long">If you break down the adjective <i>inadvertent</i> you find the word <i>vert</i>, from the Latin <i>vertere</i>, meaning "to turn."  <i>Advertent</i> comes to mean "turning the mind to," and as the prefix <i>in-</i> means "not," <i>inadvertent</i> means “not turning the mind to,” or "not intending to." When your actions are <i>inadvertent</i> you're not paying attention to their consequences.  Remember that <i>inadvertent</i> ends with <i>-ent</i> by remembering this sentence: “We inadvertently ripped the <i>tent</i>.”</p></div>`;
