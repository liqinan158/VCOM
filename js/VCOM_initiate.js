As a verb, <i>initiate</i> means to start. As a noun, <i>initiate</i> refers to someone who has been inducted into a group.</p><p class="long"><i>Initiate</i> is tricky because you pronounce the last bit one way as a verb (i-ni-she-ate) and another when it's a noun (i-ni-she-at). If you're an initiate, you've been introduced to a field of study, an activity, a club, etc. As a verb, to <i>initiate</i> is to begin, pioneer, or broach a topic. You might say, "Let's initiate the swearing-in ceremony so our new initiates can join the Rule-Breakers' Club and still get home without missing their curfews."</p></div></div>`;
