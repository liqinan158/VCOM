When a guard removes the handcuffs from a prisoner's wrists, the prisoner is <i>unshackled</i>.</p><p class="long">This adjective comes from <i>shackle</i>, a chain used to fasten someone's wrists or ankles together, and its Germanic root meaning "link of a chain." Remove someone's shackles and you get an unshackled person. You can use this word figuratively, too: "In the summertime, I feel unshackled from the constraints of school."</p></div>`;
