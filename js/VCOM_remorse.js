It comes from the Latin roots <i>re</i>  for "again" and <i>mordere</i> "to bite." So, if you feel <i>remorse</i>, it means that your conscience is working on you, your past actions are biting you back, and making you feel very regretful. Synonyms for this word are "penitence," "rue," and "contrition." If you took a cookie from the cookie jar and ate it you can't return it; all you can feel is <i>remorse</i> for what you did!</p></div>`;
