Complain about a bad meal, and you might get kicked out. But the common <i>courtesy</i> is usually an apology from the manager and, if you're lucky, a free dinner.</p><p class="long"><i>Courtesy</i> is all about using your good manners, which is why it shares roots with the word <i>courteous</i>. Holding the door open for someone, writing a thank-you note for a gift, and letting the pregnant lady have the last seat on the bus are all courtesies that would make your parents proud. And if something is kindly presented to you free of charge, the gift-giver may say it's "courtesy of" someone special.</p></div></div>`;
