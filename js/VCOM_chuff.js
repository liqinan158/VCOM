You might <i>chuff</i> in the cold air as you jog down a frozen winter street.</p><p class="long">Anyone who huffs and puffs can be said to chuff, although the old-fashioned verb is often used to describe the sharp puffing sound made by a steam engine. You might read in a novel, "She heard the train <i>chuff</i> as it pulled out of the station into the night." The word <i>chuff</i> is imitative of the sound itself and dates from the early twentieth century. In British English, <i>chuff</i> has an entirely different meaning, "pleased or happy."</p></div>`;
