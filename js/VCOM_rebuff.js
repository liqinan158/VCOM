You might decide to <i>rebuff</i> a classmate's invitation to the dance after hearing him gossip meanly about a friend.</p><p class="long">Although the verb <i>rebuff</i> is a somewhat old fashioned one to use for social relationships, it's still common in the world of diplomacy. One country's rebuff of another might start a war, or end peace talks, or otherwise reverberate through the world of international relations. You can also use <i>rebuff</i> as a noun â€” deliberately ignoring your sister's text message is one example of a rebuff. The Italian root word, <i>ribuffo</i>, combines <i>ri</i>, expressing opposition, and <i>buffo</i>, "a puff."</p></div>`;
