The United States first adopted cloture in 1919 as a response to filibusters, which occur when a Senator speaks at great length, usually to avoid voting on a bill that he or she doesn't support. Filibusters can go on for hoursâ€”but when at least 60 Senators vote for cloture, all debate stops and a vote must occur. <i>Cloture</i> means "closure" in French.</p></div></div>`;
