If you're walking around on a brisk, cold day, hold on to your papers tightly — a <i>gust</i> of wind could sweep in and send your notes flying into the air.</p><p class="long">You've probably seen the famous image of Marilyn Monroe standing on a sidewalk with her white dress blowing in the breeze from a subway grate — that might be the most famous gust of air in popular culture. <i>Gust</i> comes from the Old Norse word <i>gustr</i>, meaning "a cold blast of wind." <i>Gust</i> also can be used to describe other things that come on with a sudden burst, like  a violent gust of rain or an unexpected gust of sadness.</p></div></div>`;
