Say you throw a baseball and it flies over your friend's head and cracks your dad's windshield. Congratulations, you've <i>damaged</i> your dad's car.</p><p class="long"><i>Damage</i> can also be a noun.  That crack in the windshield? It doesn't matter whether you 'fess up or blame your friend or a giant falling acorn.  It made the car less valuable and harder to drive, therefore it is considered damage. Another meaning of <i>damage</i> implies the damage done to your wallet when you buy something. In a restaurant, you might hear someone ask "What's the damage?" when the check comes to the table.</p></div></div>`;
