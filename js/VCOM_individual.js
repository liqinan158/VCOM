It can mean person or even personal. A team is made up of <i>individuals</i>, and each <i>individual</i> has <i>individual</i> strengths and weaknesses.</p><p class="long">Sometimes <i>individual</i> is a way of referring to a person, quasi-formally. You might elevate the phrase "This guy walks into my shop," by saying, "This individual walks into my shop." You might also hear this word when talking about things that are divided: foods designed for lunchboxes, such as potato chips or juice boxes, are often prepackaged into individual servings.</p></div></div>`;
