var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">plenty</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If you've eaten your fill at a big meal, you know by your full stomach that you have had <i>plenty</i>. In fact, if you had more than <i>plenty</i>, you might even get the feeling you've had too much!</p><p class="long">The word <i>plenty</i> usually refers to more than just enough, and this comes, via Middle French <i>plenté</i>, from the Latin word <i>plēnitās</i>, "fullness," from <i>plenus</i>, "full, complete." The meaning is apparent in the following quote by English novelist George Eliot: "I think I should have no other mortal wants, if I could always have plenty of music." May you have plenty of what you need, and some of what you want as well.</p></div>`;
