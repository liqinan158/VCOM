Even if you can’t understand Italian yet, the <i>inflection</i> in your professor’s voice should tip you off to whether she's asking a question, giving a command, or making a joke.</p><p class="long">What began in the 1500s as a noun of action spelled <i>inflexion</i> has since evolved into <i>inflection</i>, a word with grammatical connotation. <i>Inflection</i> most often refers to the pitch and tone patterns in a person’s speech: where the voice rises and falls. But <i>inflection</i> also describes a departure from a normal or straight course. When you change, or bend, the course of a soccer ball by bouncing it off another person, that’s an example of <i>inflection</i>.</p></div>`;
