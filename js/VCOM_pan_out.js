You might wonder if your cousin's business ideas will pan out or doubt that your friend's relationship with her boyfriend will pan out. The phrase <i>pan out</i> comes from prospectors whose method of extracting gold from streams was called "panning." Using a flat pan, they would swirl water and gravel, and any gold would sink to the bottom.</p></div>`;
