If you call the cops when the music gets too loud, you just might be a <i>party pooper</i> yourself!</p><p class="long">You can also call a party pooper a spoilsport or a killjoy â€” party poopers spoil other people's fun. You can take this role by leaving a gathering early, turning the music down at a party, refusing to play a game, or simply by scowling grouchily at an otherwise cheery event. This informal term has been used since about 1950, when it was first coined in the United States.</p></div></div>`;
