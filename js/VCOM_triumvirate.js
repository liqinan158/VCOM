In America's early days, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison were a <i>triumvirate</i> â€” three men whose leadership helped shape America.</p><p class="long">The prefix <i>tri</i> means "three," so it makes sense that <i>triumvirate</i> refers to a group of three. In this case, the three in question are powerful men who share authority. The word comes to us from ancient Rome, where two groups of three important men shared power over the Roman Republic. The First <i>Triumvirate</i> was made up of Julius Caesar, Pompey the Great, and Marcus Licinius Crassus, and the Second <i>Triumvirate</i> consisted of Marc Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian.</p></div>`;
