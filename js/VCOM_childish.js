A <i>childish</i> dinner guest might pout because you didn't make dessert.</p><p class="long">While the adjective <i>childish</i> is sometimes used to simply mean "like a child," it's more common to use <i>childlike</i> in this way. When your teacher comments that your chattering during class is childish behavior, she means that you're acting as juvenile as a four year old child. This negative implication has been attached to <i>childish</i> since the 15th century. The word comes from the Old English <i>cildisc</i>, "proper to a child."</p></div>`;
