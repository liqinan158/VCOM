While some people are nervous fliers, others don't mind airplanes at all — as long as there aren't any <i>sniveling</i> kids on board.</p><p class="long">If you've ever watched a young child have a tantrum in a store because their parents won't buy them something they want, you know exactly what <i>sniveling</i> means. To call someone sniveling is a real insult — you're implying that they're worse than childish. The adjective comes from <i>snivel</i>, "cry and sniffle" or "whine," from the Old English <i>snyflan</i>, "to run at the nose," from the root <i>snofl</i>, "nasal mucus."</p></div>`;
