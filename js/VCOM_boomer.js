These days, some younger people think of boomers as old and out of touch. Advertisers, however, are eager to win their attention because, on average, they have money to spend â€” and because there are so many of them. The "boom" part of the word comes from the sharp spike in U.S. birth rates after World War II ended.</p></div></div>`;
