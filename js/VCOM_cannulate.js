A common reason a doctor might <i>cannulate</i> someone is to give them I.V. fluids.</p><p class="long">If you've ever had medication administered intravenously — in other words, directly into a vein — your doctor or nurse had to cannulate you first. The extremely tiny tube used in medicine for I.V. drugs or drawing out blood or other fluid is called a <i>cannula</i>, a word that means "small reed or pipe" in Latin.</p></div>`;
