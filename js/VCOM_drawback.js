Some <i>drawbacks</i> to adopting a puppy can include lost sleep, having your sneakers gnawed on, and spending too much money at the vet.</p><p class="long">When something is mainly positive but not perfect, those imperfections are drawbacks. You might love your new job working at the library on weekends, despite the drawback of needing to get up early on Saturday mornings. And even though the drawbacks to getting that adorable puppy are very real, you'll probably be glad you did it. This noun, which was coined in the 18th century, comes from the sense of drawing (or holding) back success.</p></div>`;
