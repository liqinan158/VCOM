A dead or really weak strain of a virus is injected into your body, and your system creates antibodies specifically designed to fight that particular virus.  Once your body learns how to make those antibodies, you become immune to the virus, and it can’t make you sick.  The word comes from the Latin <i>vacca</i>, meaning “cow,” because in 1796 a doctor used “cow pox” viruses to create a vaccine to prevent smallpox.  Thank you, cows.</p></div>`;
