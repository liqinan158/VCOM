If you're <i>reticent</i> about your feelings, you like to keep them to yourself, and you're probably quiet in rowdy groups where everyone is talking over each other.</p><p class="long">The original meaning of <i>reticent</i> describes someone who doesn’t like to talk. Be careful in your context, however. <i>Reticent</i> can refer to someone who is restrained and formal, but it can also refer to someone who doesn’t want to draw attention to herself or who prefers seclusion to other people. Don’t confuse <i>reticent</i> with <i>reluctant,</i> which means unwilling.</p></div>`;
