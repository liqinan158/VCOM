It’s the opposite of a monopoly, which is where there are many buyers and one seller. In fact, a <i>monopsony</i> is sometimes called “a buyer’s monopoly.”</p><p class="long">The term <i>monopsony</i> was first used in print by economist Joan Robinson in 1933, from a combination of the Greek roots <i>mónos</i>, "single," and <i>opsōnía</i>, "purchase." A monopsony is not a healthy market because it often means a single employer (buyer) has a lot of available workers (sellers). An example of a monopsony is a mining town with only one employer, a coal company that has the power to pay workers low wages because there's no competition.</p></div></div>`;
