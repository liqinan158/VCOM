If you catch your brother with his hand literally in the cookie jar, you can say you caught him <i>red-handed</i>.</p><p class="long">A fancier way to say <i>red-handed</i> is the Latin phrase <i>in flagrante delicto</i>, or "in blazing offense." Aside from this legal term, you can also say "caught in the act." <i>Red-handed</i> comes from legal terminology too â€” specifically, a Scottish legal term that was inspired by the grisly image of a murderer who's been caught with bloody hands.</p></div>`;
