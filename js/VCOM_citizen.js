You can be a <i>citizen</i> of a city, a country, or the world. <i>Citizen</i> can mean "an inhabitant of a particular place."</p><p class="long">To be recognized as an official citizen of a town, city, or country, one typically has to meet certain requirements. In return, one gets certain rights, such as the right to vote. In other uses, a citizen may just be someone who lives in a place, such as a "<i>citizen</i> of the world." That's a nice thing to be, but it's not going to get you social security payments when you retire.</p></div></div>`;
