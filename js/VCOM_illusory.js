Tales of seeing Elvis and Big Foot eating together at McDonalds are probably based on an <i>illusory</i> experience.</p><p class="long">Although the adjective <i>illusory</i> can describe anything that's based on an illusion, it often has the negative connotation of being deliberately deceptive. Like a bogus investment scheme that seems to make money for investors: any real profits are totally illusory. Or the illusory claims that fad diets work â€” they only work while you're on the diet, and no one can survive on cabbage soup forever.</p></div>`;
