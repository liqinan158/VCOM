These can be heavy loads, duties, worries, or responsibilities. If you're overburdened with backpacks and food supplies on a trek through the desert, you may collapse from exhaustion. And if you're overburdened with math homework, you might stay up all night desperately trying to finish. Either way, it's too much for one person to handle.</p></div></div>`;
