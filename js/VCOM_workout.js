If you hope to join your school's track team, you'd better be prepared for regular <i>workouts</i>.</p><p class="long">If you do yoga, lift weights, or run with your dog, you can call each of these activities a workout. When it's a verb, workout becomes two separate words: <i>work out</i>. So you can either say "I work out three days a week" or "I usually do three workouts a week." When this noun first appeared around the turn of the 20th century, it referred specifically to a practice boxing match.</p></div>`;
