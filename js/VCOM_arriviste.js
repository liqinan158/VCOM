You might visit your hometown and feel like it's full of <i>arrivistes</i> who can pay exorbitant prices for enormous houses.</p><p class="long">When someone suddenly earns a whole lot more money than they did before, they find themselves in a new economic class. If the people who have belonged to this group for a long time (maybe they inherited their wealth from their grandparents, for example) are resentful of this person and their "new money," they might use the word <i>arriviste</i>.  An arriviste is newly arrived in this world â€” as you can see in the French root, <i>arriver</i>, "to arrive."</p></div></div>`;
