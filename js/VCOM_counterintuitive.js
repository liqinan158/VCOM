A red light for "go" and a green light for "stop" would be highly counterintuitive, for example.</p><p class="long">A classic example of the <i>intuitive/counterintuitive</i> divide can be found in computers: today they're so easy to use a toddler can handle them; early ones were so counterintuitive they remained a head-scratching mystery to all but a few techies. Writing tip: note that <i>counterintuitive</i> is one of those words that used to be commonly hyphenated (like "nonetheless" and "secondhand") but is now generally spelled as a single word.</p></div></div>`;
