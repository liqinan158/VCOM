Borrow and lose your roommate’s clothes one too many times, and you can bet you’ll be treated to a heated <i>tirade</i>.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>tirade</i> is related to the Italian word <i>tirata</i>, which means "volley." So imagine a very angry person lobbing harsh words and strings of profanity in your direction when you want to remember what <i> tirade</i> means. Although, <i>tirades</i> don't necessarily have to include bad words — any long, drawn out speech or epic declaration can be called a <i>tirade</i>.</p></div></div>`;
