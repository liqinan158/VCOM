Then you probably like <i>gore</i>: bloody, yucky, violent action.</p><p class="long"><i>Gore</i> certainly includes the bloody violence in zombie movies, but it can also refer to real-life violence, especially bloodshed and murder. If you stabbed someone with a sword, you gored them. An animal with sharp horns, like a bull, can gore a person to death. Gore is also blood that's clotting in a wound. An un-bloody, unrelated meaning of <i>gore</i> is a triangle-shaped piece of cloth used in making umbrellas, sails, and some clothes.</p></div>`;
