If you <i>select</i> the most expensive phone, it doesnâ€™t necessarily mean you will be happy with what you get.</p><p class="long">You can use <i>select</i> as an adjective as well as a verb. It means "specially chosen" or "of superior quality." For instance, you might be one of the select few who know how to really appreciate a game of Tetris, or you might want to choose a wine from a select list of Spanish reds. All of this assumes that if you select one thing, you feel that it's better than all the other choices.</p></div>`;
