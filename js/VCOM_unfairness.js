A teacher giving good grades to his favorite students is one example of <i>unfairness</i>.</p><p class="long">When someone doesn't have to follow the rules, that's unfairness. You might accuse your parents of unfairness if they give your brother a larger allowance even though you do more chores. Unfairness can also be called <i>injustice</i> or <i>inequality</i>. This noun once had a completely different meaning, "ugliness," because <i>fair</i> can also mean beautiful.</p></div></div>`;
