Those kinds of people have the power to <i>mesmerize</i>, holding your attention like you’re under hypnosis.</p><p class="long">The word <i>mesmerize</i> comes from the last name of 18th century German physician Franz Mesmer, who believed that all people and objects are pulled together by a strong magnetic force, later called <i>mesmerism</i>.  If you ever start to feel mesmerized, maybe it’s because you find someone fascinating, or maybe you’ve been hypnotized by a magician.  Hard to tell from here.</p></div>`;
