A man might love his classic cars but would be happy to bequeath them to his grandchildren when he writes out his last will and testament.</p><p class="long"><i>Bequeath</i> often is used about making plans to give away property and possessions after a person's death: "It was strange to leave a house to a one-year-old baby, but he planned what he would <i>bequeath</i> in his will while he was young, and the baby would be 23 when he finally did die." Sometimes <i>bequeath</i> is used for things handed down without death, as when living parents and grandparents pass, or bequeath, a legacy of stories or family traits and talents as an inheritance.</p></div></div>`;
