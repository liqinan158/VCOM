Now it is more often used of an artist's or writer's depictions ("Shakespeare's <i>imagery</i> shows a wide knowledge of the world") or of the pictures of the world in someone's mind. Think of <i>imagery</i> as being the stockpile of your <i>imagination</i>. If the imagery in your dreams is a little scary, it might be time to stop eating those spicy meatball sandwiches right before bedtime.</p></div>`;
