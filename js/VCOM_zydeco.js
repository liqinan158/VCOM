It was invented to be dance and party music, incorporating energetic rhythms and portable instruments including fiddles and washboards as well as accordions. One guess about the etymology of <i>zydeco</i> attributes it to the Creole French phrase <i>les haricots ne sont pas salés</i>, literally "the snap beans aren't salty," and figuratively "times are hard."</p></div></div>`;
