It also refers to the meaning of something. A certain date might have <i>significance</i> because it's your birthday or the anniversary of Princess Di's wedding.</p><p class="long"><i>Significance</i> starts with the word <i>sign</i> for a reason. An item's significance is a sign of its importance. The significance of something can be implicit or explicit — meaning it can be clear or only known with a deeper understanding of the situation. Your perfect score on the Calculus exam might have added significance for people who know that you never even opened your textbook to study.</p></div></div>`;
