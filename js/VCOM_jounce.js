You may love to jounce down a frozen hill on an old plastic sled, while your best friend prefers the relative comfort of a huge, inflatable tube. <i>Jounce</i> is also a noun: "That last jounce knocked my teeth together." This word is probably a combination of <i>bounce</i> and <i>jump</i> or <i>jolt</i>, and we've been using it since the mid-15th century.</p></div>`;
