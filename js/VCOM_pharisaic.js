Another way to say it is "holier-than-thou." Pharisaic people tend to talk a lot about how devout and religious they are, but their actions don't quite measure up to their words. The word <i>pharisaic</i> has its roots in the Greek <i>Pharisaios</i>, which in turn comes from an Aramaic word, <i>perishayya</i>, or "separate." In the history of Judaism, the Pharisees were an important school of religious thought.</p></div></div>`;
