This is usually an unwelcome kindness, as it comes with complete control and a lot of condescending statements like "it's for your own good."</p><p class="long">The root word "paternal," meaning "like a father," is the clue to the word <i>paternalism</i>. The <i>ism</i> suffix turns the word into a noun.  If you conquer a country and then look down on people for not speaking your language, then decide to stick around and help them out by making them do all the work while you make a lot of money, that would be one version of <i>paternalism</i>.</p></div></div>`;
