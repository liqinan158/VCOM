Any place that is a testing ground for new ideas is a laboratory, like a class full of people thinking up new ways to make paper airplanes.  The Latin verb <i>laborare</i> means “to labor,” so remember that a laboratory is a place of hard work: you can’t spell <i>laboratory</i> without <i>labor</i> in it.</p></div></div>`;
