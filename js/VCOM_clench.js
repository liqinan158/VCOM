You might <i>clench</i> your fists when you're angry or <i>clench</i> your teeth when you're worried, for example.</p><p class="long">People often clench parts of their own bodies, but they can also clench other things. Your grandmother might tend to clench you in her arms when you visit her, and a toddler might clench his stuffed animal to his chest when he falls asleep at night. The Old English root of <i>clench</i> is <i>beclencan</i>, which means "to hold fast or make cling," and it has the same origins as the word <i>cling</i>.</p></div></div>`;
