If you don't have enough money to rent a proper room, you might be able to rent a <i>garret</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Garret</i> comes from the old French word <i>guerite</i>, which means "watchtower" or "sentry box." These days, a garret has nothing to do with war; it simply means the little room at the very top of a building, which is also called an attic. The idea of living in a garret is romantically associated with being a starving artist â€” great if you don't mind hunger and stooping over all the time because the roof is so low.</p></div></div>`;
