If you’re traveling in Norway you might be amazed by the rocky cliffs surrounding the deep water of a <i>fjord</i>.</p><p class="long">A fjord is formed when a slow moving glacier carves out a valley in the earth that then becomes flooded by ocean water. Tall cliffs surrounding a narrow band of water make fjords look very dramatic. Fjords are common in countries like Norway, Iceland, and Greenland. The word <i>fjord</i> gets its looks from its Norwegian origins. Pronounce this funny looking word with a long “e” sound and the accent on the first syllable: “FEE-ord.”</p></div></div>`;
