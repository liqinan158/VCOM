That's a <i>gavel</i>.</p><p class="long">Judges aren't the only ones who use gavels. They are common in governments large and small, where they are used to bring order to the often unruly rooms where government happens. But they are also a sign of who's in charge. The practice of turning control from one party, or one person, to another, is done by "passing the <i>gavel</i>." It's a big deal when the outgoing Speaker of the House of Representatives turns over the gavel  to the incoming Speaker. Sometimes it looks like the hand-off won't happen â€” a gavel being the ultimate sign of authority and power.</p></div></div>`;
