You might be a <i>critic</i> of your school’s new plan to start the school day at 6:30 a.m.</p><p class="long">The word <i>critic</i> came into English by way of Latin, tracing back to the Greek word <i>krinein</i>, meaning “judge, decide.” If you’re a critic, you’re essentially judging something — and finding it lacking. <i>Critic</i> can be used broadly to describe any person expressing an unfavorable view, but there are professional critics as well, such as people who review movies or music. In that sense, the word describes someone who thoughtfully assesses something, either favorably or negatively.</p></div>`;
