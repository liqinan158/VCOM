Well, they're acting ostentatiously and being <i>ostentatious</i>. That kind of behavior is usually considered obnoxious and pretentious, unless you're a king who has to wear gilded robes or a rock star who has to, well, behave like a rock star. Acting ostentatiously onstage might be necessary. But offstage, they're probably just attention hogs.</p></div></div>`;
