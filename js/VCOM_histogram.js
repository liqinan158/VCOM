If you use the word <i>histogram</i> to describe a chart that uses bars or rectangles to display how often something happens, your math teacher will be impressed.</p><p class="long">The benefit of a histogram is that instead of a list of numbers, you can see information graphed on a bar chart, which makes it much more easy to understand. The word comes from the Greek root <i>histos</i> which means both "the mast of a ship" and "anything set upright," like the bars on a histogram.</p></div>`;
