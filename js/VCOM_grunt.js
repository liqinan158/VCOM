A <i>grunt</i> is a short, deep sound.</p><p class="long">If you think about the noise a pig makes, you'll have a good idea of what a grunt sounds like. It's an animal-like sound that people make when they're inarticulate, angry, sullen, or lazy â€” or sometimes if they're hurt or afraid. Pigs and other animals grunt too, no matter what their moods may be. The Old English root word, <i>grunnettan</i>, most likely came from the sound of a grunt.</p></div></div>`;
