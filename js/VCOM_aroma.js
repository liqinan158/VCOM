Unlike its foul-smelling cousin the odor, an <i>aroma</i> smells but never stinks.</p><p class="long">Want to know what aromas smell like?  Brew a fresh pot of coffee, grill some onions, and fry up a few strips of bacon. Aromas make you drool. You can also use the word to describe things that don't literally smell, yet somehow seem to linger smell-like in the air, like the oppressive <i>aroma</i> of a brutal dictatorship.</p></div>`;
