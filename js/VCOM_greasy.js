Things that look oily, like your brother's unwashed hair, are also greasy. Both <i>grease</i> and <i>greasy</i> come from a Latin root meaning "fat." A "greasy spoon" is a small, inexpensive restaurant or diner, named for the fact that many foods in such a place tend to be fried in oil or other fats.</p></div>`;
