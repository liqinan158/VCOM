If your parents always seem to let your little sister off the hook while you get grounded, you could accuse them of <i>partiality</i> in their parenting. They favor your sister over you.</p><p class="long"><i>Partiality</i> is like bias. It means that your favorite person, type of food, or way of operating tends to get priority when you’re making up your mind. A synonym for <i>partiality</i> is favoritism. For this reason, anyone who’s not directly benefiting from your <i>partiality</i> will not appreciate it. It’s unfair!</p></div>`;
