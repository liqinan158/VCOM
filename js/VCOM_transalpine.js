It assumes that you are looking north from Italy, toward the mountain range known as the Alps, and that you're talking about something on the far side of them. The prefix <i>trans</i>, "across" in Latin, along with <i>alpine</i>, which means "of the Alps," gives us the meaning "across the Alps."</p></div>`;
