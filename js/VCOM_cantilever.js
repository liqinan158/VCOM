Engineers construct bridges using cantilevers, balancing them with counterweights or reinforcing them with girders and trusses. Cantilever bridges were originally called <i>cantlapper</i> bridgesâ€”from <i>cant</i>, or "slope," eventually combined with <i>lever</i>, from the Latin <i>levare</i>, "to raise."</p></div></div>`;
