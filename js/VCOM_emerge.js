You might hope to <i>emerge</i> from an epic perming session looking like a beauty queen, but chances are it will just look like you got electrocuted.</p><p class="long">From the Latin <i>emergere</i>, meaning to “rise out or up, bring forth, bring to light,” <i>emerge</i> is an intransitive verb that might bring to mind the image of a whale rising up from the depths of the sea, or of a person popping out from a dark corner to spook you. <i>Appear</i> and <i>peep</i> are synonyms, while <i>dip</i> and <i>sink</i> are antonyms.</p></div>`;
