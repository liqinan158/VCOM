Your little sister's idea of dropping out of elementary school and starting a full-time lemonade stand might seem <i>laughable</i> to you.</p><p class="long">Your friend's preposterous plan to live in a tree all summer is laughable, and a politician's proposal to build a wall around the entire country to keep immigrants out is laughable too. You can also use this adjective to simply mean "funny," or "provoking laughter." <i>Laughable</i> comes from <i>laugh</i>, which has an Old English root and was originally pronounced with a hard <i>g</i> sound. The pronunciation changed, but the spelling stayed the same.</p></div></div>`;
