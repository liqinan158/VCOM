It's like playtime for grown-ups.</p><p class="long"><i>Leisure</i> is time away from commitments like work or school.  <i>Leisure</i> activities might include windsailing, golfing, crocheting a portrait of Betsy Ross, staring at one's navel, whatever. It's the freedom to do what the heck you want. It's not time for punching the clock or writing a paper on the role of matchsticks in the Industrial Revolution; it's kick-your-shoes-off time. If you read a book at your <i>leisure</i>, there's no rush. <i>Leisure</i> is more rare for some than others. "The billionaire was a woman of <i>leisure</i>," but <i>leisure</i> time is a luxury for most.</p></div>`;
