If you're redecorating your bedroom, you might want to start with a <i>concept</i>, such as "flower garden," or, if that's too femme, "black hole in outer space."</p><p class="long">It's a general idea about a thing or group of things, derived from specific instances or occurrences. It often applies to a theoretical idea in science: Einstein's contribution to the <i>concept</i> of relativity. <i>Concept</i> was borrowed from Late Latin <i>conceptus</i>, from Latin <i>concipere</i> "to take in, conceive, receive." A <i>concept</i> is an idea <i>conceived</i> in the mind. The original meaning of the verb <i>conceive</i> was to take sperm into the womb, and by a later extension of meaning, to take an idea into the mind.</p></div>`;
