The captain navigates the ship from the <i>wheelhouse</i>. On land, though, something in your <i>wheelhouse</i> is in your area of expertise.</p><p class="long">The term <i>wheelhouse</i> was first used in the mid-1800s to describe the area of a steamboat that enclosed its steering wheel. You can use the word to describe the part of any boat where the captain steers, though it's more common these days to call an actual wheelhouse a <i>bridge</i> or <i>pilothouse</i>. Now, a <i>wheelhouse</i> often refers to something more general. For example, if youâ€™re an animal lover, finding homes for pets is right in your wheelhouse.</p></div></div>`;
