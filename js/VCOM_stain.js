If you <i>stain</i> your sister's favorite sweatshirt, she might be mad at youâ€”especially if you didn't ask before borrowing it.</p><p class="long">You can stain your favorite white pants when you're eating strawberries, or stain the table top you're making by painting it with a tinted liquid. The resulting stain in both cases is visible. Another kind of stain is a figurative mark or blemish, like the stain on your school records from that difficult semester when you never did your homework. <i>Stain</i> comes, via the Middle English <i>disteynen</i>, or "discolor," from the Latin <i>tingere</i>, "to color or dye."</p></div></div>`;
