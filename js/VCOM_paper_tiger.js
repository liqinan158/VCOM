This phrase comes from an old Chinese idiom, which describes a <i>paper tiger</i> as a "blustering, harmless fellow," and which was popularized when Mao Zedong was quoted in 1956 calling the United States a paper tiger. The idiom makes sense when you think of how terrifying a real tiger is — and how harmless a paper version would be.</p></div></div>`;
