In a time of need, you might <i>invoke</i> a higher power. You could <i>invoke</i> Martin Luther King when talking about equal rights. You might even <i>invoke</i> the spirit of your dead cat at a s√©ance. Just make sure you don't <i>evoke</i> (to bring on a strong emotional reaction) your dead cat; that would just be weird.</p></div></div>`;
