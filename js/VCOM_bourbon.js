This is a strong, but popular, type of liquor.</p><p class="long"><i>Bourbon</i> may be French in origin, but the whiskey bearing this name is all-American: itâ€™s named for Bourbon County, Kentucky. Bourbon isn't the kind of alcohol you can drink a pint of, like beer. Bourbon has a strong, bitter taste and it's very high in alcohol. Bourbon is made from corn, malt, and rye, and it's aged in barrels: this adds to the taste and potency. Visitors to Kentucky love to tour bourbon distilleries.</p></div>`;
