The metal plate that opens and closes and is held shut once you insert your padlock? That's a hasp! <i>Hasp</i> is a verb too, meaning "lock by securing a hasp," although it's rarely used today. The origin of this word isn't clear, but we know it's related to the Norse <i>hespa</i>, "fastening."</p></div>`;
