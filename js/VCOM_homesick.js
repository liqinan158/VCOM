Most kids get <i>homesick</i> when they first go to summer camp.</p><p class="long">Everyone feels homesick sometimes, but it's probably most common for kids to get homesick when they're on their first sleepover or visiting their grandparents, or even when they leave for college as freshmen. There is a wistful yearning included in the idea of being homesick â€” a longing to be back where you started. <i>Homesickness</i> came first, from the German <i>heimweh</i>, "home woe" or "home pain."</p></div></div>`;
