Argue all you like with an <i>intransigent</i> three-year-old.

The <i>in-</i> of <i>intransigent</i> means "not," so something or someone who is intransigent is not moving. If one political party wants to raise funds to improve schools but the other is <i>intransigent</i> on the subject of higher taxes, the debate will get nowhere.</p></div></div>`;
