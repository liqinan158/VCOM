Your <i>disorganization</i> might cause you to get bad grades in school, even if you're a brilliant writer and love math.</p><p class="long">Being organized or having a good organization system means you're neat, tidy, and disciplined about keeping track of things. The prefix <i>dis-</i> in <i>disorganization</i> makes it clear that it's the opposite of being organized — your disorganization means you're inefficient or sloppy instead. The words <i>disorganize</i> and <i>disorganization</i> were first used in English in the late 18th century, specifically in reference to the French Revolution, from the French <i>désorganiser</i>.</p></div></div>`;
