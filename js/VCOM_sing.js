You get it.</p><p class="long">Many of us sing along to the radio, sing lullabys to babies, or sing happy birthday to our friends. Sometimes voices are so loud and musical that you can use <i>sing</i> even when they're not literally singing: "She waves and <i>sings</i> out a cheerful, 'Hello!'" In poetry, to <i>sing</i> is to honor or praise, as Walt Whitman does in "Song of Myself:" "I celebrate myself and <i>sing</i> myself."</p></div></div>`;
