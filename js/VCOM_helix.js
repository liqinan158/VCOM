In math, a <i>helix</i> is defined as "a curve in three-dimensional space." If you have ever seen a spiral staircase, you can envision the shape of a <i>helix</i>.</p><p class="long">To picture the shape of a helix, imagine the coil of a spring inside a sofa, or the shape the threads of a screw make, curling in a spiral. When you hear the word <i>helix</i>, you may think of a double helix, which resembles two interconnected spirals and describes the shape of human DNA. In both Latin and Greek, <i>helix</i> means "spiral" or "spiral-shaped thing."</p></div></div>`;
