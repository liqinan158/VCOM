Teenagers often prefer seeing movies with a <i>comrade</i> or two, rather than with their parents.</p><p class="long"><i>Comrade</i> sometimes refers to a fellow soldier, and it is found in the phrase "comrade-in-arms." Movies about World War II comrades-in-arms often show them risking their lives to rescue each other. <i>Comrade</i> is also the form of address for members of the Communist party. If Joseph Stalin and Vladimir Lenin ran into other at a party, Stalin would say, "Hello, <i>Comrade</i> Lenin!" The root is the Latin <i>camera</i>, or vaulted room, and originally <i>comrade</i> meant someone who shares a room.</p></div></div>`;
