You might opt for a tiny bowl of vanilla <i>ice cream</i>, or you could go crazy with a triple-scoop of Rocky Road in a waffle cone.</p><p class="long">The invention of ice cream is attributed to ancient China, where an ice cream-like mixture of frozen milk and rice was eaten as early as 200 B.C.E. Ice cream was also eaten by early Americans, introduced from Europe by Quakers, and enjoyed by Ben Franklin and Dolley Madison, among others. Widespread use of ice cream cones began at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, and in the mid-20th century, soft serve ice cream was invented.</p></div></div>`;
