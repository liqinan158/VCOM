Zoftig women aren't skinny â€” they are pleasantly curvaceous. It's more common to spell the word <i>zaftig</i> instead of <i>zoftig</i>, but both spellings are correct and come from the Yiddish <i>zaftik</i>, or "juicy." Its root, in turn, is the Middle German <i>saft</i>, "juice."</p></div></div>`;
