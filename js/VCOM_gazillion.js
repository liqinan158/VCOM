Because of that realistic ending, this word sounds almost real, but it's just another informal way to describe quantities that are overwhelmingly large, whether they're actually too big to count or you want to exaggerate them: "I'm so popular. I have a gazillion followers on Twitter!"</p></div></div>`;
