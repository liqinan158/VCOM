In other words, it's no accident. A <i>premeditated</i> crime involves careful planning and research before it happens.</p><p class="long"><i>Premeditated</i> comes from a combination of two Latin words: <i>pre</i>, meaning "before," and <i>meditat</i>, meaning “to ponder.” If you ponder — or think about — something before you act, that makes it premeditated. If you watch a lot of TV crime dramas, you may be familiar with the term "premeditated murder." This means that the murderer didn't just lose his temper and kill someone in the moment — instead, he went after a specific person on purpose.</p></div>`;
