Something has gone from great to good, good to bad, or excellent all the way to horrible.</p><p class="long">If you know that <i>evolution</i> refers to how smaller or lesser creatures evolved into more complex beings, than you have a great clue to what <i>devolution</i> means. When devolution occurs, things have gone in a negative direction. If a rich person loses all their money, that's devolution. If a championship basketball team suddenly has a losing record, that's devolution. This word also refers to a central government delegating authority to a smaller body, such as a regional government.</p></div></div>`;
