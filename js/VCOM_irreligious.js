Atheism — not believing in any god — and agnosticism — doubting the existence of god — are seen as irreligious. You're also irreligious if you do believe in god but don't belong to a religious group or attend religious services. The <i>ir-</i> prefix, <i>not</i>, is attached to <i>religious</i>, "believing in a religion."</p></div></div>`;
