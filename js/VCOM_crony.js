It also implies the idea of <i>cronyism</i>, or unfairly giving friends jobs or promotions they're not qualified for.  <i>Crony capitalism</i> refers to doing that in an economic way, like people in government giving tax breaks to their friends. <i>Crony</i> is 17th century British student slang, from the Greek <i>khronios</i>, "long-lasting."</p></div>`;
