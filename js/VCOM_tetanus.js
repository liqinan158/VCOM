It's very serious and is usually contracted through an open wound.</p><p class="long">You've probably had a tetanus shot at some point, and that's a good thing: tetanus is a serious infection that results in spasms and seizing up of parts of your body. Muscles you normally control become uncontrollable and rigid. That's why tetanus is also called lockjaw. People have the greatest chance of getting tetanus if they have an open wound. If you stepped on a nail, you'd better check with your doctor and make sure you've had a tetanus shot.</p></div>`;
