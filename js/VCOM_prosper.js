The verb <i>prosper</i> means to do well, succeed, or thrive.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>prosper</i> commonly means to generate wealth, as in “she hopes to prosper from her new investments.” But more generally it means “grow stronger” or "flourish" — crops will prosper when they have adequate sun and water, and rescued animals can prosper in a loving home. You can also prosper from good advice or a wise decision: for example, “cheaters never prosper” is one piece of advice that might help you prosper.</p></div></div>`;
