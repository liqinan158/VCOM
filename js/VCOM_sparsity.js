You might notice the <i>sparsity</i> of hair on your grandpa's head â€” but if you're polite, you won't bring it up.</p><p class="long">You can talk about the sparsity of grass in your brown and patchy lawn, or the sparsity of customers at your mac-and-cheese food truck. Whenever there's a shortage, a lack, or a deficiency of something, it's in a state of sparsity. <i>Sparsity</i> comes from the Latin <i>sparsus</i>, the past participle of a verb meaning "to strew or scatter."</p></div></div>`;
