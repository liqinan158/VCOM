Your <i>willowy</i> friend might prefer hip-hop, but she is as lithe and elegant as a ballet dancer.</p><p class="long">When a person is willowy, they're as long, lean, and flexible as the branch of a willow tree blowing in the breeze. This adjective was first used in this way around 1790 â€” earlier, it meant "shaded or bordered by willow trees." And in the 17th century, before <i>willowy</i> was coined, the now-obsolete <i>willowish</i> was used to mean "the color of willow leaves."</p></div>`;
