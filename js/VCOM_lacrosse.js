Lacrosse players carry a long stick with a netted head for cradling the small rubber ball. In women's lacrosse, the stick must be moving back and forth to keep the ball from falling out. The game now known as lacrosse was invented by indigenous people of North America as early as AD 1100. <i>Lacrosse</i> comes from the French Canadian <i>jeu de la crosse</i>, "game of the hooked sticks."</p></div></div>`;
