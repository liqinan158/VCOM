A <i>meter</i> is also a way of organizing and counting beats in poetry or music, and in the metric system, a <i>meter</i> is roughly equal to a yard.</p><p class="long">Despite the fact that <i>meter</i> has many uses, they all relate to the same things: counting and measuring. The parking meter measures how long you've been parked, while a car's speedometer measures speed. Meters and kilometers measure distance. In music and poetry, the meter is the rhythm or beat. English poetry, such as the work of Shakespeare, uses a meter called iambic pentameter, which sounds like da DUM, da DUM, da DUM, da DUM, da DUM.</p></div></div>`;
