The <i>gutsy</i> pilot Amelia Earhart defied cultural expectations and braved dangerous situations to set many records in aviation.</p><p class="long">Beyond their courage and bravery, a gutsy person also has grit and determination, often facing several challenges at once. A gutsy athlete plays through pain, and a gutsy activist confronts challenges head-on and keeps working for the cause she believes in. Around 1800, <i>gutsy</i> meant "greedy," but by the end of the 19th century it came to be defined as "brave and plucky," from the figurative "spirits or courage" sense of <i>guts</i>.</p></div></div>`;
