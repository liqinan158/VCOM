Many <i>unrecorded</i> events in history are passed on through oral storytelling.</p><p class="long">When an event is recorded, it's filmed, described in writing, or somehow documented so that it can be referred to later. Anything unrecorded hasn't been captured in a permanent form. If your cousin's violin recital is unrecorded, that means no one took a video. The stories of people who hold little power in society have often gone unrecorded, so they're frequently left out of history books. The Latin root of <i>unrecorded</i> is <i>recordari</i>, "remember."</p></div></div>`;
