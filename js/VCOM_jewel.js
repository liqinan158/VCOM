Your grandmother might keep her <i>jewels</i> locked in a safe, to protect them from thieves.</p><p class="long">You can see large, gorgeous jewels in museums and jewelry stores. The diamond in a diamond ring is a jewel, and the rubies in a pair of sparkly red earrings are also jewels. You can also use the word to mean "person as special as a <i>jewel</i>." The Old French root is <i>jouel</i>, which may stem from <i>jocus</i>, "sport or pastime" in Latin, and "that which causes joy" in Vulgar Latin.</p></div>`;
