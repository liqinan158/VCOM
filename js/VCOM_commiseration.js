If a friend's pet dies, you will probably want to express your <i>commiseration</i>.</p><p class="long">If you are feeling commiseration for someone, they are probably going through difficult times. We feel commiseration when others suffer or feel pain and we understand that pain. We commiserate with them. The Latin root <i>com-</i> means "together with." Just as <i>communication</i> and <i>community</i> are words involving getting people together, <i>commiseration</i> is about feeling other people's pain.</p></div></div>`;
