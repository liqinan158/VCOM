The word <i>vulpine</i> describes something that is crafty like a fox.</p><p class="long">The word <i>vulpine</i> traces back to the word <i>vulpes</i>, the Latin word for “fox,” and the word can be used literally to describe something directly related to a fox. Nowadays, however, you’re more likely to hear it used to describe something that has the characteristics of a fox. Many cultures associate the fox with cunning and shrewdness, and the word <i>vulpine</i> has come to be used to describe something that has a crafty, intelligent, slightly predatory quality.</p></div></div>`;
