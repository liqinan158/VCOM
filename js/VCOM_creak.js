The old, worn floorboards in your house might <i>creak</i> as you walk down the hall.</p><p class="long">Old doors and gates creak as they open, and tree branches creak as they blow around in very heavy wind. The sound itself is also a <i>creak</i>: "The <i>creak</i> of the front door in the silent house made them jump." In the 14th century, to <i>creak</i> was to "utter a harsh cry," and soon afterward it came to mean the same noise made by an object. <i>Creak</i> is imitative â€” the word itself sounds like a creak.</p></div></div>`;
