People just know they are the finest of their kind.</p><p class="long">The word <i>cachet</i> comes from the French <i>cachet</i> meaning "seal affixed to a letter or document," and if something has cachet, it's as if it has a seal of approval from society. If you start a design company selling cachets for people to seal their letters with fancy wax, try getting some celebrities to endorse it. Then your cachets will have cachet â€” and that's fancy.</p></div>`;
