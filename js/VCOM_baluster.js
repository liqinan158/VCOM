Many <i>balusters</i> together make up a <i>balustrade</i>.</p><p class="long">The rungs in a staircase that you tap your fingers against as you descend are each called a <i>baluster</i>. Wooden balusters are made from wood that's carved with a lathe into a distinctive curved shape. The railing around a patio or terrace might be made of balusters, small decorative columns. <i>Baluster</i> comes from the Italian <i>balaustro</i>, "pillar," from <i>balausta</i>, "flower of the wild pomegranate," which has a stem with baluster-like double curves.</p></div>`;
