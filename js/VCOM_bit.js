Like drill bits, which fit on the end of a drill to change its function, the word <i>bit</i> has several uses.  Usually, it means a little piece of something, even time.   If you ask me when I'm arriving, I might say, "In a little bit."   A <i>bit</i> can also be a short theatrical entertainment, the metal piece a horse bites on, or digital information that's 1/8 the size of a byte.</p></div>`;
