An <i>autocratic</i> leader is one who rules with an iron fist; in other words — someone with the behavior of a dictator.</p><p class="long">Autocratic rulers don't tend to be popular. They use fear and control to gain total power over their people. Often, their country is left destitute as a result of their actions. The word <i>autocratic</i> is often used to describe the head of a country, but really, anyone who is a despotic leader can qualify — including the boss who threatens to fire you if you refuse to polish his shoes and work every holiday.</p></div>`;
