Why were you <i>disconsolate</i> after scoring a touchdown?  Oh...it was for the other team.</p><p class="long">In addition to meaning "inconsolable," the adjective <i>disconsolate</i> can also mean "dejected."  Most people would be disconsolate after being laid off from a job, losing a beloved pet, or missing out on tickets to see a favorite band play live. This word ultimately derives from the Latin verb <i>consolari</i>, meaning "to cheer (someone) up or offer comfort to."</p></div>`;
