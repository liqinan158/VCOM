Some people like their <i>bacon</i> cooked until it's crispy.</p><p class="long">If you're a vegetarian, you might order a BLT and say, "Hold the <i>bacon</i>, please." Bacon comes from the belly or the sides of a pig, and it's typically swirled with fat, cured or smoked, and very flavorful. The word and the food have been around since at least the early 14th century, from a Proto-Germanic root, <i>bakkon</i>, or "back meat." Since the early 1900s, "bringing home the <i>bacon</i>" has been slang for earning a living.</p></div></div>`;
