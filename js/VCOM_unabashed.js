When you're <i>unabashed</i>, you're confident and proud. You're letting it all hang out.</p><p class="long"><i>Unabashed</i> describes how good you feel about something. If you're an unabashed Red Sox fan, you're a proud Red Sox fan. If you're an unabashed patriot, you totally love your country â€” and wear clothing featuring bald eagles and the American flag. This word is the opposite of <i>abashed</i>, which means embarrassed. If you feel bad about something, then you really can't be unabashed.</p></div></div>`;
