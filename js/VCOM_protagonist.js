That's because <i>protos</i> means "first" in Greek, and <i>agonistes</i> means "competitor" or "actor." It can also mean a leading figure in a real-life situation: "Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis were the <i>protagonists</i> of the U.S. Civil War." Don't use it to mean "a supporter of an idea or cause"; the word you're looking for in that situation is <i>proponent</i>.</p></div></div>`;
