If you go to a <i>funeral</i>, wear black and try not to seem like you're having fun.</p><p class="long"><i>Funeral</i> comes from the Latin root <i>fÅ«nus</i>, for "dead body," and so a funeral is the ritual that surrounds taking care of a dead body. Depending on the dead person's beliefs, there will often be a representative of a religion there to honor them in a traditional way. Sometimes we use <i>funeral</i> for dead things other than dead people. If you just gave a really bad party, you could call it a funeral for your social life.</p></div></div>`;
