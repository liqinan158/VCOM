If you choose your new shoes based on their <i>practicality</i>, you'll probably buy a pair of sneakers, rather than knee-high boots with five inch heels.</p><p class="long">A person's practicality can also be called common sense, and an object or action's practicality has to do with how efficient or suitable it is. The practicality of doctors carefully washing their hands before surgery is clear, while the practicality of dressing your dog in a ballerina costume is less so. The root of <i>practicality</i> is <i>practical</i>, which in turn comes from the Old French word <i>practique</i>, "fit for action."</p></div></div>`;
