Which basically means it’s a birthday party.</p><p class="long">Here’s something you might not know: the word <i>jubilee</i> comes from the Hebrew word <i>yobel</i>, which means “ram’s horn trumpet.” If you’ve ever celebrated the Jewish New Year, it’s possible you've heard a ram’s horn trumpet played to mark the jubilee. In Judaism, the Jubilee Year is a year of freedom from enslavement which is celebrated every fifty years. But that horn gets played every year. What’s a jubilee without a ram’s horn trumpet?</p></div>`;
