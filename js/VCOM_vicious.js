If you spread <i>vicious</i> rumors about a person, you're telling people things that will hurt her feelings or ruin her reputation. Cut it out!</p><p class="long">If you're described as <i>vicious</i>, you're someone who does brutal things on purpose, out of ill-will towards others, like beating up defenseless puppies or poisoning the drinking water for a town. You're worse than just mean if you are vicious â€” in fact, you're evil! People (and puppies) will be wise to keep their distance. Other things, like gossip, animals, or cars from horror movies can be vicious, too.</p></div>`;
