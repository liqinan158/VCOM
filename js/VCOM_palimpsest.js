The word still carries that meaning, but ancient manuscripts are rare these days, so you’re more likely to hear <i>palimpsest</i> used to describe something that has traces of early stages showing through, like "the <i>palimpsest</i> of an urban neighborhood" — in which hints of earlier styles and designs are still evident among the new highrises.</p></div></div>`;
