var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">comatose</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Being <i>comatose</i> is being in a coma, unconscious and unable to communicate, often for long periods of time. A bad illness or unexpected accident or injury — especially to the head — can make you <i>comatose</i> and trapped inside a body that isn't working.</p><p class="long"><i>Comatose</i> comes from the Greek <i>kōma,</i> "deep sleep." When you're in a deep sleep, your body is still and you don't respond to things around you. Being <i>comatose</i> means being in that sleepy, unresponsive state and not being able to get out of it. A much less serious use of this adjective is as a description for getting really tired while doing or watching something, like when you feel comatose after a chemistry lecture — assuming chemistry's not your thing.</p></div>`;
