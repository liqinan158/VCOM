var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">poke</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>poke</i> is a jab or a sharp push, usually with something thin or pointed, like a finger, a stick, or even an elbow.</p><p class="long">The main idea behind a <i>poke</i> is a prodding action that creates a depression or hole, as when you <i>poke</i> someone in the ribs with your finger. It can also mean a quick, sharp movement, like when a turtle  <i>pokes</i> its head out of its shell. Still, the word often has a less-than-pleasant feeling to it, like something not really dangerous but still annoying. We often say a tolerable experience is "better than a <i>poke</i> in the eye with a sharp stick." It can also take on a more figurative meaning â€” when you "<i>poke</i> your nose into someone else's business," it means that you are intruding in another's private matters.</p></div></div>`;
