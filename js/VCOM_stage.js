Another kind of stage is the one that actors, singers, and puppet masters perform on. The profession of theater acting itself is in fact sometimes referred to as "the <i>stage</i>," and to put on a play is to stage it. A "<i>stage</i> whisper" is one between actors that's loud enough for the audience to hear, and a "<i>stage</i> name" is an actor's professional name.</p></div>`;
