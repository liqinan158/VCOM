In 19th-century child-rearing books, we often read about strict teachers who punish children just for squirming in their seats. These days teachers are more likely to be lenient, more understanding. If you're a big fan of discipline and punishment, however, <i>lenient</i> might mean "soft" or "indulgent."</p></div></div>`;
