When you have a chance to go back and fix the mistakes on a math test, any errors you make are <i>corrigible</i>.</p><p class="long">Use the adjective <i>corrigible</i> when you want to emphasize that something can be improved or corrected. You might argue that even a country's constitution is corrigible, or hope that your physics midterm is corrigible. A much more common word is <i>incorrigible</i>, which means hopeless or not fixable, but is most often used to describe someone's personality. The Latin <i>corrigere</i>, "to put straight or set right," is the root of both <i>corrigible</i> and <i>incorrigible</i>.</p></div></div>`;
