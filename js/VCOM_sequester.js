If your sister tells you to stay out of the way so she can cook dinner for her new boyfriend, you might <i>sequester</i> yourself in your room.</p><p class="long">Legal types may be familiar with the word <i>sequester</i> since itâ€™s often used in relation to a jury for an important trial. In that case, members of the jury are <i>sequestered</i>, meaning they aren't allowed to watch the news or read articles that could influence their judgment. However, <i>sequester</i> can describe anyone who is isolated or hidden away from others, like a pop star <i>sequestered</i> in a hotel room, protected from fans' mania below.</p></div></div>`;
