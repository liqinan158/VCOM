Then again, they could be saying that you are really good at knitting, beading, and turning old t-shirts into funky pillowcases.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>crafty</i> comes from the Old English word <i>cræftig</i>, which meant “strong” or “powerful,” but the meaning of <i>crafty</i> these days has to do with being skilled at getting what you want through manipulation or trickery. Dickens’ Artful Dodger, the con-man from <i>Oliver Twist,</i> is crafty. Handmade items, and sometimes the people who make them, can also be called crafty, like your crafty sister who always makes you unique birthday gifts.</p></div></div>`;
