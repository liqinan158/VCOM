If so, take an aspirin to <i>alleviate</i>, or relieve, your pain.</p><p class="long">The verb, <i>alleviate,</i> stems from the Latin root, <i>levis</i> "light" and is related to modern English words such as <i>elevator</i> and <i>levitate</i> â€” both words implying a lightening of one's load. <i>Alleviate</i> also has this sense of lightening a burden such as physical pain or emotional duress. You can take medicine to alleviate symptoms or do exercise to alleviate stress. Or if you want a bigger challenge: try alleviating traffic congestion or world hunger.</p></div>`;
