It's durable enough to withstand red hot metals and repeated hammer blows, but you don't want your foot to be under if it falls off the table.</p><p class="long">We most often associate anvils with metalworking (or cartoon coyotes standing in the wrong place at the wrong time), but did you know that there is also a tiny bone in the middle ear called the <i>anvil</i>? It works with other small bones to transmit vibrations that allow us to hear noises. Scientists also call this bone the <i>incus,</i> but it got the name <i>anvil</i> because of its similarity to the blacksmithâ€™s tool. They may be the same shape, but the bone weighs a few milligrams, while the tool can weigh hundreds of pounds.</p></div></div>`;
