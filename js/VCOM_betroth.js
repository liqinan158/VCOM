In the really olden days, your parents might <i>betroth</i> you to someone you barely knew and you'd be expected to marry this virtual stranger.</p><p class="long">Since arranged marriages are becoming more rare, <i>betroth</i> has taken on the more general meaning of pledging to be married. If your boyfriend says, "Want to get hitched?" and you say, "Excellent idea!" then you are betrothed. <i>Betroth</i> is from the Middle English word <i>betreuthe</i>, which itself is from the roots <i>bi-</i>, meaning "thoroughly," and <i>trowthe</i>, meaning "truth" or "pledge."</p></div>`;
