Your <i>snooty</i> grandmother might refuse to take the subway because she doesn't want to mix with regular people.</p><p class="long">Snooty people generally think they're better than everyone else, often because they have more money or believe they belong to a higher social class. A snooty college freshman might demand a single room in the very best dorm, and a snooty waiter in a fancy restaurant might make you feel like you don't belong there. <i>Snooty</i> first appeared as college slang in 1918, from the now defunct 1800's word <i>snouty</i>, which implied "looking down your nose at people."</p></div>`;
