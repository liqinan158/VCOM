When you refer to something indirectly, you point at it without mentioning it, making an innuendo. If your friend who recently stopped speaking to you glares at you across a room as she says to someone else, "I would never lie to someone I called a friend," she's making an innuendo. Without accusing you directly, she's saying she thinks you lied.</p></div>`;
