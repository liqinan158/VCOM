For some, a perfect summer afternoon involves lying <i>lazily</i> in a hammock, reading a mystery novel.</p><p class="long">If your parents tell you to hurry up so you don't miss the bus, you probably shouldn't lazily finish the last bites of your cereal. Acting lazily shows a lack of energy or motivation â€” and most of all, it's really slow. Word experts trace <i>lazily</i> and <i>lazy</i> back to the Middle Low German word <i>laisch</i>, "weak, feeble, or tired." After a long, exhausting day, you'll definitely want to flop lazily into bed.</p></div>`;
