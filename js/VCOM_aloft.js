Frisbees are aloft when they cut through the air, and your hands are aloft when you hold them high to catch a Frisbee. Some things are stationary, or set in place, and aloft, like tree houses and birds' nests. You might feel suspended in time as you catch air on your bike, aloft over the ground â€” until you hit pavement reality three seconds later.</p></div></div>`;
