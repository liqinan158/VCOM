If you hope to one day be a <i>spelunker</i>, you probably have a love of dark, damp spaces and headlamps.</p><p class="long">This word may seem to have German written all over it but it's actually Latinate: from <i>spelunk</i>, meaning "cave." The word designates an explorer of caves and is used mostly in American English, in preference to the more technical and refined <i>speleologist</i>. You can describe what a spelunker does as spelunking, or if you want to make sure you're understood, you can call it caving, or in the United Kingdom and Ireland, potholing.</p></div></div>`;
