var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">reservoir</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The word <i>reservoir</i> refers to a place where large amounts of water get stored.  It can also be used to describe great amounts of other things, such as when you refer to a trivia expert as a <i>reservoir</i> of useless knowledge.</p><p class="long">The word <i>reservoir</i> comes from the French <i>r√©servoir</i>, which further derives from the Old French <i>reserver</i>, meaning "to reserve." Knowing this, it makes sense that the meaning evolved into a place, either man-made or natural, where water is stored or "reserved," usually for distribution for drinking, irrigating, and generating power. Remembering the related word <i>reserve</i> might also help in both the spelling and pronunciation of the word, as <i>reserve</i> is spelled (and pronounced) with "er," the same as "res<i>er</i>voir."</p></div>`;
