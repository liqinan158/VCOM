Most <i>grapes</i> are either purple or green, and they make a delicious addition to a fruit salad.</p><p class="long">Though grapes naturally contain tiny seeds, many varieties of so-called "table grapes" are bred to be seedless, so you can pop one grape after another in your mouth. Dried grapes are known as raisins, and this versatile berry is used to make many other products, including jelly, juice, and wine. Experts believe the word <i>grape</i> comes from an Old French verb, <i>graper</i>, "catch with a hook" or "pick grapes off the vine."</p></div>`;
