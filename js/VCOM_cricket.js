A <i>cricket</i> might be on the <i>cricket</i> field, but it’s too little to throw the ball.</p><p class="long">Crickets have small wings and antennae, and while they don't fly, they can hop far. In some places, it's common to keep a cricket as a pet — and in other places, crickets are eaten and considered crispy delicacies. If you ever get a cricket mixed up with a grasshopper, remember that crickets are usually brown and grasshoppers are green. The root of the insect is <i>criquer</i>, "creak or crackle," and the sport comes from <i>cricke</i>, Middle Dutch for "stick."</p></div>`;
