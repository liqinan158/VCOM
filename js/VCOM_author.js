It can also refer to the person responsible for something, like the <i>author</i> of a plan to overthrow the student government.</p><p class="long"><i>Author</i> comes from the Latin word <i>auctorem,</i> meaning "founder, master, leader." Bow down to the author! Well, no need for that, just make sure the author gets credit. <i>Author</i> usually refers to a professional writer. In fact, <i>author</i> can be used interchangeably with the word <i>writer</i>. But <i>author</i> packs a little more punch â€” an author is involved in the creation of the work and generating the ideas behind it; strictly speaking, a writer could just execute the written product.</p></div></div>`;
