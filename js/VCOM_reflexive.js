You might give a <i>reflexive</i> scream of fright if a bat flies in your face.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>reflexive</i> has two very different meanings. Something that's done automatically, without thought, is reflexive. Things that refer to themselves can also be called reflexive, especially certain parts of grammar, as in this sentence: "I took extra time to prepare myself for the test." Because <i>myself</i> refers back to <i>I,</i> it's a reflexive pronoun. There's even a reflexive genre of writing, metafiction, which can be described as "fiction about fiction."</p></div>`;
