Some <i>actors</i> make films, and others are on TV.</p><p class="long">Traditionally, the noun <i>actor</i> referred to a male performer, while <i>actress</i> was used to describe a female. These days, it's become more common to use <i>actor</i> for players of any gender. You can also use the word to describe someone who participates in some action, or makes things happen in a particular area: "She was a real <i>actor</i> in the labor movement." In Latin, <i>actor</i> means both "doer" and "theatrical player."</p></div></div>`;
