However peace can be big and small, seen in entire countries or brief moments.  After a war, two countries may sign a peace treaty, agreeing to not fight anymore.  Sweden has avoided war since 1814, and enjoys the peace that the lack of conflict brings. When you feel at peace with yourself, you are content to be the person you are, flaws and everything.</p></div>`;
