There are machines that create <i>white noise</i> to help people sleep, and there are also many examples in nature, like the repetitive crashing of ocean waves.</p><p class="long">The sound of steady rain falling is a type of white noise, as is the hum of a large crowd of fans in a football stadium. If you use the whir of a fan or an air conditioner to fall asleep or sleep more soundly, that's also white noise. In physics, white noise is a signal created by several frequencies with the same intensity. The term comes from <i>white light</i>, which is created by combining different colors.</p></div></div>`;
