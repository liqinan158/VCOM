When you knit, you weave yarn with needles and end up with a pot holder or a pair of mittens. Another kind of <i>yarn</i> is a long story that's told out loud. You might, in fact, tell your friend a yarn while you crochet an afghan with yarn. The Old English root word, <i>gearn</i>, means "spun fibers," but it comes from the Proto-Indo-European <i>ghere</i>, or "intestine."</p></div>`;
