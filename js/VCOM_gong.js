In the classic game show "The Gong Show," amateur performers tried to impress judges who could end the act by banging a giant <i>gong.</i></p><p class="long">There are two types of gongs: one that makes a loud, crashing sound, and another that is actually tuned to a specific note. The crashing gong is sometimes also called a <i>tam-tam</i>. The oldest gongs were played in the early Han Dynasty in China, and gongs continue to be common in religious and secular Chinese music. <i>Gong</i>, named for the sound of a gong, comes from Malay.</p></div></div>`;
