If you have a <i>penchant</i> for pizza, you either eat it daily or wish you did.</p><p class="long"><i>Penchant</i> borrows from French, in which <i>penchant</i> literally means inclined. It goes back to the Latin <i>pendere</i>, for hanging, which is also the source of <i>pendant</i>. In both French and English, speakers have long used the idea of <i>inclination</i> metaphorically: a hillside can be inclined in one direction or another, and so can a person's thoughts. But in English, <i>penchant</i> is only for desires.</p></div></div>`;
