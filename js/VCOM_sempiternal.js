Although it's often used the same way you'd use the word "eternal," in philosophy there is a distinction between those terms. "Eternal" implies something that is infinite outside the bounds of time, like God, while <i>sempiternal</i> is a more earthbound way to talk about forever. But you should feel free to tell your annoying little brother, "Your presence in my room feels <i>sempiternal</i>."</p></div></div>`;
