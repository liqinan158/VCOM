You can talk about the physical <i>pliancy</i> of your yoga teacher, or the mental <i>pliancy</i> of a national spelling bee winner.</p><p class="long">Use <i>pliancy</i> to talk about either kind of adaptability â€” mental or physical. If you're able to adapt to different groups of people easily, adjusting your conversation to fit each situation, that's one kind of pliancy. If you've ever bent a rubbery doll into various complicated poses, that's another type of pliancy. The root of the word is the Old French <i>ploiant</i>, which means "bending and supple," but also "compliant and fickle." In the thirteenth century <i>pliant</i> even meant "turncoat" or "traitor."</p></div>`;
