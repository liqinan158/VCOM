In fact, <i>salutary</i> and <i>salute</i> do share a Latin root: <i>salus</i>, which means "good health." When you salute someone, or say "Salud!" before clinking glasses and taking a first sip, you're essentially giving your salutary wish â€” in other words, hoping a person enjoys good health.</p></div>`;
