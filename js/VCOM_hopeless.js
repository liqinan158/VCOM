If you realize there's no way you'll pass your biology class, it's a <i>hopeless</i> situation.</p><p class="long">When you're struggling to learn a new language or tackling a difficult task and feeling utterly discouraged, you can say that you're hopeless. In other words, you have no hope that things will work out the way you wish they would. A plan that's doomed to failure is also hopeless, because there's no chance that it'll be successful: "His scheme to save enough money to backpack through Europe is <i>hopeless</i>, because he still hasn't found a job."</p></div>`;
