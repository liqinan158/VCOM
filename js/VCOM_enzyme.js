For example, <i>enzymes</i> help break down larger molecules of starch, fat, and protein during digestion.</p><p class="long">The word <i>enzyme</i> was coined by a German physiologist in the late 1800s to name a digestive process that scientists had been observing. The word was later given to the actual agents discovered to spark the reactions, taken from the Greek <i>Ã©nzymos</i>, which meant "leavened." (Leavening makes bread rise.) Remember that the word <i>enzyme</i> is spelled with a <i>y</i> and not an <i>i</i>, which makes sense, since when scientists observe chemical processes, they often ask "why?"</p></div>`;
