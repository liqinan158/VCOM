There’s a good chance he’s only conducting an <i>experiment</i>, a scientific test conducted under controlled conditions.</p><p class="long">To refer to a scientific test, use the noun <i>experiment</i>. If you want to describe the work done in conducting such a test, <i>experiment</i> will do the trick as well, since it can also act as a verb, as in "scientists experiment with helium." You can also use it more generally to describe trying a new method or idea. For example, you could experiment with a new hairstyle or different routes to get to school or work.</p></div>`;
