The <i>decentralization</i> of government, for example, gives more power to the individual states, rather than concentrating it at the federal level.</p><p class="long">In business, decentralization describes a structure that distributes control among many smaller groups or locations, rather than giving that power to a single, central organization. Franchises are one example of decentralization, giving individual owners of each store the ability to make decisions. In government, decentralization is often thought of as a way to move power into the hands of individual citizens.</p></div>`;
