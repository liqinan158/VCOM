Imagine a movie villain destroying a planet with a massive laser beam and you'll have the right idea.</p><p class="long">If a gardener's goal is the eradication of every single weed in his back yard, he might start by uprooting dandelions. Fittingly, the root of <i>eradication</i> is the Latin word for "uproot," <i>ērādīcāre</i>. The eradication of anything, whether it's disease, poverty, war, or weeds, involves removing every last trace of it, right down to the roots.</p></div>`;
