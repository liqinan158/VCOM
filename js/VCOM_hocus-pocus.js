Some people believe in astrology, while others think horoscopes are nothing but <i>hocus-pocus</i>.</p><p class="long">A car salesman might use smooth-talking hocus-pocus to distract you from the fact that you're paying way too much for your new convertible, and similarly, a magician uses hocus-pocus to draw her audience's attention away from the rabbit behind her back or the card up her sleeve. The word <i>hocus-pocus</i> originally came from magic shows, in fact â€” it's fake Latin, probably copied from the Latin Mass invocation, <i>Hoc est corpus meum</i>, "this is my body."</p></div>`;
