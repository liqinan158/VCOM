A typical <i>darkroom</i> is equipped with developing chemicals, an enlarger, and a red-tinted safelight that doesn't expose black-and-white film.</p><p class="long">There are so many options for photography these days that using a darkroom is less and less common â€” digital and Polaroid-style, instant photos don't require developing. Most darkrooms are kept by photographers who work with black-and-white film. In the darkroom, the enlarger projects an image from a negative onto photographic paper, which is then immersed in a developer chemical wash and a fixer wash, and hung to dry. This results in a finished product, a photograph.</p></div>`;
