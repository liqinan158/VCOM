You could refer to the <i>potency</i> of a drug or the <i>potency</i> of a political leader.</p><p class="long"><i>Potency</i> is an official measurement in pharmacology, or the science of prescribing drugs. It's also useful for describing a person's power or authority over others. The Latin root word is <i>potentia</i>, or "power," and its origin goes all the way back to the Sanskrit word for "master or husband," <i>patih</i>. The word <i>potency</i> has historically been associated with men, but it's fine to use it to describe a woman's power too.</p></div>`;
