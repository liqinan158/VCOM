Thompson â€” it was both the name of a character, "Dr. Gonzo," and a writing style, "gonzo journalism," which gained popularity over the next decade. Gonzo journalism had an exaggerated, nonobjective style, often featuring the writer as part of the story. Thompson credited the term <i>gonzo</i> to a Boston Globe editor who claimed it was Boston slang for "bizarre."</p></div></div>`;
