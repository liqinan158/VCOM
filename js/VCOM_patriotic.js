In the 18th century, the word was formed from the word <i>patriot</i> by adding the suffix <i>-ic</i>, which turns a noun into an adjective. An example of a patriotic comment would be this one, by President Bill Clinton: "There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America."</p></div></div>`;
