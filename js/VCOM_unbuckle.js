You're going to have to <i>unbuckle</i> your seat belt before you get out of the car.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>unbuckle</i> adds the prefix <i>un-</i> (""reverse of") to <i>buckle</i>, which stems from the Latin word <i>buccula</i>, "cheek strap of a helmet." So just as you buckle your helmet before you jump on your bike, you unbuckle it once you arrive at your friend's house.</p></div>`;
