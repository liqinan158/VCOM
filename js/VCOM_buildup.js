Over the course of a winter storm, there will be a <i>buildup</i> of snow on the car that's parked in your driveway.</p><p class="long">The process of something collecting or growing is a buildup, and so is its result. As you buy more and more things with a credit card, you'll see a buildup of debt. And If you venture into your uncle's spooky attic where no one's dared to go for years, there's bound to be a buildup of dust on every surface. <i>Buildup</i> has also come to mean "increasing excitement, preparation, or publicity," like the buildup before Christmas at the mall.</p></div>`;
