You can use <i>squire</i> to describe a refined and powerful man, or as a verb meaning to escort: when the queen visited, the police chief <i>squired</i> her around town.</p><p class="long">You'll encounter squires in 19th-century English novels, and you'll need to understand who they are if you're going to get the subtle class distinctions that often drive the plots of these novels. During feudal times squires were young men who assisted knights. For their loyalty, they were given land, making them and their descendants rich and powerful. If you had land, you could live off the rent your tenant farmers paid, and youâ€™d be free to be a gentleman.</p></div>`;
