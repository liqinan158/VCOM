If you leave your split-level ranch in Ohio and move to a writers' commune in Paris for good, you've become an <i>expatriate</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Expatriate</i> can also be a verb, so that American in Paris has <i>expatriated</i>. There was a scene of <i>expatriates</i>, or <i>expats</i>, living in Paris in the roaring '20s that included writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein. The word used to mean to get kicked out of your native country â€” it's from the French word <i>expatrier</i> which means "banish." The prefix <i>ex</i> means "out of" and  the Latin <i>patria</i> "one's native country," but the word took a turn and now refers to people who left without getting shoved out.</p></div></div>`;
