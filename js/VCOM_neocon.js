Moderate conservatives tend to clash with <i>neocons</i> on issues of foreign policy.</p><p class="long">Faith in the free market is one important belief of neocons, but even more important is their support of interventionism. In other words, neocons support actively promoting democracy around the world, even if that means using military force. <i>Neocon</i> is short for <i>neoconservative</i>, which adds the <i>neo-</i>, or "new," prefix to <i>conservative</i>. The original neocons abandoned their formerly leftist ideals in the late 1960s and early 1970s.</p></div>`;
