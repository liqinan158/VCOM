var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">relent</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Being unwilling to <i>relent</i> is a good qualification for a sales person. You have to keep trying to make the sale and never give in until you've made it.</p><p class="long">The root of <i>relent</i> is the Latin <i>lentus</i>, which means "to slow down or soften." The original meaning, from the 15th century, most likely had to do with the heart â€” as in "to stop resisting love." Now, however, <i>relent</i> can have all manner of applications, but the meaning is always the same: to let up, soften, yield or give in. Often, you'll hear the adjective <i>relentless</i> used to describe someone who won't relent: "The firemen refused to relent; they banged relentlessly on the door until I woke up."</p></div>`;
