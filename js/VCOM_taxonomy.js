If you've ever seen a chart with animals divided into <i>species</i>, <i>genus</i>, and <i>family</i>, you know what scientific taxonomy is. The word comes very straightforwardly from Greek words for "arrangement" — <i>taxis</i> — and "method" — <i>nomia</i>. So any special method for arranging or organizing things can be called <i>taxonomy</i>.</p></div></div>`;
