Your hand-knit mittens will probably become <i>frayed</i> around the cuffs after many winters.</p><p class="long">If your favorite pair of jeans is frayed, it may be because you've worn them for years â€” or they could be deliberately, stylishly frayed from the minute you buy them. Things that are frayed are worn, even unraveling a bit. The earliest meaning, in fact, was "worn by rubbing," from the Middle French <i>frayer</i>, "rub against," by way of the Old French <i>froiier</i>, "rub or scrape," and the Latin root <i>fricare</i>, "to rub."</p></div></div>`;
