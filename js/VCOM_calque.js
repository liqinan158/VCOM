When you take a phrase in French, for example, and translate each word literally into English, that's a <i>calque</i>.</p><p class="long">There are many examples in English of common phrases that are calques, translated from other languages. An "Adam's apple," for example, is a calque of the French <i>pomme d'Adam</i>, and "beer garden" is a calque of the German <i>Biergarten</i>. In both cases, the English phrases came from a direct, literal translation of the original. Another term for this is a "loan translation." In French, <i>calque</i> means "copy," from <i>calquer</i>, "to trace by rubbing."</p></div>`;
