Do you hate getting sweaty or feeling tired at the end of a long day of labor? When volunteers are requested, do you slump in your seat instead of raising your hand? If so, you can call yourself shiftless. This adjective comes from a now-uncommon use of the noun <i>shift</i> as "resources." So if you don't have the get-up-and-go — or shift — to do a job, you're shiftless.</p></div>`;
