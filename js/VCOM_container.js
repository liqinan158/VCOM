You might buy nuts at the grocery store, then bring them home and put them in a container, or you could put your leftover pasta in an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator for tomorrow's lunch. The thing all containers have in common is that they <i>contain</i>, or hold, things. Both words are rooted in the Latin <i>continere</i>, "to hold together or enclose."</p></div></div>`;
