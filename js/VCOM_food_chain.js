Congratulations!</p><p class="long">A <i>food chain</i> is an arrangement of the organisms of an ecological community according to the order in which they eat each other. The entire ecological community, from large animals down to plants, insects and even algae, are fed into each other in size order. We also use <i>food chain</i> metaphorically for relationships of human power. If you were just promoted from office boy to senior consultant at your glam magazine, then you just moved up the food chain.</p></div></div>`;
