A person's <i>lechery</i> may lead to wrong and unlawful physical acts or attacks on others, or to the making and viewing of inappropriate pictures and movies.</p><p class="long">Someone described as a "pervert" might also be called a <i>lecher</i>, whose offensive behavior and actions are <i>lechery.</i> Attraction between a husband and wife would not be lechery, because it's between two people who have a desire together. Lechery is a one-sided lust that crosses the line to being inappropriate and making others feel very uncomfortable or even afraid. Bad guys or "Casanovas" in literature demonstrate <i>lechery</i> when they try to win over innocent young women with lies.</p></div></div>`;
