If you're a <i>late</i> sleeper, you make a habit of dozing long after your alarm goes off.</p><p class="long">When you're late, you're not on time. You might also be in your late twenties, which means you're at the end of that decade of your life â€” closer to 30 than to 20. If your friend calls and says, "Sorry I'm calling so <i>late</i>," she means late at night, at the very end of the day. And if you refer to someone as "the <i>late</i> Mr. Smith," it's a formal way of saying Mr. Smith is dead.</p></div></div>`;
