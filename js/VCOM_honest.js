If you're always <i>honest</i>, it means you're truthful and sincere no matter what.</p><p class="long"><i>Honest</i> comes from the Latin word <i>honestus</i>, which means "honorable or respected," and around 1300, <i>honest</i> was popularly used to mean "respectable and of neat appearance." We don't use it these days to describe the way someone dresses, but instead how truthful they are, and sometimes to emphasize how simple and straightforward something is, like "good, <i>honest</i> home-cooked food."</p></div>`;
