One of the things kindergarten teachers value is the chance to work with kids while they're still relatively <i>ingenuous</i> â€” their open, trusting natures are a joy.</p><p class="long"><i>Ingenuous</i> is roughly synonymous with <i>naive</i>, and its antonym is <i>disingenuous</i>, which means "giving a false impression of being honest and sincere." Don't confuse the word <i>ingenuous</i> with the similarly spelled <i>ingenious</i>, which means "very smart or clever." <i>Ingenuous</i> is from Latin <i>ingenuus</i> "having the qualities of people born free, noble, honest, open."</p></div>`;
