You could list all the state capitals, people's names, your favorite movies, or pretty much anything. Listing can be done numerically, alphabetically, or randomly. Also, a line or surface that leans or tilts has a list, like a sagging bookcase that's overloaded. To lean in this way is to list: the Leaning Tower of Pisa is listing.</p></div>`;
