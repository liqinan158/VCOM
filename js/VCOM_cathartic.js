Most good writers try to create work that causes you to experience a strong rush of emotion.</p><p class="long">If you've been feeling like you need a good cry, you should watch a cathartic movie like <i>Bambi</i> â€” or any film that's sure to make you weep. Things that are cathartic don't always call up tears. Things that make you scream, like a roller-coaster ride or a boxing match, are also cathartic. Whatever causes you to release a sudden flood of feelings is cathartic. Some therapies ask you to hit a pillow or break dishes, because those can be cathartic activities.</p></div></div>`;
