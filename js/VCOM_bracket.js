Sometimes dates or other numbers in a sentence are enclosed by <i>brackets</i>.</p><p class="long">When you quote someone in a piece of formal writing, you can use brackets around an ellipsis, or three dots, to show you've omitted some of the actual quote: "He exclaimed, 'What a surprise to see you here [...] looking so cheerful!'" Another kind of bracket is the L-shaped support that holds a shelf against a wall, often using screws. This is the original meaning of <i>bracket</i> â€” the punctuation mark was named for the way it resembles the carpentry support.</p></div></div>`;
