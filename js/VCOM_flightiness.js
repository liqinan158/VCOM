Your best friend's <i>flightiness</i> means it's hard to make definite plans with her â€” you can't count on her to show up on time.</p><p class="long">Flightiness is generally thought of as a negative quality, since it means you can't count on someone to be dependable or responsible. Your flightiness shows in the way you flit from one interest to another or change your mind about which movie to see or who you're going to the prom with. The adjective <i>flighty</i> meant "swift" in the 1500's, but two centuries later it came to describe a skittish horse, and finally a "fickle or frivolous" person.</p></div></div>`;
