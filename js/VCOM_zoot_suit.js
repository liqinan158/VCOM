You will definitely get attention if you wear a <i>zoot suit</i> to a school dance.</p><p class="long">Zoot suits were at the height of popularity in the 1940's, especially among fashionable Italian, Chicano, and African American men. The suits were cut with very high waists, padded shoulders, wide lapels, and details like watch chains, velvet accents, and tapered pants. Men in zoot suits often also wore fedora hats and pointed shoes. Experts' best guess about the origin of <i>zoot</i> is simply that it rhymes with <i>suit</i> and the two words sounded good together.</p></div>`;
