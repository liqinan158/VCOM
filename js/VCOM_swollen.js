If you've sprained your ankle, it's likely to be swollen and may look more like a grapefruit than the body part you know and love.</p><p class="long">When something swells up, it's swollen, and that can be anything from knees and glands to pregnant bellies. You can also use <i>swollen</i> more poetically: you can describe someone with a big ego as having a swollen head. A stormy ocean with big, angry waves is a swollen sea. And a state with out-of-control spending has a swollen budget, inflated by special projects and other expenses that thereâ€™s not enough money to pay for.</p></div></div>`;
