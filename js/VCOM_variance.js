It suggests a difference or shifting away from the expected or usual, an example being snow in July, which is a variance in the weather of the United States, even in Minnesota.</p><p class="long">When the word <i>variance</i> is used in a comparison, it is usually preceded by the word "at," as in "Her values were <i>at variance</i> with her actions," meaning the two differed. This makes sense, as the word, first seen in Middle English, comes from the Latin verb <i>variƒÅre</i>, which means "to change." If a contractor needs to go outside the standing building code, he needs to obtain a variance, which is legal permission to make a change from the norm.</p></div></div>`;
