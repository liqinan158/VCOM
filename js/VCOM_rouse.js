That gives a nice mental picture to the word, and it does fit: <i>rouse</i> means to become awake, excited, or just plain keyed up, like those birds ruffling their feathers. Consider that when first roused in the morning, many people have to shake themselves to get ready to face the day.</p></div>`;
