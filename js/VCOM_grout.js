When <i>grout</i> dries, it keeps tiles in place, and once it's sealed, it protects against moisture.</p><p class="long">An old-fashioned meaning of <i>grout</i> is "porridge or gruel," from the Old English <i>gruta</i>, "coarse meal," and a root meaning "to grind." These days you don't eat grout, but instead use it in home improvement projects, especially between floor or wall tiles. As a verb, to grout means "to apply grout."</p></div>`;
