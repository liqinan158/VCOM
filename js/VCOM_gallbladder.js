The <i>gallbladder</i> is situated just underneath the liver, on the right side of the body.</p><p class="long">Your gallbladder aids in digestion by storing the bile your liver produces and releasing it into your small intestine every time you eat food. Bile is a liquid that helps break down the fat you eat. When someone has a problem with their gallbladder (like a tendency to get painful, hardened masses called gallstones), they sometimes have surgery to remove the organ. You can live without a gallbladder, although it's harder to digest fatty food without one.</p></div></div>`;
