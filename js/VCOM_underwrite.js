An insurance agent can <i>underwrite</i> your renter's insurance policy, which protects you if there's a fire or robbery, for example.</p><p class="long">Insurance companies can underwrite, estimating the value of a life or property, and so can large banks â€” when a bank underwrites a loan, it means they carefully check the borrower's credit history. The word <i>underwrite</i> comes from the Old English <i>underwritan</i>, "write at the foot of," and originally is exactly what underwriters did, signing their names at the bottom of an assessment of risk, promising to pay in case of disaster in exchange for a set amount of money.</p></div></div>`;
