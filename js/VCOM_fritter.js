You can <i>fritter</i> money, time, or energy, but once you've "<i>frittered</i> it away," you can't get it back!</p><p class="long">The first time you get a paycheck, you might be tempted to go on a spending spree, buying fireworks, a rabbit costume, and a giant gumball machine. But be careful, because if you fritter away your hard-earned cash like that, you won’t have any left for important things, like food and rent. The Old English root of the word means “break into fragments,” which is what happens to someone who fritters their life away.</p></div></div>`;
