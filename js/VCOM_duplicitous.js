He's being <i>duplicitous</i>, or pretending to have feelings that his actions contradict.</p><p class="long">In <i>duplicitous</i>, you can see the word <i>duplicity</i>, which means "doubleness." Someone who is duplicitous is almost like two people, saying one thing but then doing something very different, even contradictory. Someone who is duplicitous can also be called "two-faced," a vivid way to remember that this person shouldn't be trusted or taken at face value.</p></div>`;
