You can revert to a simpler way of life or revert to bad behavior. Software users might revert to an older version of a program with fewer bugs. Though rare in modern use, some international English speakers do use "<i>revert</i> back" for "reply" in writing and e-mail, but most of the time, using <i>revert</i> with "back" is redundant, or repetitive.</p></div></div>`;
