Your friends might not mind because you're so humble, but it could offend other classmates when the teachers always pick you for awards and honors. You also <i>offend</i> when you cause disgust or distaste. After your week of camping — and not showering — your smell will probably offend the nose of anyone who has to sit near you.</p></div>`;
