It's possible to <i>desalinate</i> ocean water in order to make it drinkable.</p><p class="long">Scientists have figured out how to desalinate seawater, making it much more useful to humans. Once you strip away the salt and other minerals that make it undrinkable, the water can be used for both drinking and irrigating crops, which can save the lives of people experiencing droughts. It's also sometimes necessary to desalinate soil so that plants can grow in it. <i>Desalinate</i> comes from <i>de-</i>, "undo," and <i>saline</i>, "made of salt."</p></div></div>`;
