Sometimes this is done by adding chemical <i>preservatives</i>, and other times it's a more natural process, involving drying, pickling, salting, or canning. Preserved fruit, cooked with sugar and sealed in jars, is also called <i>preserves</i>. These words all stem from the Medieval Latin <i>preservare</i>, "keep safe."</p></div>`;
