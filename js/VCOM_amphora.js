Some are small like wine bottles, but others are as big as grown men. All of them have oval bodies, skinny necks, and two handles.</p><p class="long">The amphora was used in ancient Greece and Rome as a type of container for wine or oil. People don’t use them for wine or oil anymore, but you might find a decorative amphora in a fancy house, although you’d most likely see one in an ancient art exhibit at a museum. You can detect the meaning of this word in its two Greek roots, since <i>amph</i> means "on both sides" and <i>phor</i> means "to carry."</p></div></div>`;
