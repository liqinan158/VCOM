If a pirate decides that his hiding place for a treasure chest isn't secret enough, he might dig it up and <i>rebury</i> it in a more secluded spot.</p><p class="long">To <i>bury</i> something is to dig a hole, put the object in it, and cover it up with dirt. When you <i>rebury</i> something, you simply do this a subsequent time: "My dog likes to bury her bone in the yard, dig it up, and <i>rebury</i> it in the exact same place." The "again" prefix <i>re-</i> is added to <i>bury</i>, from an Old English root, <i>byrgan</i>, "to hide or bury."</p></div>`;
