Despite a baby bird's <i>ugliness</i>, it might grow up to be quite beautiful.</p><p class="long">You can talk about an unappealing appearance â€” that's one kind of ugliness. You might decide not to rent an apartment due to its ugliness, or refuse to wear a sweater your grandma knitted for you because of its ugliness. Another kind of ugliness is more figurative, like the ugliness of racism or the ugliness of a bully's actions. <i>Ugliness</i> comes from <i>ugly</i> and its Scandinavian root meaning "fear or dread."</p></div>`;
