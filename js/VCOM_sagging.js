The <i>sagging</i> ceiling in the kitchen is a clue that there's a leak in the upstairs bathroom plumbing.</p><p class="long">If you've got sagging pants, you need a belt or suspenders to hitch them up â€” or you might want to buy yourself a smaller pair! The adjective <i>sagging</i> is a good way to describe droopy trousers, but it's also useful for an old, sagging table or your sagging spirits at the end of a long, draining day at work. It comes from the verb <i>sag</i> and its Germanic root meaning "to sink."</p></div>`;
