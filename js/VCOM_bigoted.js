The Civil Rights Movement fought against the <i>bigoted</i> behavior of whites against blacks.</p><p class="long">A <i>bigoted</i> person doesn't tolerate the opinions of others, and never rethinks his position. Usually when we call someone bigoted, he is hostile to people who are different than him either by race, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation. While the "-ed" construction of the word might be a bit misleading, someone bigoted is the one expressing bigotry, not the one afflicted by it.</p></div></div>`;
