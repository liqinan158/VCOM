The words <i>hallowed</i> and <i>unhallowed</i> are used most frequently in religious speech or writing, often Catholic. A proper Catholic burial, for example, would be in hallowed ground. Both words come from the Old English <i>halgian</i>, "to make holy, consecrate, or ordain," related to <i>halig</i>, or "holy."</p></div></div>`;
