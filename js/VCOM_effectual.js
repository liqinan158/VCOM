var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">effectual</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Effectual</i> means good at achieving the results you want. The most effectual method for avoiding cavities? Brush, floss, lay off the candy, and see your dentist every 6 months.</p><p class="long">Wait, aren't <i>effectual</i> and <i>effective</i> basically the same adjectives with the same meaning? Well, generally speaking, yes. But if you want to get really nit-picky, you might note that <i>effectual</i> actually describes something that produces the desired result, but in a big way. <i>Effective</i> simply gets the job done. No one is going to call you out for using either word interchangeably though, as long as it's done effectually.</p></div>`;
