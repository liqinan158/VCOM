Some public parks have a <i>bandstand</i> for outdoor concerts.</p><p class="long">Many bandstands are shaped like a circle or semi-circle, with open sides — some are basically gazebos — and they usually have a roof. While most bandstands are outside, you might also see a bandstand in a large indoor space like a dance hall. During the Victorian era, it became common for public parks in Britain to have a bandstand, where brass bands frequently performed. The first recorded use of the word was in 1859.</p></div>`;
