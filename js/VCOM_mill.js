var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">mill</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>mill</i> is a factory or plant, especially one that's equipped for grinding grain into flour. The facility is a <i>mill</i>, and the machine that does the actual grinding is also called a <i>mill</i>.</p><p class="long">When a mill crushes and grinds grain like wheat or corn, you can say it <i>mills</i> flour. Other kinds of mills might mill powder or coffee â€” and still other mills don't actually grind anything; instead, they manufacture things like steel or paper. If someone "<i>mills</i> around," they wander or move about in a confused way: "The crowd <i>mills</i> around during the concert's intermission." This sense of <i>mill</i> was originally used to describe cattle.</p></div>`;
