It is also poetically considered to be the place where our feelings reside.</p><p class="long">Used as a verb or noun, <i>bosom</i> originates from the Old English word <i>bosm,</i> meaning "breast, womb, surface, or ship's hold." It is commonly used as a polite reference to a woman's breasts. Because our bosom (chest) contains our heart, it has also become known as the place where our feelings, intuitions, or secret thoughts are kept. Close friends are sometimes called "bosom buddies."</p></div></div>`;
