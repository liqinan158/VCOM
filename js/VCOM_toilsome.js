Shoveling a foot of heavy snow out of your neighbor's long driveway is <i>toilsome</i>.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>toilsome</i> is archaic â€” it's hardly ever used anymore. It's a shame, because it's a good way to describe monotonous or strenuous work, like your toilsome math homework or your sister's toilsome job on a construction site. At the heart of <i>toilsome</i> is the verb <i>toil</i>, or "work," from the Old French <i>toeillier</i>, "drag about or make dirty," which is probably rooted in the Latin word <i>tudiculare</i>, "crush with a small hammer."</p></div>`;
