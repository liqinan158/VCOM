When something exists in multiple forms, it's manifold, or has many kinds. Think of a multiplex theater that can show multiple movies at once. Walk through a garden full of flowers and you'll see multiple kinds of blooms. A multiple is also a number that can be divided into another number without a remainder.  Multiples of five, for example are ten, fifteen, twenty... â€” you get the picture.</p></div></div>`;
