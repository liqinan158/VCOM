If you live for an entire year on Twinkies and diet soda, you will undoubtedly suffer from <i>malnutrition</i>.</p><p class="long">When you break apart the word <i>malnutrition</i>, it’s easy to remember what it means. You’re probably already familiar with <i>nutrition</i>, which refers to taking in or using food. Add on the prefix <i>mal-</i>, meaning “bad,” and you get a word that means “bad nutrition.” If you suffer from malnutrition, that means you aren’t getting the right balance of nutrients. This can be caused by not getting enough to eat, or it can be caused by not eating enough healthy foods.</p></div></div>`;
