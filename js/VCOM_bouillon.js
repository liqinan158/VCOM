A nice cup of <i>bouillon</i> will make you feel better if you have a cold or a stomachache.</p><p class="long"><i>Bouillon</i> comes from a 17th-century French word that means "liquid in which something has been boiled." It is a common base for soups and stocks. Real cooks may turn up their noses, but if you don't have time to make your own, you can always use bouillon cubes when making soups and sauces. Don't confuse this word with <i>bullion</i>, a term for gold or silver in the form of bars or ingots.</p></div></div>`;
