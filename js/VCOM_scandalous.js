var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">scandalous</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Scandalous</i> describes something that's shocking, and maybe a little embarrassing or even offensive. Your great-grandfather might be a <i>scandalous</i> character in your family history if he was married seven times, each time to younger and younger wives.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>scandalous</i> can refer to something morally offensive, or even illegal, although it's used often simply to mean "shocking". It describes something that has potential to cause a scandal, which comes from the Greek <i>skandalon</i>, "a trap laid for an enemy." This idea of a trap or a snare is a great metaphor; you can stumble into scandal as if it's just waiting for you to make a misstep, and if you do the results will be scandalous.</p></div>`;
