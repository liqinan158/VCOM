At funerals, sometimes several people <i>eulogize</i> the deceased person.</p><p class="long">You can eulogize a living person — particularly if she has retired from a job — or even a place or a group. You might eulogize your elementary school after it's been closed, or eulogize the coach of your basketball team after she's left for a job in another town. The verb <i>eulogize</i> comes from <i>eulogy</i>, a speech that praises, from the Greek root <i>eulogia</i>, "praise" or "fine language," from <i>eu</i>, "well," and <i>-logia</i>, "speaking."</p></div>`;
