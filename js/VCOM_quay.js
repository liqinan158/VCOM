It's not an aqua parking lot. It's called a <i>quay</i>.</p><p class="long">When you visit France and take a walk beside the wharves where boats dock and unload passengers, you can say you've been strolling along the quays of the Seine. The English spelling of this word was originally <i>key</i>, and that's one way to pronounce it even today, an alternative to "qway." <i>Quay</i> comes from the Old North French <i>cai</i>, "sand bank."</p></div>`;
