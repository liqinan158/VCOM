When a movie star is known for being unassuming and friendly, you can also call them <i>down-to-earth</i>.</p><p class="long">This adjective has two slightly different meanings, the first of which is "realistic and sensible." You could say that someone who's down-to-earth has a lot of common sense. The second meaning is "modest or unpretentious," like a rock star who drives an old car and shows up at the local library and coffee shop â€” just like a regular person. Either way, being described as down-to-earth is always a compliment.</p></div></div>`;
