If you cut your knee really badly, the doctor might put a <i>tourniquet</i> on your thigh before operating â€” to control the blood flow to your knee.</p><p class="long">A tourniquet is usually used for two purposes in medicine. In surgery, a tourniquet is used to stop the flow of blood to a limb while it is being operated on. In an emergency, a tourniquet is used to control blood loss.
