A <i>crook</i> can also be a criminal — a person who’s dishonest, or bent, just like the staff.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>crook</i> entered English in the 13th century as a way to describe the long tool with a hook at one end. It later took on the meaning of “petty criminal.” You can use <i>crook</i> as an informal way to describe someone who is dishonest. A crook is typically involved in minor or nonviolent crimes; you wouldn’t use the word to describe a murderer, for example. A con man or someone committing fraud could be called a crook.</p></div>`;
