You’re right. The word <i>bicameral</i> originates from the Latin <i>bi-</i>, meaning "two," combined with <i>camera</i>, meaning "chamber." <i>Chamber</i> is just another way of referring to a legislative branch of a government or other official organization. You’re probably already familiar with one famous bicameral system: the U.S. Congress, which is made up of two chambers: the Senate and the House of Representatives.</p></div>`;
