Cold <i>watermelon</i> is delicious at a backyard barbecue.</p><p class="long">Like squashes and gourds, watermelons grow from long, climbing vines. The deep pink or red flesh of a watermelon, however, is uniquely sweet, juicy, and refreshing. Watermelons are originally native to Africa, and they were brought to North America and cultivated around the 16th century. For many people, it's just not summer without watermelon â€” the fruit is over 90 percent water, so it's not just delicious, but it also quenches your thirst.</p></div>`;
