Because <i>resin</i> is insoluble in water, it's useful as a base in different kinds of glue and varnishes.</p><p class="long">Resin can be found in many materials from varnishes and cement to incense and other therapeutic products.    Musicians add resin to the bows of their string instruments to help them get a little more friction.  Ballet dancers coat the bottoms of their slippers in resin powder for a similar reason â€” to keep from slipping on the floor while they dance.</p></div>`;
