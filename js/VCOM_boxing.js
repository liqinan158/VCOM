Some amateurs practice <i>boxing</i> as a way to stay in shape.</p><p class="long">If you go to a boxing match, you'll see two fighters in a ring surrounded by thick ropes. They wear protective helmets and thick, padded gloves, and their fight is monitored by a referee. Rules of boxing include not hitting below the waist, from behind, or when an opponent is on the ground. The objective, however, is to knock the other person out or hit them so hard that they can't get up within ten seconds.</p></div>`;
