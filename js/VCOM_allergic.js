Many people are <i>allergic</i> to dust.</p><p class="long">If you have an <i>allergy</i> to something, your immune system goes crazy when you come in contact with it: if this happens to you, you're <i>allergic</i>. You might be allergic to certain plants, and spend the spring with itchy eyes, for example, or sneeze every time you pet your best friend's dog. <i>Allergic</i> comes from <i>allergy</i>, from the German <i>Allergie</i>, which is rooted in the Greek word <i>allos</i>, "other, different, or strange."</p></div>`;
