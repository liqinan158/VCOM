It would be <i>intolerable</i> if your neighbors played their terrible, loud music all night long.</p><p class="long"><i>Intolerable</i>, <i>tolerable</i>, <i>tolerate</i>, <i>tolerant</i>, and even <i>extol</i> all share the same Latin root word <i>tolerare</i>, which means to bear. <i>Intolerable</i> couples that with the prefix <i>in-</i>, which means not, giving the word its unbearable meaning. The Intolerable Acts, for example, were laws passed by the British Parliament in 1774. The American colonists found them unendurable, and they sparked support for the independence movement, which eventually led to the Declaration of Independence in 1776.</p></div>`;
