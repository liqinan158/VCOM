You can <i>tease</i> your little sister by saying "nanny nanny boo boo" or by holding a cookie just out of her reach.</p><p class="long"><i>Tease</i>, a modern spelling of the Old English <i>taesan</i> “pluck, pull apart" is now associated with the act of harassing. You can still use <i>tease</i> as a verb, though, to describe the act of backcombing your hair to give it volume. But more commonly, <i>tease</i> refers to messing with someone. There’s an old proverb, “Patience when teased is often transformed into rage,” which means if you tease someone a lot, you might get your booty kicked!</p></div>`;
