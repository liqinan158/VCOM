The blade of an <i>epee</i> is heavier and stiffer than those of other types of fencing swords. Use your <i>epee</i> with caution!</p><p class="long"><i>Epee</i> comes from the French <i>épée</i>, or "sword," and the sword itself is a descendent of the 19th century fighting weapon called the <i>Épée de Combat</i>. These original epees ended in sharp points, while a sport fencer's epee is blunt. In fencing, there are three weapons, including the <i>foil</i> and <i>sabre</i>. When using an epee, fencers can use the opponent's entire body as a target — each "touch" is registered as a point.</p></div>`;
