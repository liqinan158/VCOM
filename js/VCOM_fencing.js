Another kind of <i>fencing</i> is a sport with long pointy foils that has been popular with Hamlet, Holden Caulfield, and lots of other fancy kids.</p><p class="long">You might buy enough fencing to close in your whole back yard â€” it could be made of wood, metal, or even plastic, and this material can also be called <i>fencing</i>. A completely different kind of <i>fencing</i> is the sport that involves combat with sword-like weapons. Fencing started as military training and a way of settling disputes, but it grew into a sport during the 18th century, and is now even included in the Olympics.</p></div>`;
