A counterfeit hundred dollar bill is not bona fide. When you earn your college diploma you're a bona fide college graduate. If you spend your whole life studying music, you're a bona fide musician. The opposite of bona fide is fake. We also say people make a bona fide effort: they're making a true, sincere attempt to do something.</p></div></div>`;
