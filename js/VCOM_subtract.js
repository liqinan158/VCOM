If you <i>subtract</i> four from ten, you're left with six. You can also use <i>subtract</i> to mean "take away" in a more general sense, as in "If you <i>subtract</i> some of the salt from the recipe, the pasta will be healthier."</p><p class="long">When you're doing math, you know you're supposed to subtract if you see a minus sign. Subtracting gives you the difference between numbers, and you can see this in a real way when you subtract actual objects instead of numbers. If you have a dozen cupcakes and subtract ten of them, you have only two cupcakes left. The Latin root of <i>subtract</i> is <i>subtrahere</i>, "take away or draw off."</p></div>`;
