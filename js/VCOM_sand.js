The <i>sand</i> on some beaches is rough and pebbly, while other <i>sand</i> is smooth and soft. Either way, don't track it into the house.</p><p class="long">You can find sand on riverbanks, in flower beds, and in sandboxes, among many other places. Grains of sand are composed of rocks and coral that have been worn down over the years. As a verb, <i>sand</i> means "make smooth with sandpaper." There's also an old fashioned colloquial way to use this word, to mean "determination" or "grit." So you could say, "I'm impressed that she had the <i>sand</i> to travel in India by herself!"</p></div>`;
