And, if you say it well, someone might praise you by saying you are <i>articulate</i>. Confused yet? It's all in the pronunciation.</p><p class="long">Reach for <i>articulate</i> when you need an adjective meaning "well-spoken" (pronounced ar-TIC-yuh-lit) or a verb (ar-TIC-yuh-late) meaning "to speak or express yourself clearly." The key to understanding <i>articulate</i>'s many uses is to think of the related noun <i>article</i>: an articulate person clearly pronounces each article of his or her speech (that is, each word and syllable), and an articulated joint is divided up into distinct articles, or parts.</p></div></div>`;
