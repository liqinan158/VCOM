You loathe it, abhor it, hate it, and think it's vile.</p><p class="long"><i>Despise</i> dates all the way back to the Latin word <i>despicare</i>, which combines <i>de</i> "down" with <i>specere</i> "to look at." So if you look down your nose at something, you could say you despise it. Nowadays the word gets used a lot to describe things people really, really dislike, too. Note how similar in meaning and spelling <i>despise</i> is to Sylvester the cartoon cat's old favorite catchphrase <i>despicable</i>. <i>Despicable</i> means something worth of being despised.</p></div></div>`;
