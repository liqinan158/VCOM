Saying that you misspeak implies that a mere slip of the tongue kept you from saying the right thing, and allows you to set the record straight. In the fourteenth century, to <i>misspeak</i> was both "to say amiss," and also "to speak insultingly," from the Old English <i>missprecan</i>, "to grumble."</p></div>`;
