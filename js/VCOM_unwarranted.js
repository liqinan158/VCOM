After all, all the guy did was stand there and point for two hours. And when that lady started screaming? That was <i>unwarranted</i>, too: all I did was give her a flat. It was an accident! Think of it this way: when the police want to search your home, they have to get a "warrant" â€” a document that allows them to enter. To go into your home without a warrant would be unwarranted. A warrant is a kind of justification; without that justification, something could be called <i>unwarranted</i>.</p></div></div>`;
