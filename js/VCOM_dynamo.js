It’s short for "dynamoelectric machine," which is a generator that cranks out electric currents. If someone calls you a <i>dynamo</i>, don’t get mad, it just means you’re energetic.</p><p class="long">The word <i>dynamo</i> comes from the Greek <i>dynamis</i> for "power." Boom! It’s like dynamite! The inventor of the dynamo-electric machine knew that when he named the device that turns mechanical power into electric current. Dynamos have been used to make power since the 1800’s. Since <i>dynamo</i> is such a snappy name, it’s often used to describe high-energy people, too. Is your room a disaster? Call an organizing dynamo to help you clean it up.</p></div>`;
