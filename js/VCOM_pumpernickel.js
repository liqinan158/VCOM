If you're bored with the sesame bagel, try ordering a <i>pumpernickel</i> instead.</p><p class="long">Pumpernickel is a hearty, slightly sweet bread that's made with whole-grain rye flour and traditionally has a dark brown color. While American pumpernickel bread gets its color from molasses or coffee, traditional German pumpernickel is cooked for a very long time at a low temperature to get its brown shade and sweet flavor. In German, <i>Pumpernickel</i> was originally a derogatory name for a stupid person â€” and the bread itself was first called <i>krankbrot</i>, or "sick bread."</p></div></div>`;
