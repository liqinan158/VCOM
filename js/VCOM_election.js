Mayors, governors, judges, and the President are all put in office by elections. You can also speak of the election of a winner: for example, "Her election was close." An election can also mean any kind of choice, such as "his <i>election</i> to move to Vermont." All the meanings of this word have to do with exercising choice.</p></div></div>`;
