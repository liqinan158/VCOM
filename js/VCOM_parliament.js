It's the equivalent of Congress in the United States.</p><p class="long">The most common meaning of <i>parliament</i> refers to a country's legislative (law-making) body. England's parliament is very famous. The word comes in part from the French verb <i>parler</i>, which means to speak, which makes sense since this group of people assemble to talk about laws and issues. Another meaning of <i>parliament</i> is the card game known as fan tan or sevens, where you lead with your sevens in a certain sequence and win by using up all your cards.</p></div>`;
