And a government may reorganize a country's entire economy, focusing on tourism instead of exporting oil, for example. <i>Reorganize</i> adds the "again" prefix <i>re-</i> to <i>organize</i>, a verb rooted in the Latin <i>organum</i>, "instrument or tool." <i>Organize</i> is related to <i>organ</i>, and its very earliest meaning was "arrange into a living being."</p></div>`;
