Shouting, "Sit! Stay!" <i>imperiously</i> might work well on the dog, but it won't necessarily work on your friends.</p><p class="long"><i>Imperiously</i> comes from the Latin word <i>imperare</i>, which means "to command." Other words from this same root include <i>empire</i>, <i>emperor</i>, <i>imperial</i>, and <i>imperative</i>. Like <i>imperiously</i>, all of these words retain some sense of command in their definitions. When you were three, you might have imperiously announced to your toys that they must come to life immediately, or you would banish them to the dark wasteland known as the closet.</p></div></div>`;
