If you spin the wool from your sheep into yarn, and then make a dress out of it, it won’t be as fine or precise as fabric spun in a factory. Back in the day when large portions of the population couldn't afford milled cloth, homespun fabric marked you as poor, or just a farmer living off the land. Today we use <i>homespun</i> to describe anything that seems homemade, simple, or folksy, from homespun linens to homespun philosophies of life.</p></div>`;
