var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">dare</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you challenge or provoke someone to try something risky, it's a <i>dare</i>. If you accept a <i>dare</i>, you're probably trying to prove how brave you are.</p><p class="long">When you challenge your friend to a dare, you <i>dare</i> him. You might, for example, dare your brother to jump off the garage into a pile of leaves. Another way to dare is to actually be brave: "I admire her so much, because she <i>dares</i> to stand up to bullies." The Old English root of <i>dare</i> is <i>durran</i>, "to brave danger, venture, or presume." If you say, "How <i>dare</i> you?" you're expressing outrage or indignation.</p></div>`;
