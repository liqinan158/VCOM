An indemnity may also keep something or someone from being held responsible for harm. Protection indemnity is mainly offered for unlikely events. If you regularly crash hot-air balloons, you won’t get indemnity for the next one you rent. In fact, the balloon rental company will probably demand their own indemnity in case you crash again.</p></div>`;
