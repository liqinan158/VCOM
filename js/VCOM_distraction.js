If you just can't keep from checking your email every ten seconds, that's a <i>distraction</i> that's going to interfere with doing your homework.</p><p class="long">A distraction can also be a pleasant break. If you're worried about your dance recital tomorrow, watching a mindless action flick may be a welcome distraction that helps you relax. Has anyone ever told you, "You're driving me to distraction"?  When you're driven to distraction, you're so agitated you feel like you're going crazy. <i>Distraction</i> comes from the Latin <i>dis-,</i> "apart," and <i>trahere,</i> "drag." So distraction is when you're dragged away from your task or from your worries.</p></div></div>`;
