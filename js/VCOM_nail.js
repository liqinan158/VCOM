When you go to a <i>nail</i> salon, however, don't bring a pack of <i>nails</i>; bring your toes and fingers instead!</p><p class="long">When construction workers pound nails into wood, they nail them. Another kind of nail is the one at the end of each of your fingers and toes. In addition to hitting a nail, the verb version of <i>nail</i> also means "to arrest," "to succeed easily," and "to hit." Nail polish is what you use to color the nails on your hands (or feet), and when you "hit the <i>nail</i> on the head," you get the exact right answer.</p></div>`;
