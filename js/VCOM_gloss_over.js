A college tour guide might highlight the shiny new equipment in the chemistry labs but <i>gloss over</i> the disgusting food in the dining halls.</p><p class="long">Whenever someone is being evasive, quickly bypassing or skimming a subject as if it just didn't matter, you may want to ask if they mean to gloss over the issue. You might, for example, draw your parents' attention to the fact that you cleaned the kitchen while they were out and gloss over the fact that you broke their serving bowl in the process.</p></div>`;
