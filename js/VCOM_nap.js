In some cultures, everybody naps after lunch, while in other places naps are only for young children and elderly people. Sigh. A second meaning of <i>nap</i> is "slightly fuzzy texture," like the nap of a jacket or the nap of a rug. This kind of <i>nap</i> stems from the Middle Low German <i>noppe</i>, "tuft of wool."</p></div>`;
