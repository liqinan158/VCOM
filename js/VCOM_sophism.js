Inventing statistics to back up your personal belief that dogs are smarter than humans is one example of <i>sophism</i>.</p><p class="long">Fact-checking the statements politicians make is important, in order to uncover sophisms they might be using. If a candidate falsely claims that the crime rate in a city is rising so that he can gain the support of voters who believe he'll be tough on crime, his statement is a sophism. The word comes from the Old French <i>sophime</i>, "fallacy or false argument," and its root, the Greek <i>sophisma</i>, "clever device or stage trick."</p></div>`;
