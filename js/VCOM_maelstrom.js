A luckless ship might go down in one, and conflicting ocean currents might cause one. These days, you're more likely to hear <i>maelstrom</i> used metaphorically to describe disasters where many competing forces are at play.</p><p class="long">When an economy or a government fails, the situation is often described as a maelstrom. Following some precipitous event, all the forces at play — banks, governments, consumers — are trying as hard as they can to protect themselves. This creates a maelstrom — a perfect storm, so to speak — that drags any potential for rescue down with it. <i>Maelstrom</i> comes from an obsolete Dutch phrase meaning "whirling stream."</p></div>`;
