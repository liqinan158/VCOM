Figuratively, your <i>pocketbook</i> is your budget: "Those shoes are way too expensive for my <i>pocketbook</i>." In the early 1600s, a pocketbook was "a book small enough to fit in a pocket," and by 1722 it became "a booklike leather folder for papers." In the early 1800s, it came to mean "woman's handbag."</p></div>`;
