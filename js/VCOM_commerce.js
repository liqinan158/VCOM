Competition between cities wanting to host the Olympics is fierce because the games increase tourism and <i>commerce.</i></p><p class="long"><i>Commerce</i> made its way into English from the Latin word <i>commercium</i> â€” <i>com-,</i> meaning "together," and <i>-mercium,</i> meaning "merchandise." <i>Business,</i> <i>trade,</i> and <i>retailing</i> are all common synonyms. <i>Commerce</i> doesn't always refer to buying and selling, though, just as the marketplace doesn't always refer to goods and services. Data, information, and opinions, too, can be exchanged and traded, as on the Internet, which is a great place for the <i>commerce</i> of ideas.</p></div>`;
