If you want to remember a summer trip taken with friends, you could make a photo album full of the pictures you took to <i>memorialize</i> it.</p><p class="long">The word <i>memorialize</i> often is used in relation to someone or something that has passed away or even to a group of connected individuals who have perished. You might see a monument, for example, that memorializes victims of an earthquake, meaning pays tribute to them. You can also memorialize someone in a speech, meaning you tell about the person's life and describe how he or she has affected others.</p></div>`;
