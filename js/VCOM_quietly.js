When you sneak down to the kitchen for that last piece of pie, you should tiptoe <i>quietly</i> past the rooms of your sleeping siblings.</p><p class="long">If the librarian frowns at you, puts a finger to his lips, and says "Shhhh!", it means he would like you to speak more quietly while you're in the library. Use this adverb for anything you do in a soft, hushed, or faint way. Whisper quietly when you don't want to be overheard, and chew your food quietly unless you really want to irritate your brother.</p></div></div>`;
