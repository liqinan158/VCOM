To do something accurately is to do it in a precise, correct, careful manner. A baseball player with a good batting average hits the ball accurately. An accountant who never makes mistakes juggles the numbers accurately. If you got 100 on a test, you performed accurately. The opposite of this word is <i>inaccurately</i>, which means you did something wrong, incorrectly, or with a lot of mistakes.</p></div></div>`;
