It might be a coffee, or your favorite song, or your mom stripping the covers and standing over your bed.  Take your pick.</p><p class="long">Some people believe the word <i>nudge</i> comes from the Norwegian dialect <i>nugga</i> meaning "to push, rub." This makes sense, since a nudge is a push of sorts. But it's more of a gentle push. Think of nudging coals around in a fire or a crowd of people nudging to the stage at a concert.  When you gently annoy your husband so he'll mow the lawn, you're nudging him along.</p></div>`;
