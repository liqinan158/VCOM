If you <i>strike</i> someone, you hit them with your hand or a weapon. If lightning <i>strikes</i>, it makes contact. If you <i>strike</i> out on a trip, you're "hitting" the road. If you <i>strike</i> gold, you've "<i>struck</i> it rich"!</p><p class="long"><i>Strike</i> can also mean not to hit, as in miss –– as in "three strikes and you're out." That meaning might have evolved from <i>strike</i> meaning to cross off, as in "If you don't come to practice, coach will <i>strike</i> your name from the starting lineup." It might also have led to the idea of a labor strike. If employees want to protest their work conditions, they go on strike, or refuse to work until conditions improve.</p></div>`;
