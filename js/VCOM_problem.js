A <i>problem</i> is a roadblock in a situation, something that sets up a conflict and forces you to find a resolution.</p><p class="long">The meaning of the Greek word <i>próblēma</i> meant "to put forth," which is different from the meaning of <i>problem</i> today, but it reminds you that any problem becomes easier to solve once you have defined it.  A math problem is easier once you have the numbers in front of you: that's why word problems can be so difficult. <i>Problem</i> can also be an adjective in rare cases.  Once you were a problem child, but now you spend your time listening to everyone else's problems.</p></div>`;
