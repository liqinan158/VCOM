A ceramic artist might use a <i>kiln</i> once a week to fire the bowls he's made from clay.</p><p class="long">Some kilns look more like furnaces than ovens, and they reach temperatures far beyond regular household ovens. Electricity is used to power many modern kilns, while others use older techniques of burning wood or even coal. Making mugs and bowls is the primary use of kilns, but there are some that dry lumber, tobacco leaves, or hops as well. The Old English word was <i>cyln</i>, from the Latin root <i>culina</i>, "kitchen or cooking stove."</p></div></div>`;
