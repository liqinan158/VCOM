If your friend calls you a <i>couch potato</i>, she's criticizing the amount of time you spend lying on your couch watching television.</p><p class="long">Although you can use the expression <i>couch potato</i> to simply mean "idler" or "layabout," it usually refers specifically to someone who watches a whole lot of TV. It was first used by a 1970's comics artist who drew lazy, sedentary characters he called <i>couch potatoes</i>. From there, the phrase became an extremely popular way to talk about someone who's spent so much time in front of the TV that he seems more like a vegetable than a human being.</p></div></div>`;
