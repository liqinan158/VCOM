Perhaps your home is your <i>oasis</i>, where you can escape life's rigors. An <i>oasis</i> refers to a location, but it can also be an imagined place — as in an acting exercise where an actor builds an imaginary oasis in his or her mind. The actor can then remember the image to relax on stage.</p></div></div>`;
