var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">Panhellenic</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Anything described as <i>Panhellenic</i> has something to do with the country of Greece. The Olympics was originally just one of four <i>Panhellenic</i> sporting events regularly held by ancient Greeks.</p><p class="long">The term <i>Panhellenic</i>, not surprisingly, comes from Greek roots. <i>Pan-</i> means "all," and <i>Hellenic</i>, or "Greek," comes from <i>Hellen</i>, "a Greek." So when something is Panhellenic, it's connected to all of Greece or all Greek people. The most well-known Panhellenic poet is Homer. You may also encounter this word in connection with an American college fraternity or sorority: "My mom still stays in touch with her Panhellenic sisters."</p></div>`;
