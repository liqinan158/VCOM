It would be a little startling if your friend said, "I'd like to introduce you to my <i>inamorata</i>," though you'd know he meant "the woman I love." The male version of an inamorata is <i>inamorato</i>, which is even more rarely used. Both words come from the Italian <i>innamorare</i>, "to fall in love."</p></div></div>`;
