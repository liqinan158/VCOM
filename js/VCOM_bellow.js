If you constantly <i>bellow</i> at other drivers on the road, consider signing up for anger management classes.</p><p class="long"><i>Bellow</i> comes from Middle English, and means "to roar like a bull." A cow's deep moo is called a <i>low</i>, so <i>bellow</i> just adds a big angry bull to the standard moo. We use <i>bellow</i> for human speech that has that angry power of a loud bovine, or for any loud, threatening noise. It can be a noun, as in the bellow of the thundercloud, or a verb, as when you bellow at your kid brother.</p></div>`;
