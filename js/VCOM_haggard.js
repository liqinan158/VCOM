An emotional ordeal, like losing a loved one, can also give someone a haggard appearance if they forget to eat, sleep, and take care of themselves. Whatever the ordeal, it will make the person look absolutely awful â€” pale, gaunt, disheveled, exhausted with dark circles under their eyes and wild, unruly hair.</p></div>`;
