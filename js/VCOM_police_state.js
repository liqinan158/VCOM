var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">police state</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A government that controls the activities of its citizens using a police force or military is a <i>police state</i>. Before World War II, there was a rise of <i>police states</i> in Europe.</p><p class="long">You could also call a police state a "dictatorship" or a "totalitarian government." The first use of <i>police state</i> can be traced back to Austria in the 1850s, when order was kept by a national police force. The definition varies depending on the values of the person using the term â€” some think if a government uses electronic or digital surveillance it's a police state, while others believe it takes the loss of more freedoms to make a police state.</p></div></div>`;
