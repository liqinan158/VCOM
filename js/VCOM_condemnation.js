If your little brother does something unspeakably awful, express your <i>condemnation</i> so he will learn not to do it again.</p><p class="long"><i>Condemnation</i> comes from the verb <i>condemn,</i> "to strongly disapprove." You might criticize something that you still think is worthwhile, but if you express condemnation, that’s laying a heavy moral blame. <i>Condemnation</i> is used in law, and means the same thing as sentencing; you might have heard a judge say “I condemn you to ten years of hard labor.” Also, a very dangerous building will be sealed up and deemed uninhabitable by an act of condemnation.</p></div></div>`;
