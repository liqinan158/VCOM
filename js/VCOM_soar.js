Flying is just moving through the air. <i>Soaring</i>, though, suggests exhilaration, even joy.</p><p class="long">Think about the anticipation you feel when you buy a lottery ticket â€” your hopes soar as you contemplate the possibilities. It's the same wonderful feeling you get when someone you have a crush on notices you, when you land that perfect job, when you hold your child. The word <i>soar</i> comes from the Latin, <i>ex-</i>, which means "out," and <i>aura</i>, meaning "breeze, air," together meaning "out of the air," which is precisely how it feels to soar.</p></div>`;
