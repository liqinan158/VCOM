If you pick your nose, your mom will probably yell at you. If you pick your nose in front of the Queen of England, your mom will <i>chastise</i> you.</p><p class="long">Back in the Middle Ages, <i>chastise</i> used to also come with a beating â€” that sense of the word has passed, and in fact, people tend to use <i>chastise</i> when they are trying to accuse someone else of overreacting. "You're chastising me for forgetting to feed the cat, but it's not like the cat died!"</p></div></div>`;
