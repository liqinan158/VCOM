The terms <i>mudslinger</i> and <i>mudslinging</i> began as "dirt throwing," probably from the Latin saying, "Throw plenty of dirt and some of it will be sure to stick." Some time in the late 1800s, this changed to <i>mud-throwing</i>, <i>mud-gunning</i>, and what was ultimately the term to stick, <i>mudslinging</i>.</p></div></div>`;
