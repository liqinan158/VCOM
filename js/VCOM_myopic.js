Whether you need glasses or a new attitude, if you can't see the forest for the trees, you're <i>myopic</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Myopic</i> began as a description of the condition that made people squint and was easily cured with a pair of pink cat-eye glasses, but it came to include people or plans with a lack of foresight. Although it's good to live in the moment, it's not a compliment to be called <i>myopic</i> â€” a <i>myopic</i> party host might have festive decorations but no food for hungry guests, and <i>myopic</i> students have no interest in anything beyond what's on the test. In terms of pronunciation: it's a <i>tomato/tomahto</i> word: pronounce it "my-OP-ick" or "my-OH-pick," although that short <i>o</i> sound is preferred.</p></div>`;
