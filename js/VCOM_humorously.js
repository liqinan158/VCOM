If you're auditioning for a role in a comedy, be sure to deliver your lines <i>humorously</i>.</p><p class="long">If you do a lot of things humorously, you probably also find yourself saying, "Just kidding!" all the time. This adverb implies playfulness and a joking quality, so you might speak humorously about a serious subject to lighten the mood, or write humorously in order to make your friends giggle helplessly when they read your story. The word comes from <i>humor</i>, which today means "the quality of being amusing," but originally meant "bodily fluid."</p></div></div>`;
