So you can use the word for hair with a little curl  — whether it's the waviness of your new hair style or your poodle's swirly fur — but also for the moving surface of ocean water. You might sit in a sailboat and admire the waviness of the sail that's blowing in the wind and the waviness of the water below.</p></div></div>`;
