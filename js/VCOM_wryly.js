This word describes an action that is amusing — or shows amusement — in a droll, sardonic, ironic or grim way. Biting one-liners and deadpan jokes alike are uttered wryly. If you publicly insist you could dunk a basketball but are under six feet tall, you might see a few pairs of eyebrows raised wryly in your direction.</p></div>`;
