Another kind of cross is a written mark, an upended <i>X</i> on a piece of paper. There's also the adjective <i>cross</i>, which describes someone who is extremely cranky. The Latin root word <i>crux</i> means "stake or cross," but its figurative meaning, "trouble or misery," is related to to traditional use of wooden crosses to hang criminals.</p></div>`;
