They were hunted for food by Native Americans, but when Europeans arrived — and especially after about 1800 — their numbers began to decline. By the early 1900s, passenger pigeons were extinct. The Seneca people called this bird <i>jahgowa</i>, or "big bread," and the Choctaws called it, more poetically, <i>putchee nashoba</i>, "lost dove."</p></div>`;
