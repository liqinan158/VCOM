If you’re Scottish, your family may have an <i>emblem</i> such as a coat of arms that symbolizes your heritage.</p><p class="long">Many countries have national emblems, which often feature an animal or other elements that represent significant parts of the country’s history. A national emblem is often shown on flags or official documents such as passports. An emblem can also be an object that represents an idea. An expensive skyscraper could be an emblem of greed, for example, or the apple tree you planted in your backyard could be an emblem of hope.</p></div>`;
