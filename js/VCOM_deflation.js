Bummer.</p><p class="long">When economists talk about inflation, they mean that prices are very high, and it takes more cash to buy things. Deflation is the opposite—it's also known as a negative inflation rate. Deflation is dangerous for the economy, and it's connected with era like the Great Depression of the 1930s. <i>Deflation</i> literally means "a loss of air," and you can use it that way too: "The <i>deflation</i> of my tires meant I wasn't going anywhere."</p></div>`;
