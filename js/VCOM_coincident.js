So when you have two similar noteworthy events that happen together, they are coincident with one other.  Professional dancers have dance moves coincident with one another.  If you immediately know the answer to a question your teacher asks, your knowledge is coincident with the lessons being taught.  Congrats, smarty pants.</p></div>`;
