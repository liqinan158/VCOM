The term is rather old-fashioned â€” it was commonly used to refer to such men in the 1800s, like the famous <i>dandy</i> Beau Brummell.</p><p class="long">As an adjective, <i>dandy</i> means excellent. If you think your new car is dandy, you're excited to own such a great car. In modern use, <i>dandy</i> is often used sarcastically, with just a small change in wording or emphasis: "My new car is just <i>dandy</i>. It's broken down twice today already!"
