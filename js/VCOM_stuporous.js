A patient who's had surgery often wakes up feeling stuporous, and going without sleep for several days will leave almost anyone stuporous. If you're stuporous, you're in a <i>stupor</i>, or not quite fully conscious. In Latin, <i>stupor</i> means "insensibility, numbness, or dullness," from <i>stupere</i>, or "be stunned."</p></div>`;
