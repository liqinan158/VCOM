var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">surely</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the adverb <i>surely</i> to emphasize your certainty about a point. For example, you could tell your friend that her painting is so good that she'll <i>surely</i> win the art contest.</p><p class="long">The word <i>surely</i> can fill in for <i>definitely</i> or <i>absolutely</i>. It comes in handy especially when you're surprised that anyone would doubt what you're saying: "I can't believe the school banned that book. <i>Surely</i> kids should have access to classic literature." <i>Surely</i> comes from the same roots as <i>sure</i>, from the Old French <i>seur</i>, "secure, undoubted, or dependable," and the Latin <i>securus</i>, "free from care, untroubled, or safe."</p></div></div>`;
