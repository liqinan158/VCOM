The Greek root word is <i>lykanthropos</i>, literally "wolf-man." In the late 1500s, a lycanthrope was a mentally ill person who believed that he was a wolf. Popular myths and stories of humans changing into wolves changed the meaning of <i>lycanthrope</i> to mean an actual monstrous creature.</p></div>`;
