If you <i>wipe out</i> your grandmother's entire batch of brownies, it means that you eat every single last one of them.</p><p class="long">You might wipe out your life's savings gambling in Las Vegas, or — more positively — wipe out your credit card debt by paying a little each month for a year. In either case, you've erased or eliminated something. Sometimes <i>wipe out</i> is used to describe a truly terrible event, as when a disease wipes out a country's population of songbirds.</p></div>`;
