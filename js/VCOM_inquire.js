If you wonder about how the world began, you <i>inquire</i> about its origin.</p><p class="long"><i>Inquire</i> comes from the Latin combination of words <i>in,</i> meaning "into" and <i>qu√¶rere,</i> meaning "ask, seek." When you inquire, you look into something. You might ask a question, like inquiring if the bakery is hiring any cake decorators. <i>Inquire</i> can also mean "to conduct an investigation." No matter how you do it, when you inquire, you seek answers.</p></div>`;
