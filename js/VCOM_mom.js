Mothers with young children hear this word about 10,000 times a day, usually all in a row. <i>Mom</i>. <i>Mom</i>. <i>Mom</i>. You get the idea.</p><p class="long"><i>Mom</i> is a very common informal word in the U.S. for “mother,” shortened from <i>momma</i> or <i>mommy</i>, an even more childish nickname for your mother. If you’re talking directly to your mom, using “mom” like a name, capitalize it – "Hi, Mom!" If you’re talking about her or another mom, don’t – "Hi, other person’s mom." In other English-speaking parts of the world, people might use <i>mum</i> instead.</p></div>`;
