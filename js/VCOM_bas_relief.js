Most coins have images stamped on them in <i>bas relief</i>.</p><p class="long">In general, <i>relief</i> makes an artwork look like the picture is raised up from a flat background. There are two types of relief, high and low — or bas — relief. Bas relief is distinguished by the relative shallowness of the image, and you can see it in a lot of ancient Egyptian art. The French <i>bas-relief</i> is borrowed from the Italian <i>basso-rilievo</i>, "low relief" or "raised work."</p></div>`;
