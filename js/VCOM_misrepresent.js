You might misrepresent the reliability of an old car you're trying to sell or accidentally misrepresent an author's intentions in a school book report. The word itself is built from the Old English prefix <i>mis-</i>, which means "bad or wrong," and <i>represent</i>, or "depict, describe, or symbolize."</p></div>`;
