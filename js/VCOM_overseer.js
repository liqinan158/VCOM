On a road crew that's busy fixing potholes, the <i>overseer</i> is the person who supervises the other workers.</p><p class="long">While the word <i>overseer</i> is used these days for anyone who works as an official supervisor, especially of a crew doing manual labor, the word was most common in the U.S. when slavery was legal. On a plantation where enslaved people were forced to work, it was the overseer's job to make sure they were productive, ensuring that the plantation owner made as much money as possible. Overseers could, and often did, brutally punish enslaved workers.</p></div>`;
