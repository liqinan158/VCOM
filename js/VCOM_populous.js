If you left your cabin in the Maine woods to spend the weekend in New York City, you'd be particularly aware of how <i>populous</i> the city is.</p><p class="long">Anything that's dense with people can be described as populous, like the country of China or the city of Mumbai or even a crowded airport. <i>Populous</i> is a Latin word that means simply "people." It was adopted by English in the 15th century to mean "full of people." The adjective <i>populous</i> is easy to confuse with the noun <i>populace</i>, "the people who live in a country," especially since they are homonyms, or words that sound exactly the same.</p></div></div>`;
