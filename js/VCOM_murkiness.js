You may note the <i>murkiness</i> of a pond and, fearing leeches (or sea monsters), decide not to swim with your friends.</p><p class="long">Your sailboat might cut through the murkiness of a foggy bay, and an alligator hunter might brave a swamp's murkiness. Figuratively, <i>murkiness</i> can mean a state of being unclear, sometimes deliberately: "The murkiness of those back-room deals makes me very distrustful of the whole organization." <i>Murkiness</i> comes from the noun <i>murk</i>, "darkness that makes it difficult to see."</p></div></div>`;
