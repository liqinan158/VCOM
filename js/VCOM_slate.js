The rock can be split into thin layers and the <i>slate</i> used for things like roofing tiles.</p><p class="long">In the past when paper was expensive, schoolchildren used <i>slates</i> to do their school work. These were usually made of actual slate rock. Students could practice their writing on the slate with a slate pencil. When they were done, the slate could be erased, which gave rise to the term "clean <i>slate</i>." If you've done things in the past you aren't proud of, you may hope to start over with a clean slate.</p></div>`;
