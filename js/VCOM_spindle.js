If your aunt has a spinning wheel for making yarn from the wool of her sheep, it must have a <i>spindle</i> on it for twisting the fibers.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>spindle</i> can be used to talk about a number of different forms of wooden rod or dowel, particularly if they turn or spin. A yarn spinner's spindle is one kind â€” another is a chair leg or a banister rail that was made from being turned on a lathe. In fact, <i>spindle</i> and <i>spin</i> share a common root word, the Old English <i>spinnan</i>, "draw out and twist fibers into a thread."</p></div></div>`;
