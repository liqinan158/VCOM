Remember the Reverend Martin Luther King? He was a fervent believer in <i>egalitarianism</i>.</p><p class="long">Egalitarianism is a set of beliefs that generally promote equality for all mankind â€” regardless of gender, race, religious orientation, etc. An egalitarian is someone who practices egalitarianism, perhaps by promoting laws giving equal protection to women in the workplace or by advocating for illegal immigrants to have the same rights as citizens. The opposite of <i>egalitarianism</i> is <i>elitism</i>, which is the belief that certain people have a right to have their opinions heard more than others.</p></div></div>`;
