You can also roll out dough for a pie — by flattening it with a rolling pin — or roll up a car window, which once required turning a handle, but today usually involves pushing a button. You can roll dice, or toss them on a table, and tears can roll, or drip, down your cheeks. As a noun, a <i>roll</i> can be an individual loaf of bread, a list of names, or a cylinder.</p></div>`;
