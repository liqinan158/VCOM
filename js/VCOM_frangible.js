You might scold your little sister, "Hey, don't throw that plate like a Frisbee! It's <i>frangible</i>!"</p><p class="long">Frangible things can be broken, and they're especially likely to be described this way if they're brittle or crumbly. If your pizza crust is thin, crisp and cracker-like, you can call it frangible. The pages of a very old book you find in your attic might also be frangible. More figuratively, you could describe your easily injured feelings as frangible too. The Latin root is <i>frangere</i>, which means "to break."</p></div></div>`;
