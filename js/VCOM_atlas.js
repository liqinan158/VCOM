Consult an <i>atlas</i>, a book of maps, and you’ll find the information you need.</p><p class="long">An atlas gets its name from the Greek god Atlas, who, according to myth, was forced to bear the weight of the heavens on his shoulders. You might feel like Atlas if you have to carry one of these books around. Atlases are usually large, oversized books that contain maps, diagrams, and information such as population figures. Traditionally, <i>atlas</i> refers specifically to a bound book of maps rather than to a folding map, a globe, or an online database.</p></div></div>`;
