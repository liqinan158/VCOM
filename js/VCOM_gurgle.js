Your stomach might gurgle too, especially when you're hungry. And liquid itself gurgles, like a stream that gurgles over rocks or sweet iced tea that gurgles from a bottle into your glass. Experts aren't sure if <i>gurgle</i> is an imitative word, from the sound itself, or if it's rooted in Latin.</p></div></div>`;
