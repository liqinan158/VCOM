Your big, spooky house with its long, <i>tenebrous</i> passageways and dark corners would be a perfect place to have a Halloween party.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>tenebrous</i> is a perfect way to describe something that's dark and creepy, like a weirdly shadowed room in a castle or a gloomy cave. You can also use <i>tenebrous</i> to talk about things that are figuratively dark, or obscure, like a tenebrous deal made between a city's mayor and the Mafia.
