Many Catholics, for example, believe that bread and wine are <i>consecrated</i>, or made sacred during Holy Communion, becoming the body and blood of Christ.</p><p class="long">The word <i>consecrated</i> is made up of the Latin suffix <i>con-</i>, which expresses intensive force and <i>sacrare</i>, meaning "dedicate." Something that is consecrated is intensely dedicated to the point of being declared holy. It's not just bread and wine that people believe to be consecrated. You might call a cemetery "consecrated ground."</p></div>`;
