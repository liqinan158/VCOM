You thought you'd be able to hit that can with a rock, but it fell short, so you'll have to try throwing it <i>farther</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>farther</i> is good for measurable things, things that are far far away or at least farther than something else. If your blindfolded friend is missing the piñata, tell her, "go farther to the left." It’s often confused with <i>further</i>, which is good for abstractions, like when your teacher asks you to take an argument further. So use <i>far</i> for space, and <i>fur</i> for ideas (and animals).</p></div>`;
