When you feel <i>dysphoria</i> — and we hope you rarely do — you feel depressed and awful.</p><p class="long">Euphoria is a state of joy or bliss: dysphoria is the opposite. It’s a state of unease, anxiety, and misery. Dysphoria is very similar to depression, which is also a form of extreme sadness. This is a strong word for more than being bummed: it indicates true misery. Shakespeare’s Hamlet is a well-known literary figure who wrestles with dysphoria.</p></div>`;
