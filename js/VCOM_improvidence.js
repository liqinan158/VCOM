It was your own <i>improvidence</i> that led you to spend all your money on video games instead of saving for your upcoming trip to Disneyland.</p><p class="long">You may think of your tendency to stand up in moving vehicles or jump from high places as spontaneity or playfulness, but it can also be seen as improvidence. Spending money irresponsibly or extravagantly is also commonly described as improvidence. However you use this word, it should always convey a lack of foresight, or neglecting to think about the future. The Latin roots are <i>im-</i>, "not," and <i>providentia</i>, "foresight."</p></div>`;
