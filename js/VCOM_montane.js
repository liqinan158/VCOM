If you move to the Rockies, you can call your new house a <i>montane</i> home.</p><p class="long">You're most likely to find the adjective <i>montane</i> in a scholarly book or article about the ecosystem known as a montane forest. These are forests found at high altitudes, but not high enough for growth to be so limited that trees can't take root there. When there's a timberline or forest line on a mountain, that's typically the highest part of a montane forest. The Latin root of <i>montane</i> is the Latin <i>mons</i>, or "mountain."</p></div></div>`;
