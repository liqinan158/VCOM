Some people like the cake part of a cupcake, and others just like to lick off the <i>icing</i>. If you're over five, that's really not acceptable.</p><p class="long">Most icing consists of powdered sugar mixed with butter, margarine, cream cheese, or egg whites. In fact, in Britain, powdered sugar is called "<i>icing</i> sugar." Colloquially, you can describe something as the "<i>icing</i> on the cake," meaning it's not vital, but it's a positive addition: "After such a great day, finding that fifty dollar bill on the ground was just the <i>icing</i> on the cake!"</p></div></div>`;
