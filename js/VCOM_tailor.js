Similarly, when you <i>tailor</i> something to the needs of others, you are adjusting what you do to best suit them rather than taking a general approach.</p><p class="long">The word <i>tailor</i> comes from the Latin <i>taliare</i>, meaning "to cut." A tailor is someone who cuts and adjusts your clothing to better fit. When you tailor a jacket, you have it taken in to better suit your physique.  But tailor isn't used strictly in reference to clothing. For example, a restaurant might tailor an order for a vegetarian by getting rid of the meat in a portion.  A teacher might tailor a lesson plan to the demands of her ESL students.</p></div></div>`;
