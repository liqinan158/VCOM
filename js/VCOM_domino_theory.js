It’s also the political idea that if one nation “falls” to communism, neighboring countries will follow.</p><p class="long">The concept behind the domino theory imagines neighboring countries falling, one by one, like dominoes, under the influence of a political ideology or event. Starting in the 1950s, the United States became concerned about the spread of communism, and President Eisenhower first mentioned his domino theory in 1954. This theory was mentioned by successive politicians through the 1980s. If you’re not talking about politics, the domino theory can refer to anything that causes a chain reaction.</p></div>`;
