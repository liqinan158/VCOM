Things that exist are in a state of being: this meaning of <i>being</i> is a little vague, but it has to do with the way things are alive and real. The other meaning is easier: beings are living things. Every person is a being, and so is every animal. Beings are no longer in a state of being when they're dead.</p></div>`;
