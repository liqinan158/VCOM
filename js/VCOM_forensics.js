Whenever scientific methods are applied to a criminal investigation, that's forensics. Dusting for fingerprints, measuring the depth of tire tracks, and studying the direction of a bullet's path are all aspects of forensics. The word's Latin root is <i>forensis</i>, "in open court," and today much of the evidence uncovered by forensics is eventually presented in open court, as part of a legal case.</p></div>`;
