If you dream of a trip to some tropical <i>locale</i>, Hawaii, Belize, and Costa Rica might all be on your wish list.</p><p class="long">When you choose a locale for a big sci-fi convention, you need to make sure there's enough room for all the participants. And when you decide on a locale for an intimate party, you might stick to a cozy spot like your own living room. <i>Locale</i> comes from the French <i>local</i>, and it was originally spelled the same way. The <i>e</i> was eventually added to encourage correct pronunciation, with the emphasis on the last syllable.</p></div></div>`;
