A good place to find <i>crawfish</i> is the southeastern region of the United States â€” in fact, the <i>crawfish</i> is the official state crustacean of Louisiana!</p><p class="long">Depending on where you are, you may hear crawfish referred to as "crayfish," "crawdads," "freshwater lobsters," or even "mudbugs." This last name comes from the crustacean's tendency to hang out in muddy freshwater streams, brooks, swamps, and ditches. The word <i>crawfish</i> comes from <i>crayfish</i> and its Old French source, <i>escrevisse </i>. If you order crawfish in restaurant, be prepared to crack them open and peel them like shrimp.</p></div></div>`;
