You can also be professionally diplomatic — diplomats are important members of the U.S. State Department. Diplomats keep the peace and maintain good relationships with other countries, even as they try to get other countries to see and do things our way. That's why keeping the peace in smaller ways is also called diplomatic.</p></div>`;
