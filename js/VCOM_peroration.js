If the speech really drags on, you might find yourself hoping for its <i>peroration</i>, as <i>peroration</i> can also refer to a speech's conclusion.</p><p class="long"><i>Peroration</i> comes from the Latin root <i>orare</i>, meaning "to speak." This ancestry places <i>peroration</i> in the same word family as <i>oration</i>, meaning "a formal speech," and <i>perorate</i>, meaning "to speak at length." A peroration is usually a step above your run-of-the-mill speech, or even a typical oration, as it involves an extended spoken spectacle filled with elaborate and persuasive language.</p></div>`;
