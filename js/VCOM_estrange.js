Really, <i>estrange</i> means to push apart people who were once close to each other and cause them to be like strangers.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>estrange</i> comes from the Old French <i>estranger</i>, "to treat like a stranger.” <i>Estrange</i> is often used when talking about family members who are no longer in contact with each other. You can also speak about wanting to estrange the neighbor’s dog from your flowerbed or a writer who estranges her readers by using too many big words. If you're looking for a synonym that is less “strange” but more “alien,” try <i>alienate</i>.</p></div>`;
