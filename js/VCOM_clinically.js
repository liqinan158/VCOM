On the other hand, when a doctor treats you clinically at your yearly appointment, she is efficient but aloof, rather than warm and welcoming. <i>Clinically</i> is from <i>clinical</i>, from the Latin <i>clinicus</i>, "physician who visits patients in their beds," with the Greek root <i>klinike</i>, "at the sickbed."</p></div>`;
