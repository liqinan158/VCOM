When symptoms of an illness hang out together, they call it a <i>syndrome</i>.  If you receive an invitation, politely decline.</p><p class="long"><i>Syndrome</i> comes from a Greek word that combines the root “to run” (<i>dramein</i>) with the prefix “together” (<i>sun-</i>).  When many or all of the symptoms for a disease “run together,”  that's a syndrome.  You can also use <i>syndrome</i> in a figurative way to describe a type or pattern of behavior.  If you have the “I'll do it tomorrow” syndrome, you put off doing a lot of things.  At least you got around to reading about <i>syndrome</i> today.</p></div></div>`;
