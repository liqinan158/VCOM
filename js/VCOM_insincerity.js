You might detect a politician's <i>insincerity</i> during a speech, and decide to vote for his opponent, who seems more honest.</p><p class="long">If you can't stand insincerity, you'll bristle when someone compliments your haircut in a false, overly enthusiastic way â€” you can tell they're not being forthright with you. <i>Sincerity</i>, the complete absence of any pretense, comes from the Latin <i>sincerus</i>, "whole, clean, or pure," or "genuine." <i>Insincerity</i> adds the "not" prefix <i>in-</i>, resulting in a meaning of "not genuine."</p></div></div>`;
