Most people like to put a little <i>honey</i> in their tea, but Winnie the Pooh likes to hoard it in a big pot.</p><p class="long">Honey comes in various consistencies â€” from almost solid, in honeycomb, to drippy and liquid. Bees produce honey and store it for food, and humans often take advantage of this, harvesting the honey for themselves. <i>Honey</i> is also a color, the golden shade of most honey, and a verb, meaning "to add <i>honey</i>," or "to make sweet." Since the 14th century, people have also called each other <i>honey</i> as an affectionate nickname.</p></div></div>`;
