When she begins <i>dictation</i> make sure you write down everything she says — no doodling.</p><p class="long">If you’re a famous writer you might hire someone to take dictation so you can just speak and someone will write or type what you say. <i>Dictation</i> can describe the process of documenting spoken words, or the written words themselves. If you see an old movie with a man in a suit telling his secretary, "take this down," he's about to give dictation. A <i>dictation</i> can also be a command, like your dad's dictation that you mow the lawn.</p></div></div>`;
