var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">subtly</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The adverb <i>subtly</i> describes something that's done in a delicate or understated way. You could <i>subtly</i> suggest to your best friend that a breath mint might taste good, rather than telling her straight out that she's got terrible breath.</p><p class="long">When you do something subtly, you do it quietly and indirectly â€” like subtly criticizing your mom's choice of beachwear. If you smile subtly, it's a small, mysterious, Mona Lisa-type smile rather than a wide, open one. There are two tricks to the word <i>subtly</i>: first, when you add the <i>ly</i> to the word <i>subtle</i>, the <i>e</i> gets dropped. Second, don't confuse <i>subtly</i> with <i>subtlety</i>, a noun meaning "the state of being subtle."</p></div></div>`;
