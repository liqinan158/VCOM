This scenario is most famously described in the Bible’s Book of Revelation, but the concept is used in reference to many extreme catastrophes. For example, the devastating conditions left behind after a hurricane or tornado has hit an area can be said to be apocalyptic. Often, this adjective is used for exaggeration, so you could also use <i>apocalyptic</i> to describe the bad haircut you just got.</p></div></div>`;
