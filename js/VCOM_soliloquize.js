To <i>soliloquize</i> is to talk at length to yourself.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>soliloquize</i> comes from the noun <i>soliloquy</i>, which is a speech given by a person who has no audience — or a speech given by a character in a play who is alone on stage. When an actor soliloquizes, she tells the play's audience what she's thinking. Shakespeare's characters often soliloquize — most famously, Hamlet soliloquizes, "To be or not to be?" The word combines the Latin <i>solus</i>, "alone," and <i>loqui</i>, "speak."</p></div>`;
