The <i>faithless</i> advisor to a king might turn out to be a traitor plotting against him.</p><p class="long">If you're faithless, you're untrustworthy. You might be a faithless government worker, stealing state secrets to sell to an enemy, or a faithless boyfriend, secretly dating other people behind your girlfriend's back. The earliest meaning of <i>faithless</i> was "lacking religious faith," although it came to mean "deceptive" by the middle of the 14th century. <i>Faith</i> comes from the Latin <i>fides</i>, "trust, faith, or belief."</p></div>`;
