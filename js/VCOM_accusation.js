It is important to remember that an accusation comes about when someone thinks another person has done something wrong or committed a crime. It doesn't mean, however, that the person is guilty. There needs to be proof — an investigation or trial, even admission of guilt — before a conviction, meaning the person really is guilty.</p></div></div>`;
