A digression is like a tangent, only <i>digression</i> often describes speech patterns, whereas <i>tangent</i> comes to us from mathematics. Another trick to remembering the meaning of <i>digression</i> is its relationship to the word <i>progression</i>. A <i>pro</i>gression is a series of ideas which proceeds in the same direction; a <i>di</i>gression, logically enough, is an idea that goes off in another direction.</p></div></div>`;
