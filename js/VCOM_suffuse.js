Like tea whose flavor grows stronger the more it steeps, when you suffuse something it spreads throughout until an area is full, or even overly full. Another synonym, <i>infuse</i>, looks a lot like <i>suffuse</i>. Both words come from the Latin word <i>fundere</i>, which means "to pour."</p></div></div>`;
