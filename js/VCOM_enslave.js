The ancient Greeks were known to <i>enslave</i> groups of people they defeated in military battles.</p><p class="long">It's less common today for one group of people to enslave another, but unfortunately it does still happen. You might also encounter <i>enslave</i> being used in a figurative way, to describe something that takes over a person's freedom to make choices in some way: "Being hooked on cigarettes just <i>enslaves</i> her â€” she tries to quit, but she can't." <i>Enslave</i> comes from the "make into" prefix, <i>en-</i>, and <i>slave</i>, "person who is the property of another."</p></div></div>`;
