A fossil is an imprint of the bones of that animal in rock or stone. If you see a reconstruction of a dinosaur in a museum, scientists used fossils to figure out how it should look. Also, calling someone a <i>fossil</i> is like calling them a geezer or old fogey. It's not a compliment.</p></div></div>`;
