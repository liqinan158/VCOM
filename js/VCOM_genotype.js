As a verb, to <i>genotype</i> refers to the process of mapping the gene structure of an organism.</p><p class="long">The root word <i>gene</i> comes from the Greek <i>genea</i>, which means "generation or race." The word <i>genus</i> had been used since the 1550's as a scientific division, and in late 19th Century Germany, the word <i>genotypus</i> was coined to go along with early studies of genetics. This genetic mapping has yielded some interesting results. For example, a recent scientific study found, through <i>genotyping</i>, that the common ancestor of domestic dogs turned out to be Middle Eastern gray wolves.</p></div></div>`;
