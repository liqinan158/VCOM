If someone calls you <i>stout</i>, ask them exactly what they mean before bursting into tears and skipping dinner. It could be a compliment!</p><p class="long">Most supermodels would not want to be described as <i>stout</i>, which is often a nicer way of saying "fat." But a little teapot doesn't mind being "short and stout." Something <i>stout</i> is dependable, too, like your favorite snow boots that keep your feet dry winter after winter. Since it also means "sturdy," if you call that supermodel <i>stout</i> when he prances through the finish line of a triathlon, he'll just pump his fist in agreement.</p></div>`;
