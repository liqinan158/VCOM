Because it's an aide-memoire and not an official document, neither country is expected to be held to any agreements listed in it — it's more of an informal proposal. Groups like the World Trade Organization and the United Nations often use aide-memoirs in their interactions. <i>Aide-memoire</i> comes from the French words <i>aider</i>, "to help," and <i>mémoire</i>, "memory."</p></div></div>`;
