If a spelunker — or cave explorer — finds that a tunnel is <i>obstructed</i>, she'll turn around and crawl back the way she came.</p><p class="long">If a passageway is obstructed, you can't fit through, and if your throat is obstructed, there's a piece of food stuck there momentarily. The adjective <i>obstructed</i> shows up a lot in medical terminology, especially when the digestive or circulatory systems are unhealthily obstructed, but you can use it to simply mean "blocked." The Latin root is <i>obstructionem</i>, "a barrier or a building up."</p></div></div>`;
