A <i>chemical change</i> occurs when a new substance is formed through a chemical reaction like when fruit ripens or rots.</p><p class="long">When something undergoes a "chemical reaction" and a new substance is formed as a result, we call this <i>chemical change</i>. In some instances, simply applying heat can cause a chemical change. Cooking pancakes, for instance, is an example of a chemical change; the pancake batter "changes" from a liquid to a solid. Rust forming on metal is another example of a chemical change. The iron reacts with water and oxygen to create a new substance â€” rust.</p></div></div>`;
