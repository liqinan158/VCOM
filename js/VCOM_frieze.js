You may find a <i>frieze</i> of sculptured angels too formal for the trim of your bedroom wall.</p><p class="long">You might not think of a frieze in the same category as a painting or a statue, but it can be a true work of art. One famous frieze is painted in a large circle on the inside of the United States Capitol building; it shows famous events in American history. Another is at the Parthenon, a temple from ancient Greece. Donâ€™t confuse <i>frieze</i> with the more common term <i>freeze</i>, though they are pronounced the same way.</p></div>`;
