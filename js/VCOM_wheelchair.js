You can easily navigate sidewalks, businesses, and schools in a <i>wheelchair</i>, as long as there are  appropriate ramps and elevators available.</p><p class="long">A wheelchair is just what it sounds like: a chair with wheels. When people have injuries or conditions that don't allow them to use their legs for walking, using a wheelchair gives them a new kind of mobility. While the earliest wheelchairs had to be pushed by another person, today you can propel a wheelchair yourself, either manually, by pushing the wheels to move forward, or using electricity.</p></div></div>`;
