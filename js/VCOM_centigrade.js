The <i>centigrade</i> scale goes from zero to one hundred, where zero is the point where water freezes, and one hundred is when water boils.</p><p class="long"><i>Centigrade</i> is also called <i>Celsius</i>, but it’s never called <i>Fahrenheit</i> — because that’s a totally different measurement of temperature.  Break <i>centigrade</i> down to its Latin roots: <i>centum</i> (meaning “a hundred”) and <i>gradus</i> (meaning “steps"). There are one hundred steps in the centigrade scale, see?  There is a way to convert centigrade to Fahrenheit, but this is vocabulary not mathematics; you’re on your own with that.</p></div>`;
