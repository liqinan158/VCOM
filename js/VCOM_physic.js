An almost-synonym is "cathartic," although that word is usually used to describe an emotional purging- like a good cry- rather than physical one. Don't confuse <i>physic</i> with <i>physics</i>, the scientific study of the interaction between energy and matter, or <i>psychic</i>, someone who can read minds and see the future.</p></div></div>`;
