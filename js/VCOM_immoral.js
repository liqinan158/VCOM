When someone is immoral, they make decisions that purposely violate a moral agreement. <i>Immoral</i> is sometimes confused with <i>amoral</i>, which describes someone who has no morals and doesnâ€™t know what right or wrong means. Someone immoral, though, knows the difference and does bad stuff anyway, like that so-called friend who takes your utensils.</p></div></div>`;
