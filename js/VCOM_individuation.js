This usually refers to a psychological process described by Carl Jung. For Jung, individuation involved becoming your own person, with your own beliefs and ideals that might be separate from those of your parents and society. Individuation is a lifelong process involving all the choices that make you uniquely yourself. Individuation is also called individualization.</p></div>`;
