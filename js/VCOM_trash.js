Fittingly, the word is also a terribly derogatory term for useless, low-status people: "I should've known you were nothing but <i>trash</i>."

You can even use <i>trash</i> as a verb, to mean "throw away," as in, "I'm going to <i>trash</i> this <i>trash</i> in that <i>trash</i> can over there."</p></div>`;
