You can use <i>evidently</i> when something couldn't be more obvious, whether you're describing a driver who evidently doesn't understand that a yellow light means "slow down" and not "speed up," or a typo-riddled book that was evidently published hastily. The evidence points toward these conclusions, in other words. The Latin root is <i>evidentem</i>, "perceptible, clear, obvious, or apparent."</p></div></div>`;
