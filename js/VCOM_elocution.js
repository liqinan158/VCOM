There are even elocution coaches for actors, singers, or anyone else who wants to improve theirs. <i>Elocution</i> sometimes describes a particular style of speaking, like an announcer's elocution that sounds like he's from the Bronx. The Latin <i>elocutionem</i> is its root, meaning "manner of expression;" in Classical Latin it meant public speaking or oratory.</p></div>`;
