This means they seriously disapprove of your actions, despite the fact that you scored the winning touchdown.</p><p class="long"><i>Disapprobation</i> is a noun for the state of total disapproval and condemnation. It is often used in conjunction with a moral or social offense. Acts such as stealing an old lady's purse, defying your teachers or parents, vandalizing, or being a lying sneak are all things that are going to earn you disapprobation. But if you decide to change your evil ways and do something wonderful to earn praise, you'll find yourself back on the side of <i>approbation</i>.</p></div></div>`;
