If three people take turns writing chapters of a novel, each of them can call herself a <i>coauthor</i>.</p><p class="long">You can spell the noun <i>coauthor</i> with or without a hyphen â€” <i>co-author</i> is also correct. Whenever it takes more than one person to write a book, the book can be said to have coauthors. And if you collaborate with a friend on a hand-written magazine, you are one of its coauthors. The word comes from <i>author</i>, or writer, and the prefix <i>co</i>, which means "together" or "mutually."</p></div>`;
