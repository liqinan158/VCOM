The hero of a fairy tale is often described as <i>spunky</i>.</p><p class="long">It takes a spunky traveler to cheerfully find her way across a busy city without a map, and a spunky kindergartner might march bravely into school on the first day. Someone who's spunky isn't just courageous â€” there's an implied pep or eagerness to the word as well. The word <i>spunky</i> comes from the 1530's Scottish meaning of <i>spunk</i>, "a spark," which is rooted in the Gaelic word <i>spong</i>, "tinder, pith, or sponge."</p></div>`;
