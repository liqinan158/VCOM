They're also different from almost all other animals because male seahorses give birth to babies, after carrying eggs deposited by the female. The scientific genus of seahorses is <i>Hippocampus</i>, from the Ancient Greek words <i>hippos</i>, "horse," and <i>kampos</i>, "sea monster." There's also a section of the human brain called the <i>hippocampus</i>, named for its resemblance to the seahorse.</p></div></div>`;
