When something like a homeless shelter, prison, wind turbine, drug treatment center, or airport is proposed, a NIMBY may speak up in support of the project but object strongly to its location on his or her own street. The word <i>NIMBY</i>, or <i>nimby</i>, is an acronym for "not in my back yard," which first appeared in American English around 1980.</p></div></div>`;
