But why would someone say <i>adieu</i> instead of goodbye? Maybe they're trying to be funny in an overly formal way. Maybe they're trying to spice up their vocabulary. Or maybe they're quoting that song from <i>The Sound of Music</i>: "Adieu, adieu, to you and you and you-ooh!" Saying plain old "goodbye" can get boring, so next time try something like "adieu," "adios," "auf wiedersehen," or "sayonara."</p></div></div>`;
