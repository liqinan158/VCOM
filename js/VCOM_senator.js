In the United States, <i>senators</i> are elected by voters to represent them in a state or federal senate.</p><p class="long">Each state in the US elects two senators who serve six-year terms in Washington, DC, where they pass laws and vote on policies. Other countries have senators as well, either elected or appointed. The word <i>senator</i> has been used in English since around 1200, from the Latin word, <i>senex</i>, or "old man." This is especially appropriate when you know that men have far outnumbered women in the US senate and that the first female senator wasn't elected until 1932.</p></div></div>`;
