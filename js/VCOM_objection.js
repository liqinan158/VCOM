If someone did, that would be an objection: they think the wedding is a bad idea. In court, a lawyer says "Objection!" if they think the other lawyer said something unfair or wrong. A little kid who says "I don't want eggs!" is making an objection. Any kind of disapproval is an objection. When there are no objections, people agree.</p></div>`;
