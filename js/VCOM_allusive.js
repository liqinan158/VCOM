If you broach the subject of your friend's strange hair cut in an <i>allusive</i> way, you hint around without ever directly referring to it.</p><p class="long">Modern dances are full of allusive movements and gestures â€” they symbolize or suggest deeper meanings. Poetry is often quite allusive too, using symbols and vague impressions rather than straightforwardly addressing a topic. It's easy to confuse <i>allusive</i> with <i>elusive</i>, which is pronounced the same way but means "difficult to find or achieve."</p></div></div>`;
