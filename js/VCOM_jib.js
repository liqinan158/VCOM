The triangle-shaped <i>jib</i> hangs in front of the boat's mast.</p><p class="long">Some sailboats use only a jib to move, but most of them combine a main sail, which does most of the work, and a jib, which makes the boat more stable. <i>Jib</i> is also a verb, meaning "move to the opposite side of the ship" or "refuse to follow instructions." The old-fashioned compliment "I like the cut of your <i>jib</i>," or "I like the way you look," comes from nautical slang, in which <i>jib</i> meant "face."</p></div>`;
