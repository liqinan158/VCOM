Ever have a coworker <i>interject</i> himself into the plans for your big project at work when he wasn't really needed?</p><p class="long">First used in the late 16th century, the verb <i>interject</i> comes from the Latin word <i>interjicere</i>, which combines <i>inter-</i>, meaning "between," and <i>jacere</i>, meaning "to throw." It's most often used to describe something that's abruptly thrown into a conversion. It can be considered rude to suddenly interject a question into a conversation that doesn't involve you. But you might interject a personal story into a boring presentation to liven things up.</p></div></div>`;
