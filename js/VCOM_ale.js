In Britain, ale is considered to be any beer "other than lager, stout, or porter," while in the US ale is distinguished by the style of fermentation. The Old English origin of <i>ale</i> is <i>ealu</i>, "ale or beer." The Proto-Indo-European root has an implied meaning of "sorcery, magic, and intoxication."</p></div>`;
