The wind blows <i>loess</i> around until it settles and, over time, accumulates in one area.</p><p class="long">Where loess settles, the resulting soil tends to become very fertile, and to be distinctive for its yellowish-brown color. There are places rich in loess throughout the United States, as well as parts of China, Europe, and Argentina. There's even an area in Iowa called the "Loess Hills." The word <i>loess</i> is pronounced several ways, including "luss," and like the name <i>Lois</i>. It comes from the German <i>LÃ¶ss</i>, "yellowish-gray soil."</p></div>`;
