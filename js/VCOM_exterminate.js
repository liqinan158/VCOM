It is certainly not a pleasant process, but often quite necessary.</p><p class="long">To <i>exterminate</i> means "to kill off or destroy completely." Notice that it includes the word <i>terminate</i> which means, “to end.” It is usually used in reference to insects or rodents, but also unfortunately in reference to people or groups of people. It is just a coincidence that this verb shares a syllable with <i>termite</i> — a bug that often has to be exterminated before it eats through the wood of your home.</p></div></div>`;
