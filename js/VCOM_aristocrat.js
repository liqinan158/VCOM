Although not an <i>aristocrat</i> yourself, you may have the odd viscount on your family tree if you go back far enough.</p><p class="long">The word <i>aristocrat</i> comes from the Greek word <i>aristokratia</i>, which itself comes from the root words <i>aristos</i>, meaning "best," and <i>kratos</i>, meaning "rule." So, the <i>aristocracy</i> was the ruling class of (supposedly) the best and noblest people, and an <i>aristocrat</i> was a member of that class. Today the word can also be applied to anyone with superior standing: Count Basie was an aristocrat in the jazz world.</p></div>`;
