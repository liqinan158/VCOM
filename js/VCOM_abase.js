If you <i>abase</i> another person you are bringing them low, humbling them in a mean, <i>base</i> manner. Not nice at all.</p><p class="long"><i>Abase</i> means to bring someone down, often either in their job or their self-esteem. The early Latin <i>bassus</i>, which meant "thick, low," evolved into the Old French <i>abaissier</i>, meaning "to make lower in value or status." The important clue to the word is "base." Consider that the base of anything is the bottom, and you get an idea as to the meaning of the word <i>abase</i>, which means to make someone feel low.</p></div>`;
