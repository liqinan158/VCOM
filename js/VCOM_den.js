It’s the <i>den</i>, a secluded room or shelter.</p><p class="long"><i>Den</i> is an Old English word meaning “shelter for a wild animal.” While we still use it in this sense, the word has taken on some additional meanings. For example, <i>den</i> can refer to a room that's used primarily for relaxing, watching television, and socializing with friends. (If your friends tend to act wild at times, then perhaps this definition isn’t so far off from the original one.) <i>Den</i> can also mean "a hideout for criminals."</p></div></div>`;
