The word often refers to natural disasters, like a <i>cataclysmic</i> earthquake, but <i>cataclysmic</i> can describe other events as well as long as they’re bad enough, like the <i>cataclysmic</i> failure you had making meatloaf.</p><p class="long">Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods, tornados, landslide . . . These natural disasters are often described as cataclysmic when they cause great devastation. <i>Cataclysmic</i> isn't just for describing natural disasters — personal disasters can be called cataclysmic as well if you want to emphasize just how badly something turned out. If your meatloaf is just so-so, it’s not so disastrous. But if it’s so spectacularly bad that no one can eat it? That’s a cataclysmic failure.</p></div></div>`;
