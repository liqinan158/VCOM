If this is the case, call it <i>exploitation</i>.</p><p class="long">When youâ€™re talking about natural resources or knowledge rather than people, <i>exploitation</i> meaning "the fullest most profitable use of something" is not a bad thing. The exploitation of recycled materials can only be beneficial to our pollution problems. When people suffer under exploitation, however, it means their misfortune is being used for another's profit. Child labor, sweatshop work and debt slavery are all forms of exploitation.</p></div>`;
