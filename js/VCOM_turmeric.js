The <i>turmeric</i> used as a spice is made by grinding and drying the root of the <i>turmeric</i> plant.</p><p class="long">When a recipe calls for ground turmeric, you'll reach for a bright yellow powder with a mustard-like smell. Turmeric adds this hue to the dishes it's included in, as well as a slightly bitter flavor. It's used in a wide variety of dishes world-wide, although it's particularly common in South and East Asian foods like Indian curries, Vietnamese bánh xèo, and Thai turmeric soup. Some experts believe <i>turmeric</i> comes from the Medieval Latin <i>terra merita</i>, or "worthy earth."</p></div></div>`;
