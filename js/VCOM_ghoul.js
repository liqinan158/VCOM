On Halloween, the kids dressed as fairies and pumpkins look cute. The kids dressed as <i>ghouls</i>, with fake blood dripping down their faces and hair matted in knots? Not so cute.</p><p class="long">The word <i>ghoul</i> originates in the Arabic word “ghul,” which refers to an evil spirit that digs up graves and eats the dead. Some confuse <i>ghoul</i> with the word “gremlin,” but the two are not interchangeable. A <i>gremlin</i> does not gorge on the flesh of the dead; it is more a mischievous imp and troublemaker, famous for causing mechanical difficulties in World War II aircraft.</p></div></div>`;
