Or was there?</p><p class="long">In the 15th century, when the word <i>sinister</i> came into use in English, people who were left-handed were thought to be bad luck or even evil. In his play <i>Hamlet</i>, Shakespeare wrote of the villain holding a human skull in his sinister — i.e., left — hand. It would seem to be sinister, or wicked, enough to see a human skull in the right hand, not to mention unlucky for the person missing a head in the first place.</p></div></div>`;
