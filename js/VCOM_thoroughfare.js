When it snows, plows try to remove the snow from the <i>thoroughfares</i> so the school busses can take everyone to school. You’re welcome.</p><p class="long">This somewhat old-fashioned word has a very common meaning — a public road that goes from point A to point B. The word is made up of <i>thorough</i>, Old English for basically, “through” and <i>fare</i> for “journey.” (<i>Fare</i> also now means a payment, but not in <i>thoroughfare</i>.) If a road is private, like a driveway, it’s not a thoroughfare. This word often appears in the phrase "no <i>thoroughfare</i>," which means there isn't a public route available.</p></div>`;
