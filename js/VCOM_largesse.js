If your neighbors bring you an expensive watch from Switzerland because you fed their cat while they were traveling, thank them for their <i>largesse</i>.</p><p class="long">Though pronounced "lar JESS," the word <i>largesse</i> looks sort of like <i>largeness</i>. That's an easy way to remember what <i>largesse</i> means: think of it as largeness of spirit. <i>Largesse</i> can describe the generosity of someone giving gifts, or it can describe the gift itself. You could dispense largess by buying your brother a flashy car from your lottery winnings.</p></div>`;
