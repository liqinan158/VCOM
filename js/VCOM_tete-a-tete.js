Maybe you'll get a raise at the tete-a-tete — or maybe you're in trouble. You could schedule a tete-a-tete with your college adviser or plan to sit down with your roommate and have a tete-a-tete about the dirty dishes in the sink. The leaders of warring countries might also try to settle disputes through a tete-a-tete. In French, <i>tête-à-tête</i> literally means "head to head."</p></div></div>`;
