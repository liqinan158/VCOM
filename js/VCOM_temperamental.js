Did I say something wrong?</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>temperamental</i> can also be used to describe objects that behave unpredictably. A temperamental air conditioner can make for a long, hot summer. Fortunately, you're not temperamental or you might have smashed it to bits by now. The second “e” in <i>temperamental</i> gets swallowed so that it sounds like "temp-ra-MENT-al" (four syllables).</p></div>`;
