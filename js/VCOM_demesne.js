These days, it's more often used to mean "property" or "territory."</p><p class="long">The term <i>demesne</i> was originally used to distinguish land totally controlled by a lord from areas that were turned over to tenants. Demesne lands were often farmed and tended by serfs, with the profits or crops going to the lord and his family. <i>Demesne</i> comes from the Latin <i>dominicus</i>, "belonging to a master," and its root <i>domus</i>, "house," which it shares with <i>domicile</i>.</p></div></div>`;
