They use the word to describe not just a big rock, but a rock that some natural force — a river, a glacier or the like — has moved from its original location to its present one. A good way to remember all this is to think of Boulder, a city in Colorado that stands in the middle of the Rocky Mountains, and is, no doubt, full of boulders.</p></div></div>`;
