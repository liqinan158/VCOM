If your friend is freaking out over which poster to buy and you call her dilemma a <i>trifle</i>, you're saying she shouldn't get so worked up over nothing.</p><p class="long"><i>Trifle</i> comes from the Middle English <i>trufle</i>, meaning "fraud, joke, trick." You'll usually hear it used to mean "insignificant, trivial." If you write a little ditty to sing at a birthday party, you could say it's just a trifle. As a verb, <i>trifle</i> means "toy with, waste." If you play with someone's feelings without seriously meaning anything, you are trifling with his affection. <i>Trifle</i> is also a sweet, sticky cake. Don't trifle the day away dreaming about trifle. Make some!</p></div></div>`;
