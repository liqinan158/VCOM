If you try to make a <i>hasty</i> exit after breaking up with someone, you’ll seem like a jerk.</p><p class="long"><i>Hasty</i>, meaning “speedy, quick,” first came onto the scene in the mid 14th century. Later, it found itself paired with pudding to form <i>hasty</i> pudding, a dessert that only takes a short amount of time to make. Note that <i>hasty</i>, unlike <i>fast</i>, has negative connotations. If someone accuses you of having completed an assignment in a hasty fashion, it means your work appears careless.</p></div></div>`;
