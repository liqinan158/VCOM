Your nervy questions at a job interview might be seen as refreshingly straightforward, or simply cheeky and impudent. Sometimes <i>nervy</i> instead means "nervous," like a nervy tightrope walker who trembles and shakes with fear, but this meaning is more common in Britain than in the U.S.</p></div></div>`;
