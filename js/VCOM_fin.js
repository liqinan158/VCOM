Sharks use their dorsal <i>fins</i> to stabilize their bodies as they propel through the water.</p><p class="long">Fish, whales, dolphins, and other aquatic animals have fins on various parts of their bodies. Surfboards often have a rear fin that works in a similar way, helping to keep the board steady and aid in making turns. Ships, cars, and aircraft also have fins that assist with balance. In Old English, it was <i>finn</i>, which probably comes from the Latin <i>pinna</i>, "feather or wing."</p></div></div>`;
