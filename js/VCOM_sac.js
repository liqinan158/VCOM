While any pocket or pouch can be called a <i>sac</i>, the word usually refers to a small enclosed space that occurs in nature, like a spider's egg <i>sac</i> or a squid's ink <i>sac</i>.</p><p class="long">You might put your groceries in a sack, but without the “k” a sac is smaller and attached to a plant or animal. Human fetuses grow inside an amniotic sac, and seed plants produce pollen inside sacs as well. Since the mid-1700s, <i>sac</i> has been used to mean "biological pocket," from the Latin root word <i>saccus</i>, or "bag." If you’re not sure which <i>sac</i> to use, it’s almost always the other one unless you’re in biology class.</p></div></div>`;
