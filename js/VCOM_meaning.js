If you want to learn the <i>meaning</i> of the word <i>meaning</i>, you just need to look it up in the dictionary.</p><p class="long"><i>Meaning</i> represents something's intent or purpose. That something can be a book, a conversation, a television show, or life itself (as in, "the <i>meaning</i> of life"). When you read a poem, you try to figure out the author's intended meaning by interpreting the words he has chosen. For example, if a poet describes love as "a prison," you might interpret the meaning as his feeling confined by his love.</p></div>`;
