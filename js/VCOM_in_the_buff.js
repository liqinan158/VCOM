It comes from <i>buff</i>, which originally meant "buffalo or oxhide," and the term <i>buff-coat</i>, or leather tunic â€” before the seventeenth century, to be <i>in the buff</i> meant you were wearing such a coat. Later, the similarity of skin to the color of the leather changed the phrase's meaning to "naked."</p></div>`;
