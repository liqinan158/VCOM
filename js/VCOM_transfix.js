Your belly dancing moves might <i>transfix</i> your dance recital audience.</p><p class="long">You might describe the way the last minutes of a scary movie transfix your whole family, leaving them on the edge of their seats, or how the photographs in a gallery transfix you with their beauty. The word comes from <i>transfixus</i>, "impaled" in Latin, which in turn is rooted in <i>trans</i>, "through or across," and <i>figere</i>, "to fasten."</p></div></div>`;
