If you stay up too late watching scary movies, you might start to <i>drowse</i> the next morning in English class.</p><p class="long">You've probably found yourself beginning to drowse when you're very sleepy or bored. You'll know you're starting to drowse when your eyelids get heavy and your mind wanders. Be careful thoughâ€”if you drowse too long at the beach, you may end up with a sunburn! <i>Drowse</i> comes from the adjective <i>drowsy</i>, from an Old English root meaning "sink."</p></div></div>`;
