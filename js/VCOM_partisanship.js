A judge, for example, should be neutral and not take sides, and might be accused of partisanship if she seems to favor one cause or political party. The word comes from the early Italian <i>partezan</i> or <i>partigiano</i>, "member of a faction," with its root of <i>parte</i>, "part or party."</p></div></div>`;
