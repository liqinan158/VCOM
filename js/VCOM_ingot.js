If you find a buried treasure chest, cross your fingers that it's full of gold <i>ingots</i>!</p><p class="long">When <i>ingot</i> was originally used in the 1500s, it meant "mold in which metal is cast." To make an ingot, metal is melted and poured into such a mold, where it hardens into a bar. Ingots are used to make metal easy to transport, store, and measure â€” and sometimes to be directly traded for money, particularly in the case of gold.</p></div></div>`;
