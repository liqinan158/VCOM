Things that bubble have <i>effervescence</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Effervescence</i> derives from French. To pronounce it correctly, say "eff er VES ence." Originally it meant "the action of boiling up," but it has also come to mean "lively," such as the effervescence of someone who has energy and charisma. It is the opposite of flatness, in which things seem slow, dead, or just "off," like all the air — or energy — is gone.</p></div>`;
