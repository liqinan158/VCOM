If you <i>entrust</i> someone with the task of getting you to school on time, make sure she’s punctual.</p><p class="long">To entrust is to let someone take care of something for you because you believe she will protect it. It could be a duty or a thing — you might entrust a nursing home with the care of your parents or entrust an accountant with your finances. Entrust is a verb that needs an object, so you always entrust with or to something. If a friend entrusts you with a secret, she trusts you not to tell.</p></div>`;
