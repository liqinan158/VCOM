High school students typically have <i>lockers</i> for storing their books (and their smelly gym socks).</p><p class="long">You might use a locker at school, when you're visiting a museum and need a place to leave your backpack, or at the gym. In fact, most gyms and swimming pools have "<i>locker</i> rooms," where you can change into your workout clothes and store your regular clothes and shoes, as well as your wallet, phone, and keys, in a locker. <i>Locker</i> has been used since the 14th century â€” and even earlier, although it originally meant "a lock."</p></div></div>`;
