var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">reassign</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The verb <i>reassign</i> means to move someone or something to a new location, department, or position. If your department was in the Cincinnati office but then your boss moved you to the Chicago office, you were <i>reassigned</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Reassign</i> is a combination of <i>re-</i>, meaning "again," and <i>assign</i>, which is from the Latin word <i>assignare</i>, meaning to mark out. Today <i>reassign</i> is often used in work-related discussions to indicate a transfer. If your boss says, "I'm going to reassign you to the Peterson project," you may be flattered that your boss thinks highly enough of you to put you on such a high profile project. But when reality sets in, you realize that your boss just assigned you tons of extra work for a cranky client. Congrats!</p></div>`;
