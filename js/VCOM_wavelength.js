And, if you are on the same <i>wavelength</i> with someone else, you are in sync and share the same perspective.</p><p class="long">You can say, "My best friend and I are on the same <i>wavelength</i>," meaning you truly understand each other and tend to see the world in the same way. This meaning has been around since the 1920s, but originally <i>wavelength</i> had only its scientific definition, "the distance between two peaks of a wave." Wavelengths can be measured on anything that travels in waves, like sound, light, or water. The Old English root word is <i>wagian</i>, "to move back and forth."</p></div></div>`;
