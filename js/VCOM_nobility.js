You know the type. They hang around manors and castles, or curry favor at court.</p><p class="long">In the United states, there is no official class system, so there is no official noble class, or <i>nobility</i>.  But <i>nobility</i> is also a synonym for <i>nobleness</i> — elevation of morals, ideals, or behavior. So if you have friends who always behave with generosity, honesty, and integrity, you may be surrounded by nobility — even if you don’t hang out with lords, baronesses, dukes, or ladies.</p></div>`;
