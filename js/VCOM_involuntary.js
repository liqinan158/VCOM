If you didn’t volunteer, but you find yourself doing it anyway, it’s <i>involuntary</i>. This can go for the involuntary hiccups you wrestle with on your blind date, as well as the involuntary task you do at your manager’s insistence. <i>Involuntary</i> gets a lot of blame, but something that is involuntary is not necessarily bad: Breathing is <i>involuntary</i>, but you would probably do it anyway if given the choice.</p></div>`;
