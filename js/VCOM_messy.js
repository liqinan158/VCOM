Your <i>messy</i> room isn't bothering anyone but you — but your <i>messy</i> clothes might not be appropriate for your cousin's formal wedding.</p><p class="long">When a house is messy, it's cluttered and untidy — there might be clothes on the floor or dishes on the table and counters. A messy notebook could be jammed with papers in no particular order, and a child's messy face may very well be covered with chocolate ice cream. <i>Messy</i> dates from the 1840s, and its figurative meaning, "unethical" or "confused," like a messy divorce, came along in the 1920s.</p></div>`;
