Some people <i>pray</i> by asking for help or guidance.</p><p class="long">Most religious believers pray in one way or another â€” some pray out loud, thanking God for the things they have. Others pray silently when they're afraid or worried, or in a group of worshipers at a church or temple. You can also pray in a non-religious way, by begging for something: "I <i>pray</i> you'll really listen to my explanation." <i>Pray</i> comes from the Old French <i>preier</i>, "to pray," with its Latin root word, <i>precari</i>, "ask earnestly, beg, or entreat."</p></div></div>`;
