But <i>competent</i> on its own can sometimes be a veiled criticism, with the implication that someone competent is just going to through the motions — you'd rather have someone inspired on the job. In legal language, <i>competent</i> describes someone who has the mental capacity to take part in a trial or sign a contract.</p></div></div>`;
