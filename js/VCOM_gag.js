Cartoon bad guys often tie up their victims and put <i>gags</i> over their mouths.</p><p class="long">To use a gag for shutting someone up is to <i>gag</i> them. Both the noun and verb forms of <i>gag</i> can also be figurative: "Her government is trying to <i>gag</i> her by censoring her," or "The lack of a right to free speech in some countries is a <i>gag</i>." Another way to gag is to retch, or begin to vomit. The root of gag is probably the Old Norse <i>gag-hals</i>, "with head thrown back."</p></div></div>`;
