A few shutters and a new coat of paint won't come close to fixing that old, boarded-up house — it needs a complete <i>overhaul</i>.</p><p class="long">Back in the 1620s when the word was coined, <i>overhaul</i> described examining a fishing net to make sure there were no tears or big holes that would keep the fisherman from getting a big haul, or large amount of fish. Today, an overhaul is usually the result of such a close examination — like the overhaul that some people want to make to American public schools, or the overhaul an old car needs to keep it on the road.</p></div>`;
