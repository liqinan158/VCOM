A mugwump isn't committed to a party, candidate, or belief. Mugwumps could be in the middle of the road or just uninterested in politics. During any election, the candidates spend a lot of energy trying to get the mugwumps on their side.  If you were trying to make a decision with a group and no one would commit, you could say "Donâ€™t be a bunch of mugwumps!"</p></div></div>`;
