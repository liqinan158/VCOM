It refers to an undiagnosed mental disorder. Murderers and other dangerous people are often psychopathic. If you watch a TV show that features a character who is dangerous or even deadly, he might be psychopathic. This is a medical word, unlike "crazy," which can mean dozens of things. If you know that someone is <i>psychopathic,</i> stay away: that person is mentally ill and could hurt you.</p></div>`;
