Try adding squats and lunges to your exercise routine. Believe it or not, <i>callipygian</i> means "having a shapely rear end."</p><p class="long"><i>Callipygian</i> comes from the combination of the two ancient Greek words for "beauty" and "buttocks" and was famously used to name a statue of the Greek Goddess of Love, the so-called Aphrodite Kallipygos, who raises her robe to reveal her backside. If you're interested in learning more about Greco-Roman beauty standards, you can view a Roman copy of the statue at the National Archaeological Museum in Naples.</p></div>`;
