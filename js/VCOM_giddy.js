This adjective can mean dizzy, elated, or  — as in the spinning around example — a lightheaded, lighthearted combination of the two.</p><p class="long">The hackneyed phrase "<i>giddy</i> as a schoolgirl" calls forth the image of a kid giggling with her friends over some adolescent foolishness. <i>Giddy</i> has been used to describe someone incapable of serious thought or easily excited as far back as the 16th century. Given that, in modern usage, <i>giddy</i> describes someone silly and frivolous, it's interesting to know that the Old English source for this word has a slightly darker tinge: <i>gidig</i> means "insane" or "god-possessed."</p></div></div>`;
