You're more likely to mosey over to the book store on a Saturday than you are to mosey to work when you're running late. The verb <i>mosey</i> is early-1800's American slang with an uncertain origin. Some experts think it comes from the British slang <i>mose</i>, "to go about in a dull, stupid way," while others see a connection to the Spanish <i>vamos</i>, or "let us go."</p></div></div>`;
