And odds are you're not invited to too many parties.</p><p class="long">Someone who is <i>fractious</i> is cranky, rebellious and inclined to cause problems. Tempers and children are commonly described as such. In <i>To Kill A Mockingbird</i>, author Harper Lee uses the word to describe the trouble-making Calpurnia: "She had always been too hard on me, she had at last seen the error of her <i>fractious</i> ways, she was sorry and too stubborn to say so."</p></div>`;
