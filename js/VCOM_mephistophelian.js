For example, the supervillain known as The Joker has a particularly <i>mephistophelian</i> laugh.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>mephistophelian</i> is a great way to describe an evil genius or a clever, wicked person. The word comes from a demonic character in German folklore, Mephistopheles, whose name stems from <i>mephitz</i>, "destroyer" in Hebrew, and <i>tophel</i>, "liar." Your little brother might look mephistophelian in his Halloween devil costume, and you could even describe a perfectly nice man with a pointy beard as mephistophelian.</p></div></div>`;
