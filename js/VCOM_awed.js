The first time kids see a fireworks display, they're often <i>awed</i> by it.</p><p class="long">The first time you visit a big city, you might wander around looking up at the skyscrapers with an awed expression on your face. When you're awed, you're full of wonder that's tinged with fear or confusion. It's generally big, impressive things that leave you awed. A new father holding his baby might be awed, for example. <i>Awed</i> comes from <i>awe</i>, "amazement," which has a Scandinavian root and is related to the Old Norse word <i>agi</i>, or "fright."</p></div>`;
