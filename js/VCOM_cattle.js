If you have a small dairy farm with only three or four cows, you'll probably call them "cows." When you're talking about a bigger operation, they're more likely to be called <i>cattle</i>. In the 13th century, the word simply meant "property," from the Medieval Latin <i>capitale</i>, "property or stock." It took about 300 years before <i>cattle</i> meant "cows."</p></div>`;
