As you can imagine, <i>permafrost</i> is extremely cold.</p><p class="long">If you know that <i>frost</i> has many cold-related meanings and <i>permanent</i> means "always," then you should be able to figure out what permafrost is: ground that is permanently frozen. You won't be able to plant a garden in permafrost — or do much with it — since it’s so hard and cold. You won't find permafrost in warm climates or places that have distinct seasons. Permafrost only exists in areas where it's cold all the time, so the ground never thaws out.</p></div></div>`;
