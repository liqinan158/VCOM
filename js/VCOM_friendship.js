A good job, good health, and romantic love are important, but without real <i>friendship</i>, your life might not feel full.</p><p class="long">When we talk about <i>friendship</i>, we're often talking about the value of having friends, not just the fact of it. A book might explore the importance of friendship in a young girl's life. You might decide to stop working such long hours and spend more time developing your friendships, in an effort to lead a happier life. A deep friendship can last through many shifts and changes in life, as long as you write or call every now and then.</p></div></div>`;
