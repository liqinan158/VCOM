For example, a grandmother and her grandson are <i>consanguine</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Consanguine</i> is a fancy way to say "related." People who are connected through marriage or adoption are not consanguine, because they aren't genetically related to each other, but mothers and children, uncles and  nephews, and brothers and sisters are all consanguine. A more common word with the same meaning is <i>consanguineous</i>, and both words come from the Latin <i>consanguineus</i>, which means "of the same blood."</p></div>`;
