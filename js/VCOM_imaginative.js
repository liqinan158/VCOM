If you enjoy coming up with stories, writing songs, or just thinking about things in new ways, you’re an <i>imaginative</i> person.</p><p class="long">Great painters, musicians, and writers are imaginative.  However, being imaginative isn’t just limited to the arts. When you're imaginative, you can develop a unique solution to a problem or issue. For example, an imaginative engineer might develop a new, more efficient way to construct a bridge. An idea or object that’s fresh and original — like that bridge the engineer designed — can also be described as imaginative.</p></div></div>`;
