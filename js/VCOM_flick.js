There used to be a "<i>Flick a Bic</i>" cigarette ad: cigarettes are awful, but starting a lighter is a classic <i>flick</i>.</p><p class="long">The most common flick is probably turning a switch on or off — people flick switches, like light switches. <i>Flicking</i> is also used when describing golfers and basketball players. A fast, sharp golf shot could be called a <i>flick.</i> A quick basketball shot — like tipping the ball in with one second left in the game — is also a <i>flick</i>. A <i>flick</i> can also be described as a quick jerk — not a jerk as in a bad person, but a tiny movement. If you're using your whole body or even your whole arm, you're not flicking.</p></div></div>`;
