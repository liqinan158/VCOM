You can also use <i>caring</i> (as an adjective) to describe a person who acts in this warm and fuzzy way.</p><p class="long">There's a reason for the saying "<i>caring</i> is sharing." You and your best buddy might exhibit caring, or affection, by sharing secrets, hugs, and the contents of your lunch boxes. <i>Caring</i> can also be an adjective. Caring nurses, parents, and teachers are great "caregivers" because they dole out warm fuzziness all day long. Well, at least sometimes.</p></div></div>`;
