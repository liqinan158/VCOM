After you sail around the world for seven years, fighting corruption and planting vegetable gardens, some poet will surely write the <i>epic</i> of your adventures.</p><p class="long"><i>Epic</i> comes from the Greek word for song, because Greek poets like Homer sang their poems. We tend to use <i>epic</i> for long, ambitious novels or movies, especially if they involve a long journey. <i>Epic</i> can be used as an adjective to describe something historically important, lasting and complex. Perhaps your great-grandfather was a soldier in the epic struggle of World War One. Your three day, sleepless card poker game could be described as epic.</p></div>`;
