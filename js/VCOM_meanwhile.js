For example, you might have a great evening at the bowling alley, but <i>meanwhile</i>, your parents are home wondering why you never showed up for dinner.</p><p class="long">The word <i>meanwhile</i> is handy when you’re telling a story because sometimes it’s funny to realize what two things are happening at the same time. You might be frantically searching for your cat, meanwhile, he's lounging under your bed. <i>Meanwhile</i> can also refer to the time before something happens, as in "I have an interview in an hour, but <i>meanwhile</i> I'm going to take a nap." The word <i>meanwhile</i> is rooted in <i>mean</i>, with its meaning of "middle" or "intermediate."</p></div>`;
