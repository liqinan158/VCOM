When a guard runs after an escaping jewel thief, she's in <i>pursuit</i> — while the thief may have stolen the jewels because he was in <i>pursuit</i> of wealth.</p><p class="long">Whether it's a police officer in a car chase or a student working towards a college degree at a university in the tropics, both can be considered in “hot <i>pursuit</i>.”  Derived from the Anglo-French <i>purseute</i>, <i>pursuit</i> means the act of pursuing or striving towards goals. In the late 14th century it implied <i>persecution</i>, but things have changed since then.</p></div>`;
