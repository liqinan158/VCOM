He must be very slick and tricky to have convinced you to buy a set of new tires, considering you don't have a car.</p><p class="long">How can you remember the meaning of the adjective <i>wily</i>? Just think about the old Warner Brothers Looney Tunes cartoons. Their aptly named cartoon character, Wile E. Coyote, got his name from a clever play on words. Wile E. is supposed to be cunning, crafty, and clever â€” in other words, wily. Wile E. is all those things, but unfortunately he was usually bested by that pesky roadrunner anyway. Meep. Meep.</p></div></div>`;
