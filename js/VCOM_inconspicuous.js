The bad news? You just got pizza sauce on your shirt. The good news? It landed in an <i>inconspicuous</i> spot, so no one will notice.</p><p class="long"><i>Inconspicuous</i> comes from the Latin word <i>inconspicuus</i>, or "not visible," and the original meaning of <i>inconspicuous</i> was "invisible," until around 1828. Today, it describes anything that blends in or isn't very noticeable.
