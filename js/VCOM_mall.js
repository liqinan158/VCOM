If you want to spend your day buying clothes and eating in a food court, the <i>mall</i> is the place for you.</p><p class="long">Indoor malls are commonly several stories high, the different levels connected with escalators. There can be dozens or even hundreds of stores inside a mall, along with places to eat, drink, and rest, and often to watch movies, play video games, or even ride on a carousel. Outdoor malls are either organized like old-fashioned downtown areas, with trees and sidewalks, or just a row of shops with a large parking lot â€” also called a "strip <i>mall</i>."</p></div></div>`;
