Your math class. Your sister's violin recital. A babysitting job where five kids are going through your purse and the parents didn't leave a number.</p><p class="long">Something that is <i>interminable</i> is often boring, annoying, or hard to bear, such as an <i>interminable</i> noise. A near synonym is <i>incessant,</i> which also refers to something unpleasant that continues without stopping. It descends from the Latin prefix <i>in-</i> "not," <i>terminare </i>"to end," and the suffix <i>-abilis</i> "able to." Latin <i>terminare</i> is also the source of the English verb <i>terminate</i> "to end" and the corresponding noun <i>termination</i> "an act of ending something."</p></div>`;
