The band director may show <i>patient</i> leadership, but a football coach uses other methods with his team.</p><p class="long">It may be difficult to wait for something that takes a long time or deal with someone who is annoying, but if you are patient, you endure these things calmly and without frustration. Endure is the keyword here as <i>patient</i> comes from the Latin verb <i>pati</i> "to suffer, endure." Think of the patient way a chess player wins a game â€” calmly, steadily and willing to wait for the right time to act.</p></div>`;
