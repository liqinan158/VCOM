You can use the word to describe the endless war between fans of the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees.</p><p class="long"><i>Fanaticism</i> come from the Latin word <i>fanaticus</i>, a word with a meaning that includes the word <i>mad</i> — in both senses. If you're mad, you might be angry — or you might be insane. Fanaticism involves both kinds of madness. Anger at those who disagree with you, taken so far that there's a desire to stop or even harm the dissenters? That's madness — and also fanaticism.</p></div></div>`;
