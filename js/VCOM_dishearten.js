Something that brings you down or steals your sense of hope <i>disheartens</i> you.</p><p class="long">Uncracking the code of the verb <i>dishearten</i> couldn't be easier. Just take it apart, and it quickly reveals its meaning. <i>Dis-</i> is a prefix that means "not, un-, take away." <i>Heart</i> in its figurative sense means love, care, and good feelings. And the <i>-en</i> at the end shows the word is a verb with the sense of causing something to be. So <i>dishearten</i> means "to cause someone's 'heart' to be taken away." We were disheartened by the news of still more home foreclosures.</p></div></div>`;
