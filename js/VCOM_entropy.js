It usually refers to the idea that everything in the universe eventually moves from order to disorder, and <i>entropy</i> is the measurement of that change.</p><p class="long">The word <i>entropy</i> finds its roots in the Greek <i>entropia</i>, which means "a turning toward" or "transformation." The word was used to describe the measurement of disorder by the German physicist Rudolph Clausius and appeared in English in 1868. A common example of <i>entropy</i> is that of ice melting in water. The resulting change from formed to free, from ordered to disordered increases the entropy.</p></div></div>`;
