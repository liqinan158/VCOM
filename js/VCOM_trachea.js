You can't breathe without your <i>trachea</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>trachea</i> is from the Greek phrase for windpipe â€” <i>trakheia arteria</i>, which literally meant "rough artery." The trachea is formed from rings of cartilage, which give the trachea its rough appearance. If you can't breathe, you may need a tracheotomy, which is a procedure in which the doctor makes an incision and then places a tube in your trachea below the obstruction so you can still take air into your lungs.</p></div>`;
