People use the same word to describe a hankering for a snack or for the more dire meaning of starvation, as in "world <i>hunger</i>."</p><p class="long"><i>Hunger</i> sometimes refers to an extreme lack of food, the equivalent to starvation: "We need to do something about <i>hunger</i> in poor communities." It can also simply mean your afternoon craving: "My daily <i>hunger</i> for chocolate was distracting me from my work." You can also <i>hunger</i> for things, both food (like when you hunger for French fries) and non-food things (like when you hunger for attention).</p></div>`;
