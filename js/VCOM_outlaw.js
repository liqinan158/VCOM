Historically, the word <i>outlaw</i> was used for Western criminals like Billy the Kid or Jesse James, not so much for contemporary drug lords or serial killers.</p><p class="long">Because they didn't need to be arrested by a police officer or other official, pursuing outlaws was once a way to earn reward money. The outlaw figure became popular due to the almost romantic image of nonconformity they had â€” outlaws are common characters in Western books and movies. You can also use <i>outlaw</i> to mean "ban or make illegal." If you had your way, you might outlaw spinach, long lines, and stinky perfume.</p></div></div>`;
