If you traveled to Tibet, you might see a yak <i>shepherd</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Shepherd</i> comes from the Old English <i>sceaphierde</i>: sheepherder. Such a person protects sheep from animals that would attack them, keeps them from wandering, and otherwise takes care of the flock. The word is also a verb that describes care of a group â€” sheep, other animals, even people. You might shepherd your herd of goats, or shepherd your younger siblings through the transition from elementary to middle school.</p></div></div>`;
