The U.S. has <i>free trade</i> agreements with many other countries to make buying and selling easier.</p><p class="long">In its purest form, free trade places no taxes or tariffs on any imported or exported goods. While most politicians in the United States support free trade to some extent, there are many restrictions and regulations in place that affect buying and selling between countries. Proponents of free trade claim that it helps the economy and costs consumers less, while opponents note that a lack of regulations can hurt the environment and workers.</p></div></div>`;
