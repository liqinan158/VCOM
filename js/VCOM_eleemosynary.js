Monetary donations to <i>eleemosynary</i> institutions are usually tax deductible.</p><p class="long"><i>Eleemosynary</i> comes from the Latin word <i>eleemosyna</i>, which means alms, the historic term for money or food given to the poor. <i>Eleemosyna</i> is rooted in the Greek word <i>eleos</i>, meaning mercy. You can use the word <i>eleemosynary</i> today when you mean pertaining to or dependent on charitable giving. If you say, "<i>Eleemosynary</i> contributions commence with one's own domicile," then you've found a verbose way to say, "Charity begins at home."</p></div>`;
