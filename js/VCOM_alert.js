In all parts of speech, <i>alert</i> implies preparedness. The word is derived from the French <i>a l'erte</i> which translates to "on the watch." When you hear the word, imagine an alarm going off. The alarm is the alert. When you hear it, you have been alerted and you are now alert.</p></div></div>`;
