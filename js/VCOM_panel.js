It can mean “jury,” as above, and can also refer to a flat piece of a hard surface, often rectangular, such as the wood panel of a door or wall. <i>Panel</i> is also a verb meaning "to install panels." Finally, a control panel has a lot of switches and is a way to make some machines work.</p></div></div>`;
