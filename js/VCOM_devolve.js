Well, life is complicated, and sometimes things <i>devolve</i> instead â€” to <i>devolve</i> is to get worse instead of better.</p><p class="long">The <i>de-</i> in <i>devolve</i> is a clue to its meaning. When things devolve, they deteriorate, degenerate, fall apart, go to the dogs, and generally end up worse. When a classroom gets loud and rowdy, a teacher might say the class has devolved. There is another, less negative, meaning of <i>devolve</i>. You can devolve responsibilities: for example, the U.S. government could devolve a certain responsibility to the states. The non-negative meaning of <i>devolve</i> is kind of like passing things on in a will. If I devolve something to you, you inherit it.</p></div></div>`;
