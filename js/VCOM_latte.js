Many <i>lattes</i> have delicate patterns or pictures drawn in the creamy foam on top.</p><p class="long">The full name of a latte is "caffe <i>latte</i>," which means "milk coffee" in Italian. Other countries have variations on this idea, from France's "café au lait" to Germany's "Milchkaffee." While <i>Caffè latte</i> was used in Italy for milky coffee drinks made in people's homes, it wasn't found until very recently on cafe menus — the latte is more of an American invention. If you order a latte in Italy, in fact, what you'll get is a glass of milk.</p></div></div>`;
