At an oil <i>refinery</i>, crude oil is treated and made into gasoline and other petroleum products.</p><p class="long">Whenever a material needs to have unwanted parts removed in order to be made into a useable product, it must be <i>refined</i> â€” clarified or processed. This is done at a plant called a <i>refinery</i>. A sugar refinery, for example, converts sugar cane or beets into familiar white, refined crystals of sugar. <i>Refinery</i> comes from <i>refine</i>, which is rooted in the now-obsolete verb <i>fine</i>, "make fine."</p></div>`;
