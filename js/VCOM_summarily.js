A strict babysitter might announce, "Bedtime!" and <i>summarily</i> flip off the lights and close the bedroom door.</p><p class="long">The adverb <i>summarily</i> describes things that are done in an abrupt, brief way, without any extra details. It's kind to explain to a job applicant why you're not hiring them, rather than summarily saying, "There's the door, goodbye." A related word is <i>summary</i>, meaning "brief," or "containing just the sum or substance." The Latin root, <i>summa</i>, means "whole or gist."</p></div></div>`;
