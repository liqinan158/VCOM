Some east coast beaches are covered with small stones, shells, and <i>periwinkles</i>. Itâ€™s also a color, a purplish-blue, just like the flowers on a <i>periwinkle</i> plant.</p><p class="long">You might see periwinkles as you walk along the sea shore, and you may even see them on some restaurant menus, especially in coastal areas of the UK, where they're commonly called <i>winkles</i>. Another kind of periwinkle is the blue-flowered plant also called <i>vinca</i>, as well as the shade of purplish blue that was named for the flowers. <i>Periwinkle</i> is fun to say.</p></div>`;
