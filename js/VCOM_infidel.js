How can you call people <i>infidels</i> and expect them to believe your religion is tolerant?</p><p class="long"><i>Infidel</i> comes to English from the Latin <i>infidelis</i>, which means "unfaithful," although it's almost always hurled at a person of different faith.  You can also use the word more lightly to mean someone who doesn't share a common belief or opinion.  Cries of "Infidel!" could be heard throughout the dorm when you announced that you didn't root for the local football team.</p></div>`;
