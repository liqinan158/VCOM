Give it a try!</p><p class="long"><i>Cavorting</i> requires a good mood, lots of energy, and some running room. Children love to <i>cavort</i>, and so do parents when they win the lottery. The origins of the word are unclear, perhaps coming from the word <i>curvet</i>, meaning “leap gracefully or energetically,” and leaping is a great addition to any cavorting. There are lots of synonyms, so if you ever get tired of cavorting, you could always <i>prance, frolic, lark, rollick, romp</i>, or <i>carouse</i>. The choice is yours.</p></div>`;
