It's easy to identify a male cardinal by its bright red color and the tufted <i>crest</i> on its head.</p><p class="long">The Latin word <i>crista</i>, which <i>crest</i> comes from, means "tuft or comb." An animal's crest can be feathers, fur, skin, or a comb like a rooster's. Something that resembles such a feature can also be called a crest, such as a plume on an old-fashioned helmet. The top or highest part of something is also a crest, like the crest of a hill or the crest of a wave. As a verb, <i>crest</i> means "to reach the top" like when you crest a mountain.</p></div></div>`;
