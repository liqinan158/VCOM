Some families <i>hug</i> each other all the time, while others save their <i>hugs</i> for special occasions.</p><p class="long">Celebrate National Hug Your Cat Day if you want to, but your cat may be less enthusiastic about it than you are. <i>Hug</i> is both a verb and a noun: when you hug your cat, she gets a hug. You can also hug your knees, holding them close to your body, and your skinny jeans can be said to hug your legs, or fit tightly. <i>Hug</i> probably comes from the Old Norse <i>hugga</i>, "to comfort."</p></div></div>`;
