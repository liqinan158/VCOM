You might also say someone looks youthful if they appear younger than they are. Someone who acts youthful might enjoy swinging on the swings at the playground, even if they're no longer a kid. At the heart of <i>youthful</i> is <i>youth</i>, "the period between childhood and adulthood."</p></div>`;
