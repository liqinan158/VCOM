In a marching band, the <i>tuba</i> player plays the lowest, deepest notes (and also has to lug around her <i>tuba</i>).</p><p class="long">The tuba is the biggest, and among the newest, of all the brass instruments. Tuba players create the low-pitched sound by making a kind of "buzz" with their breath against the mouthpiece and pressing the tuba's valves to form notes. In an orchestra, a tuba player holds the instrument on her lap, while a tuba player in a marching band would use a sousaphone tuba, or <i>helicon</i>, a lighter tuba that can be worn across a shoulder.</p></div></div>`;
