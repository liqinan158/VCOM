That is, <i>latent</i> means something that is capable of becoming active or at hand but has not yet achieved that state. The word arrived in Middle English from the Latin word <i>latÄ“re</i> which means "to lie hidden." It can have somewhat negative connotations because it is often used in a medical context, as in a <i>latent</i> illness or infection, but it can also mean good things, such as someone discovering they have <i>latent</i> talents or capabilities.</p></div></div>`;
