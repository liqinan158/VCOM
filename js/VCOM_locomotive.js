It's most common to see a <i>locomotive</i> at the front or back of the train—and sometimes both.</p><p class="long">On a freight train, every single car is loaded with cargo that's being transported—like grain, steel, coal, or lumber—except for the locomotive. Its only job is to power the entire train, either pulling it, or pushing it from the rear. As an adjective, <i>locomotive</i> means "relating to movement," like the locomotive power of a vehicle. This word comes from the Latin roots <i>loco</i>, "from a place," and <i>motivus</i>, "moving."</p></div></div>`;
