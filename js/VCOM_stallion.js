While in most of the western world stallions are primarily kept for breeding, it is popular in parts of the Middle East and Asia for stallions to be used for riding (almost always by men). The word <i>stallion</i> comes from <i>stall</i>, referencing ancient laws requiring male breeding horses to be kept in stalls rather than allowed to wander in fields.</p></div>`;
