The verb "get" is a good example of <i>polysemy</i> — it can mean "procure," "become," or "understand."</p><p class="long">One of the concepts used by linguists (people who study the way languages work) is <i>polysemy</i> — it's an ambiguous quality that many words and phrases in English share. Generally, polysemy is distinguished from simple homonyms (where words sound alike but have different meanings) by etymology. Polysemous words almost always share the same origin or root. Speaking of etymology, <i>polysemy</i> comes from Greek, in which it means "of many senses."</p></div>`;
