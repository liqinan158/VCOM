You might be rendered <i>speechless</i> if you win the lottery or find a whale on your front lawn.</p><p class="long">When you’re speechless, you’re at a loss for words. For example, people often say things like "I was <i>speechless</i> when I received the news about my brother!" or "The music left me <i>speechless</i>!" It’s an exaggeration. People use <i>speechless</i> in these cases to show how stunned or moved they were, even though they were probably still capable of speech. "I'm <i>speechless</i>" often really means "I'm shocked!"</p></div>`;
