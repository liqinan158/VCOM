When you're training your dog, the treats in your pocket can be used as <i>motivational</i> tools.</p><p class="long">If someone gives a motivational speech, their purpose is to try to get people excited about doing or trying something. A football coach's motivational talk to his team, for example, is intended to inspire the players to win the game. In other words, what the coach says <i>motivates</i> the team to play well. Both <i>motivate</i> and <i>motivational</i> come from the Old French <i>motif</i>, "drive or motivation," from <i>motivus</i>, "moving" in Medieval Latin.</p></div></div>`;
