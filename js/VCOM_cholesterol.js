It's important for healthy cell membranes and other functions, but its waxy makeup makes it a danger as a high concentration could build up and block arteries.</p><p class="long">Cholesterol is a product of the liver, excreted through bile into the digestive tract. The first notice of cholesterol was in 1769, when a French researcher found it in gallstones. Then, in the early 19th Century the chemical was named "cholestrine," from the Greek words for bile (<i>chole</i>) and solids (<i>stereos</i>), plus the chemical suffix <i>-ol</i>. Scientists have noted the role of cholesterol in heart attacks and other health problems, a situation that can be regulated through diet or medications.</p></div></div>`;
