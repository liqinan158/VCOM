A <i>tracheal</i> obstruction makes it hard to breathe.</p><p class="long">All tracheal things relate to the tube that connects your larynx to your two primary bronchi, just before your lungs. When doctors need to intervene to help a patient breathe, they'll frequently do a tracheal intubation, inserting a tube into the trachea to keep the airway open. The Greek root of <i>tracheal</i> is <i>trakheia</i>, "rough," which describes the cartilage rings that form the trachea.</p></div>`;
