A patient undergoing surgery will often have a <i>cannula</i> inserted into a vein so that anesthesia can be administered.</p><p class="long">If you've ever had an IV in a hospital or doctor's office, you've had a cannula, which is nothing more than the flexible tube that fluids or medication flows through. Donating blood or having a blood test involves cannulas as well â€” in this case, a small amount of blood flows from your vein into the cannula. This is a Latin word that means "small reed or pipe," from <i>canna</i>, "reed or pipe."</p></div></div>`;
