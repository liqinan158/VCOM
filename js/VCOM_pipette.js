If you were examining a chemical under your microscope, you'd use a <i>pipette</i> to put a drop on your slide.</p><p class="long">Some pipettes are used for measuring small amounts of liquid, but the most common use is transporting them from one place to another. When you squeeze a small bulb attached to the pipette, the vacuum you've created sucks fluid up into the slender glass instrument. Think of an eye dropper, the most commonly-used type of pipette. The word comes from Middle French, in which it means "tube."</p></div></div>`;
