var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">aficionado</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If you really like something and make it your business to study up on its history and characteristics, you could be called an <i>aficionado</i> of that subject.</p><p class="long">This sort of funny-looking word might seem like it needs a second “f,” but it really doesn’t, and you should hold out on the temptation to add another one. (The single “f” spelling is a result of the word’s Spanish heritage.) The word <i>aficionado</i> implies serious study and fervent interest — it’s often applied to lovers of wine, known as wine <i>aficionados</i> — but you can think of it as just a fancy way to say <i>fan</i>. You could call yourself a football <i>aficionado</i>, for example, if you think that sounds more impressive than just saying you’re a football fan. (Though that might get you beat up in certain bars.)</p></div>`;
