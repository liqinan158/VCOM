When a strip of grass divides one direction of a highway from another, it's called a <i>median</i> because it runs through the middle.</p><p class="long"><i>Median</i> comes from the Latin word <i>medius</i>, which also means middle. In math, the <i>median</i> is a number in the middle of a list. In the set 2, 3, 5, 10, 25, the median is 5. The statistical median is often linked to the idea of an average. A town's average income might seem high if there are two extremely rich people who live there. The median will tell you the income of the person halfway through the list.</p></div></div>`;
