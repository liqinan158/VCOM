It can also refer to a particular person or thing. You can use it avoid explaining something unnecessarily â€” you might say, "There are certain things I want to do when I get home." To avoid saying someone's name, you can say, "a certain person," as in, "A certain person left the kitchen a mess."</p></div></div>`;
