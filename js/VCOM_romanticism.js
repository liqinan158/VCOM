Highly-charged situations of love and loss allow you to escape reality for a little while.</p><p class="long">The suffix <i>ism</i> indicates a condition, so <i>romanticism</i> is the condition of being romantic, or yearning for the imaginative and adventurous.  The word originally meant "of the Roman style," and referred to using Romance languages rather than the Frankish, or Germanic. It then came to mean Medieval tales of knightly chivalry, and later included love stories. In the late 18th Century, Romanticism became a major artistic movement, infusing art, music, and literature with the emotional cores of adventure and love.</p></div>`;
