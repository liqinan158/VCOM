In developed countries, tap water is usually <i>potable</i>. Puddle water is not.  I know you want to take a sip of that puddle water, but please, restrain yourself.</p><p class="long"><i>Potable</i> can also be a noun, meaning any drinkable liquid.  The word comes from the Latin <i>potare</i>, meaning "to drink."   Not only did the Romans come up with that word; they built some of the world's first aqueducts, above-ground channels that brought potable water from the mountains to the cities.  Potable water is often in short supply after natural catastrophes like earthquakes and hurricanes, and its availability is often discussed on the news.</p></div>`;
