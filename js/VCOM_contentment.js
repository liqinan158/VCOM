On Thanksgiving when you think about all you are grateful for, hopefully you feel a sense of <i>contentment</i>. If not, have another piece of pie and then you’ll feel <i>contentment</i>.</p><p class="long">Contentment isn’t an excited kind of happy, it’s more like a peaceful ease of mind. It’s being satisfied with what you have, whatever that is. You might feel a sense of contentment knowing you have a cup of hot chocolate and a good movie to look forward to tonight. Or you might experience contentment thinking about the vast estate you just purchased in the Hamptons. Whatever is going on in your life, you’re pleased about it.</p></div></div>`;
