Lately, though, <i>diva</i> has come to describe someone that's acting entitled or holier than thou. A person who acts like the world revolves around her is a <i>diva</i>. If you walk into a packed restaurant and demand the best table snapping, "Don't you know who I am?", well, that's <i>diva</i> behavior.</p></div>`;
