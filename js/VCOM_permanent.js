Think twice about writing in <i>permanent</i> marker or getting a tattoo — both are just about impossible to erase.</p><p class="long">If you wait around for something permanent to change, you'll be there for a long time — maybe forever. That's because the adjective <i>permanent</i> is used to describe something that continues on into the foreseeable future without shifting, moving, or changing at all. You might also come across the noun <i>permanent</i>, which refers to a chemical treatment used to curl your hair. But please know that "perms" aren't really cool anymore.</p></div></div>`;
