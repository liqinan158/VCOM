You can <i>deny</i> your sweet tooth all you want, but the stash of candy in your desk tells a different story.</p><p class="long">It's hard to deny what etymologists have proven: <i>deny</i> is rooted in the Latin word <i>denegare</i>, which means “to deny, reject, refuse.” You can deny yourself of chocolate if you're on a diet, or deny the accusations that you're a chocoholic. But it's usually best to fess up. Abraham Lincoln famously admitted: “I never did like to work, and I don't deny it. I'd rather read, tell stories, crack jokes, talk, laugh — anything but work."</p></div></div>`;
