When you make a reverent journey to a place you consider sacred, you're a <i>pilgrim</i>.</p><p class="long">You can also use the word less seriously and call yourself a pilgrim when you make the trip to Graceland for Elvis Week.  Another kind of pilgrim (often spelled with a capital P) are the Puritans who fled religious persecution in Europe, came over on the Mayflower, and founded Plymouth Colony, in Massachusetts. The word comes from the Latin <i>peregrinus,</i> "foreign," or "a foreigner," and if you just travel to foreign countries, youâ€™re a pilgrim, too.</p></div></div>`;
