Learning about the <i>plight</i> of people trying to rebuild their homes after a devastating earthquake might inspire you to send money to a charity.</p><p class="long"><i>Plight</i> means predicament. It comes from the word for <i>pleat</i>, which means fold. A plight is a tough bind. You'll usually hear the word <i>plight</i> for groups of people or animals struggling to survive, or struggling for better lives. We talk about the plight of refugees, or the plight of sea birds after an oil spill. An old-fashioned use of <i>plight</i> is for pledge. If you get engaged, you give a plight of your love.</p></div>`;
