var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">retard</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>retard</i> something is to slow it down. A lack of fresh fruit and vegetables can <i>retard</i> the growth of a young child.</p><p class="long">This word should be used with a lot of caution. Calling someone who's mentally retarded — or of low intelligence — a <i>retard</i> is considered very offensive by many people. That use should be avoided. On the other hand, this is a harmless word when used as a verb. While skiing, a heavy, bulky jacket could retard your progress down the mountain. Keeping a plant out of sunlight would retard its growth. When you see <i>retard</i>, think <i>slow</i> and "Use with caution."</p></div></div>`;
