If you ask people if they've ever cheated on a test, you may get <i>revealing</i> answers that tell you whether the person is honest or not.</p><p class="long"><i>Revealing</i> comes from the Latin word <i>revelare</i>, which literally means "unveil," and that word has its roots in <i>re-</i>, meaning "the opposite of," and <i>velare</i> meaning "to cover or veil." It is little wonder that the adjective <i>revealing</i> is often used to describe clothing that leaves little to the imagination. If your daughter's date comes to the door in a revealing shirt with almost every button undone, you might ask him to put on a jacket or else he'll be sure to catch cold.</p></div>`;
