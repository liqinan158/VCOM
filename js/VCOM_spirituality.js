You might say, "I'm not religious; but I have a strong sense of spirituality," which might mean that you practice yoga or meditation, or you pray with a group, or you nurture your spirit by spending time in nature. Religions usually have defined beliefs, rituals, and guidelines; spirituality is more individual.</p></div></div>`;
