If you are trying to prove a point, and you want your argument to have a sense of authority, you might want to use a <i>statistic</i> to back up your claim.</p><p class="long">A statistic is a single piece of information represented by a number. “Water makes up 70% of the Earth’s surface,” for instance, is a statistic. A statistic is like a fact that is reached through a mathematical process. A population figure is the most common statistic you will encounter.
