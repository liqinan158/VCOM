But irony isn’t exactly untruthful — it's just not what you expect. Your mother sent you off to camp so you could become a champion tennis player, but, ironically, you broke your leg the first day and spent the summer playing bridge instead. You didn’t get what you (or your mother) expected.</p></div>`;
