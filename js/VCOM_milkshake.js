If you want a dessert you can slurp through a straw, you should consider a <i>milkshake</i>.</p><p class="long">Milkshakes are traditionally made with ice cream, milk, and flavored syrups like chocolate or strawberry, although there are infinite variations. You might prefer frozen yogurt or non-dairy ice cream, or an extra-thick milkshake made without milk. In New England, this sweet treat is often called a "frappe," although if it's coffee-flavored and you're in Rhode Island, it's a "coffee cabinet." <i>Milkshake</i> was first used in the 1880s, when it referred to an adult beverage made with whiskey.</p></div>`;
