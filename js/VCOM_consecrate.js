var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">consecrate</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Consecrate</i> means to make holy or to dedicate to a higher purpose. You need to <i>consecrate</i> a building to turn it into a church, but you can also <i>consecrate</i> a week in New York City to the pursuit of the perfect bagel.</p><p class="long">The <i>secr</i> part of <i>consecrate</i> comes from the Latin <i>sacer</i> "sacred." Remember that something consecrated is dedicated to God and thus sacred. And then remember that the meanings of words tend to stretch; over time this one moved from "dedicated to God" to "dedicated to whatever": jelly donuts, the perfect tan, finding a solution to Rubik's Cube.</p></div></div>`;
