A <i>railroad</i> is made up of the actual tracks, crossings, and stations, as well as the people who keep the trains running and scream, "All aboard!"</p><p class="long">If you prefer traveling by railroad, you like to ride trains, whether to the next town over or all the way across the country. Many railroad tracks in the US are used for freight trains that deliver goods around the country. When <i>railroad</i> is a verb, it can mean "move by train," but it's more likely to mean "force or coerce someone to do something," like when you railroad your brother into taking out the trash for you.</p></div></div>`;
