You could consider most eulogies as <i>panegyrics</i>.</p><p class="long">It stands to reason that the original use of the word <i>panegyris</i>, from which <i>panegyric</i> derives, was to describe a public gathering in honor of a Greek god. The Latin, L. <i>panegyricus</i>, altered slightly to mean "public eulogy," which around the 16th Century shifted to the French <i>panégyrique</i>, which meant "laudation." In any case, the word today stands for high praise given in a speech or tribute as highfalutin as the word itself sounds.</p></div></div>`;
