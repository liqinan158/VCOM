In baseball, a <i>bat</i> can be made out of wood or aluminum.</p><p class="long"><i>Bat</i> can be a verb as well: when you're up at bat in a baseball game, it means it's your turn to bat with the bat. There is also an animal called a <i>bat</i>, a small, nocturnal bird-like mammal. People can be said to "<i>bat</i> their eyelashes," or flutter them flirtatiously, as well. This last meaning, from the mid-1800s, comes from an earlier sense of <i>bat</i>, "flutter like a hawk's wings."</p></div>`;
