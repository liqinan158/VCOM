You can <i>practice</i> shotput every day because your town has a <i>practice</i> of supporting track-and-field events.</p><p class="long">One can <i>practice</i> the tuba for hours on end, repeating the same song over and over, serving to both get better at the tuba and to convince the neighbors they should move to Florida.  You could learn the common <i>practice</i> of offering a guest a beverage when they arrive at your party, if you care to be polite.  One can also <i>practice</i> a profession or a religion, as in “I <i>practice</i> Buddhism and I have a booming international law <i>practice</i>.”</p></div></div>`;
