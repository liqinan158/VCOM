It’s a hateful slur for an African-American, but many African-Americans use the word in a harmless way.</p><p class="long">This word is so heavily loaded that an edition of the Mark Twain classic "Huckleberry Finn" censored <i>nigger</i>, replacing it with <i>slave</i>. For many people, this is a horribly offensive, racist word that should never be said by anyone. For others — in particular, younger African-Americans — this is a casual word that’s been reinvented and means something similar to <i>man</i> or <i>buddy</i>. Because it’s a dangerous word, saying <i>the n-word</i> when discussing <i>nigger</i> is common.</p></div>`;
