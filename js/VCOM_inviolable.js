(Of course, divorce lawyers and bank robbers consider this a challenge.)</p><p class="long">The word can refer to a physical structure (a fortress, for instance) or something more conceptual (human rights or morals, perhaps). <i>Inviolable</i> has changed little from its Latin origin of <i>inviolabilis</i>, which combines the prefix <i>in</i>- (meaning "not") with the verb <i>violare</i> ("to violate"). <i>Inviolable</i> turns up in religious settings too, usually in reference to texts or rites. In that context, it means "sacred." No surprise: the antonym of <i>inviolable</i> is <i>violable</i> ("accessible or penetrable").</p></div>`;
