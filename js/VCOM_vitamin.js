You get some Vitamin D from the sun, and lots of Vitamin C from citrus fruits such as oranges. Without vitamins, your immune system can weaken. Many people take vitamins in pill form to help them stay healthy. The word <i>vitamin</i> — originally <i>vitamine</i> — was coined by scientist Casimir Funk in the early 1900s.
