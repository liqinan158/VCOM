You might find an <i>olive</i> on a salad, on a pizza, or even on a toothpick in your martini.</p><p class="long">Olives are so naturally bitter that they're basically inedible unless they've been treated â€” cured with lye or salt, and then fermented. In addition to the olives you see in jars on grocery store shelves, olive trees yield an expensive, durable wood; and of course, olive oil. You can also describe the yellowish-green color of an unripe olive as <i>olive</i>. And when someone offers "an <i>olive</i> branch," they are trying to make peace or come to an understanding.</p></div></div>`;
