A tax <i>dodger</i>, for example, schemes to avoid paying taxes.</p><p class="long">There are many kinds of dodgers â€” from fare dodgers who jump the subway turnstile rather than pay the fare, to draft dodgers who snuck to Canada during the Vietnam War, to avoid being drafted by the Army. The most famous dodger is probably the character in Charles Dickens' "Oliver Twist" known as The Artful Dodger, a skilled and savvy pickpocket. In the eighteenth century, it was common to use the word <i>dodge</i> to mean "swindle" or "play shifting tricks."</p></div>`;
