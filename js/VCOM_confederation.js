Perhaps the best-known <i>confederation</i> was the South during the U.S. Civil War.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>confederation</i> comes from the early 15th Century, meaning “an agreement.”  <i>Confederation</i> is similar to the word "federation," but with important differences. Whereas a federation has a strong central government, a confederation is more of an agreement between separate bodies to cooperate with each other. The European alliance could be called a confederation, while the United States is a federation.</p></div></div>`;
