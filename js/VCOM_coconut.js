Coconuts are large brown balls that must be cut or sawed open â€” inside the shell is the coconut meat, and clear coconut water. To use coconut for baking, it has to first be grated and, often, sweetened. The word comes from <i>coco</i>, "grinning face," in Portuguese, which may refer to the three face-like holes in a coconut shell.</p></div>`;
