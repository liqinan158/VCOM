That salesman is a shyster — someone who lies and deceives for his own benefit. The word comes from the German <i>Scheisser</i>, which is a vulgar term for “worthless person.” Although it contains the word <i>shy</i>, it actually sounds more like <i>heist</i>, which makes sense, since shysters are basically trying to rob you.</p></div>`;
