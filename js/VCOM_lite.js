var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">lite</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Lite</i> is how many advertisers and companies spell "light," to describe a product that has less fat, fewer calories, and so on. For example, <i>lite</i> cream cheese is the choice of many dieters.</p><p class="long">If you add <i>lite</i> to the beginning of a word, it usually means lower in calories. <i>Lite</i> beer, sodas, and cookies all contain fewer calories than the regular versions. If you hyphenate <i>lite</i> at the end of a word, it suggests something is lower in substance than the original, like a political leader whose speech to voters might be policy-lite, meaning it does not focus just on laws. Otherwise, you're better off with the <i>light</i> spelling.</p></div>`;
