Most <i>yawning</i> is caused by sleepiness or extreme boredom.</p><p class="long">Use the word <i>yawning</i> for actual yawning â€” or to mean "wide open." A yawning chasm in the ground is a huge, wide gap, and a yawning hole in a movie's plot is the obvious space where some details are missing, making the resulting story seem unlikely and unbelievable. A yawning child, on the other hand, is probably just ready for her nap.</p></div></div>`;
