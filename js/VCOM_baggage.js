If someone says you have <i>baggage</i> but you’re not holding anything, they’re talking about emotional <i>baggage</i>.</p><p class="long">Baggage is the fancy suitcase you collect from an airport carousel or the duffel bag you get out of the trunk. It’s any travel bag you have your personal belongings in. Baggage can also refer to emotions from the past that get in the way of the present. In military terminology, <i>baggage</i> is any equipment that can be carried or hauled along. This is the original definition, from the Old French <i>baggage</i>, "military equipment," from <i>bague</i>, for "bag or bundle."</p></div></div>`;
