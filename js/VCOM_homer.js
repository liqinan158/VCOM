If you hit one out of the park, you've hit a <i>homer</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Homer</i> is short for <i>home run</i>. If there are players on all the bases when a batter gets a homer, it's called a <i>grand slam</i> and it gives the team four points. You can use this word as a verb too, meaning "hit a home run." There are also nearly twenty towns in the US called <i>Homer</i>, but these are named for the ancient Greek epic poet, Homer.</p></div>`;
