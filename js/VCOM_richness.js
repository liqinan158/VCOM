The <i>richness</i> of exotic bird life in Hawaii may be much more appealing to you than the <i>richness</i> of your wealthy neighbors.</p><p class="long">When you use the noun <i>richness</i> to talk about an abundance of something, you're emphasizing how luxurious or bountiful it is. And if you mention the richness of a meal or a dessert, you're talking about its delicious, fatty, and filling nature: "The <i>richness</i> of this chocolate mousse is off the charts!" Sometimes <i>richness</i> also means "intensity," as in the richness of the deep blue sky.</p></div></div>`;
