Insects, birds, people, and the wind help to spread <i>pollen</i> between plants.</p><p class="long">When pollen spreads to the female part of a plant, it germinates, or begins the process of growing a new plant. When pollen spreads like this, it's called <i>pollination</i>, and it's how plants reproduce. Pollen is great for plants but not so great if you have hay fever, an allergy to pollen. The first meaning of <i>pollen</i> was "fine flour," which is what pollen looks like.</p></div></div>`;
