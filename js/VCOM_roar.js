var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">roar</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>roar</i> is to make a ferociously loud sound, like a lion or a tiger. If you go to a football game, you'll hear the crowd <i>roar</i> whenever their team scores a goal.</p><p class="long">A wild animal roars when it makes its long, full cry, and a person (or a thing) can emit a similar roar. Your boisterous uncle roars with laughter, and the frustrated substitute teacher might roar angrily at the class. Motorcycles sometimes roar down the street, and a judge might silence a courtroom when she roars, "Order!" <i>Roar</i> can also act as a noun, meaning the sound itself â€” like the roar of the crowd that drowns out your voice. <i>Roar</i> comes from an imitative Old English root.</p></div>`;
