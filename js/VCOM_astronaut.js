var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">astronaut</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">An <i>astronaut</i> is someone who travels in space. While the term was once reserved for military-trained professionals, recent accessibility of space travel has seen the term <i>astronaut</i> now used to refer to anyone traveling in a spacecraft, including civilians.</p><p class="long">The word <i>astronaut</i> includes the root <i>naut</i>, from <i>nautes</i>, the Greek word for "sailor." This suffix can be used to create many travel-specific words. For example, the Argonauts were mythical Greek sailors on the ship named the Argo. <i>Astronaut</i> gets the <i>astro</i> from the Greek word <i>astron</i>, meaning "star," making an astronaut a “star sailor.” Russian space explorers took the title <i>cosmonauts</i>, with the <i>cosmo</i> part coming from the Greek for "universe," <i>kosmos</i>, so both have the same meaning.</p></div>`;
