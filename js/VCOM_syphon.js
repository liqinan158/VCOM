One way to remove water from a flooded basement is to use a powerful <i>syphon</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>syphon</i>, also spelled <i>siphon</i>, comes from a Greek root meaning "pipe" or "tube for drawing wine from a cask." Syphons work using the power of gravity to pull liquid out of one container and into another. The word is also a verb, meaning "to move using a syphon." Figuratively, you can use it for other kinds of emptying, like when you syphon coins out of your brother's piggy bank.</p></div></div>`;
