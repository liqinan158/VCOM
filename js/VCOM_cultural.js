The chief meaning is anything having to do human intellectual or creative output.</p><p class="long">The word <i>cultural</i> is often used as a synonym for "ethnic," as in, "cultural diversity," which means a variety of people. But it also means having to do with the arts and creativity. When you move, you'll want to move somewhere with a vibrant cultural lifeâ€”lots of museums, libraries, and concert halls. In the middle is a term like "<i>cultural</i> anthropology," which is the study of a population's work, arts, lifestyles, and ways of interacting.</p></div>`;
