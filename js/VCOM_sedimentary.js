Sedimentary is also a type of rock thatâ€™s made from substances left from wind, water, or ice and have been pressed together over time. The other types of rock are igneous (made from lava) and metamorphic (changed from intense heat and pressure). Sedimentary things generally hang out at the bottom of lakes and ponds.</p></div></div>`;
