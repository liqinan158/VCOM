If your relative is tasteless, that's a trickier problem to solve. In the latter case, <i>tasteless</i> means "lacking in judgment" or "offensive." So a joke that hurts someone's feelings is tasteless, and wearing a dress made out of rubbish you found in the recycling bin to your cousin's wedding would also be tasteless â€” unless the wedding's theme is "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle."</p></div>`;
