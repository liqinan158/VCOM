But one week and 100 cupcakes later, it’s become a hard-to-bear <i>burden</i> accompanied by a permanent stomachache.</p><p class="long"><i>Burden</i> is one of those words that doubles as a noun and a verb. Defined as something you carry or withstand with much difficulty when used as a noun, and as the act of weighing down, overloading, or oppressing when used as a verb, it’s a word with a negative charge. Now that you know what it means, you’re equipped to make sure you don’t take on unnecessary burdens (getting pressured into always carrying your neighbor’s groceries upstairs), or become one yourself!</p></div></div>`;
