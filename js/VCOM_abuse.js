If someone else is harming you, you are yourself suffering from <i>abuse</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>abuse</i> is made up of two parts — "use," which means to employ, and <i>ab-,</i> a Latin prefix meaning "away" — and as a whole comes from the Latin <i>abūsus,</i> meaning "misuse," or "use wrongly." It began as a verb and became a noun in the mid-15th century. <i>Abuse</i> also refers to anything that is employed improperly or to excess, such as the abuse of alcohol or drugs.</p></div>`;
