If you stay relaxed and smiling while you're waiting to get a driver's license or on hold with the cable company, you've got an admirable amount of longanimity. The Latin root is <i>longanimitas</i>, which means "long-suffering or patient" and comes from <i>longus</i>, "long," and <i>animus</i>, "spirit or mind."</p></div></div>`;
