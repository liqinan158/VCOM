Chemically, fructose is a simple or <i>hexose</i> sugar, one with six carbon atoms in it, and it's absorbed directly into your bloodstream when you eat it. It's also one of the very sweetest sugars. The word dates from 1857, from the Latin <i>fructus</i>, or "fruit," and the suffix <i>-ose</i>, used in chemical names of sugars.</p></div></div>`;
