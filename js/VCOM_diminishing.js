While <i>diminishing</i> pain is a good thing, <i>diminishing</i> returns on your investment are not so welcome.</p><p class="long"><i>Diminishing</i> comes from the Latin word <i>minuere</i> â€” "to make small." The "law of <i>diminishing</i> returns" refers to the tendency at a certain point for continued effort in an area to begin producing a smaller and smaller result. You might enjoy eating one Sour Patch candy, but if you eat a whole package of them and feel sick? Then, you have come face-to-face with the law of diminishing returns.</p></div></div>`;
