If you find a white animal with black eyes and ears in your garbage at night, it's probably a <i>possum</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>possum</i> is an informal, regional variation on <i>opossum</i> that's only used in North America. It's especially common in the phrase "playing possum," which refers to the possum's involuntary reaction to fear or harm, falling into a death-like faint, and also to a person who pretends to be innocent. So you might accuse your younger brother, as he shrugs when you ask who ate the last brownie, of playing possum.</p></div>`;
