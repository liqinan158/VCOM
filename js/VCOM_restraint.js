For example, if you exercise <i>restraint</i> over your emotions, you won't burst out into tears in public.</p><p class="long">As you may have guessed from its similar spelling, the word <i>restraint</i> comes from the verb <i>restrain</i>, which in turn comes from the Latin word <i>restringere</i>, meaning "draw back tightly, confine, check." When talking about an object, a restraint is a device used to maintain control of something. For example, if your leg is operated on, the doctors will use a restraint to hold it still.</p></div>`;
