In its literal sense, this word can mean "made of or resembling brass," as in a brazen drinking cup from a medieval castle. It can also mean overly or disrespectfully bold. A near synonym of <i>brazen</i> is our English word <i>brassy</i>, which has the additional meaning of being loud and showy.</p></div></div>`;
