If you overeat regularly for a long time, you'll gain extra weight. One indulgent night of overeating may simply give you terrible indigestion and the desire to never see another hot dog in your life. We've used this verb, which comes from the Old English <i>ofer√¶t</i>, "gluttony," since the 1590s.</p></div></div>`;
