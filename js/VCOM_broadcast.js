It also means to tell people about something. If you paint your one true love’s name on your car, you <i>broadcast</i> your feelings to the whole world!</p><p class="long">The word <i>broadcast</i> used to have to do with spreading seed, but now it refers to spreading information. It can be a noun or verb — if you turn on the radio, you're hearing a broadcast, and the station is broadcasting that show. You don’t have to be in a studio to broadcast, though. Any time you let a lot of people know about something (whether they like it or not), you broadcast. When information is broadcast, it becomes widely known.</p></div></div>`;
