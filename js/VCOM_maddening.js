Some drivers have the <i>maddening</i> habit of following other cars too closely on the highway.</p><p class="long">If something annoys you a lot, it's maddening. You might try to ignore the maddening tune your sister keeps whistling, or decide to leave a movie half way through because of the maddening acting style of its leading man. The adjective <i>maddening</i> comes from the less-common verb <i>madden</i>, "annoy someone," or "drive someone insane." Both words are rooted in the Old English <i>gem√¶dde</i>, "out of one's mind."</p></div>`;
