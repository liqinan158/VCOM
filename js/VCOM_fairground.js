Many county fairs are put on at the same <i>fairground</i> for a week or two each summer. Many funnel cakes are eaten there.</p><p class="long">Most fairgrounds have space for rides like Ferris wheels and bumper cars. Agricultural fairs might also have exhibit areas where visitors can see animals, handmade items, baked goods, giant watermelons, and other impressive produce.
