If your parents are always traveling and you have to take care of your six younger siblings, you probably feel like the <i>steward</i> of the house.</p><p class="long">You might have heard the term "stewardess," a female flight attendant, but the name has trickled out of use in favor of the gender-neutral "flight attendant." A steward is the male version of that. Anyone who takes care of places or people is a steward. You can be a steward of artifacts from an architectural dig. You can also be elected to be the steward of your co-workers retirement fund. Either way, someone's trusting you with their stuff.</p></div></div>`;
