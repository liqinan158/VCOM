A greedy person might appear to have beady eyes, and so might an intent listener in a college class. The word can also mean "decorated with beads," but this is much less common. At the heart of <i>beady</i> is <i>bead</i>, from <i>bede</i>, "prayer bead," by way of the Old English <i>gebed</i>, or "prayer."</p></div>`;
