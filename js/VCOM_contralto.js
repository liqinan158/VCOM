A <i>contralto</i> generally sings the harmony when she's singing with another woman.</p><p class="long">While it's mainly classical music that uses the term <i>contralto</i>, it's also occasionally used in jazz to describe a very low female singing voice. If a man is singing the same notes and range as a contralto, he's called a <i>countertenor</i>. Like most musical terms, <i>contralto</i> is an Italian word. Its roots are <i>contra-</i>, "against or opposite," and <i>alto</i>, a slightly higher voice â€” in other words, "the next voice after alto."</p></div></div>`;
