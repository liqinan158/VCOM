You can <i>bisect</i> a cupcake so that you and a friend get equal pieces.</p><p class="long">In Latin, <i>bi</i> means "two" and <i>secare</i> means "to cut." That's why the verb <i>bisect</i> means "divide into two equal pieces." You might bisect your garden, planting half with vegetables and half with flowers, or tape a line on your bedroom floor to bisect the space into two sides â€” yours and your horrible sister's. In geometry, the word <i>bisect</i> means the same thing, to split something into equal halves.</p></div></div>`;
