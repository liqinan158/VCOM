To your surprise, and horror, instead of your usual rosy complexion, your skin is yellow and the whites of your eyes are yellow, too! You, my friend, are <i>jaundiced</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Jaundice</i> is from the Greek, <i>ikteros</i>, which referred to both the disease and a rare, yellow bird. It was thought that someone with <i>jaundice</i> could stare at this yellow bird, and the <i>jaundice</i> would be magically transferred to the bird. <i>Jaundiced</i> can also refer to ideas or feelings being distorted by negative views or qualities, since yellow has been associated with bitterness and envy. Too bad there is no bird to get rid of that!</p></div>`;
