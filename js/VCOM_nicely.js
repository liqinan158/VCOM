Asking your brother <i>nicely</i> to borrow ten dollars is likely to work a lot better than demanding a loan.</p><p class="long">A nicely dressed applicant has an advantage at a job interview over someone wearing ripped jeans. You can use the adverb <i>nicely</i> to mean "attractively," "politely," or "in a satisfactory way." It comes from <i>nice</i>, which originally meant "foolish," and whose meaning has changed in an unusually dramatic way over the years, from "stupid," to "fussy," to "delicate," and finally to "agreeable."</p></div>`;
