You can spot the tourists in these cities because they are often gazing up at the tops of the skyscrapers. The designation of a building as a <i>skyscraper</i> was originally an Americanism, but the earliest recorded use of <i>skyscraper</i> was for a  triangular sail set topmost on a square-rigged ship, and at other times in the past the word was used to designate a very tall man and a high-flying bird, among other things.</p></div></div>`;
