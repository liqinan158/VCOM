After his sixth hot dog, you might say to your friend, "Well! <i>Apparently</i> somebody was hungry!"</p><p class="long">While <i>apparently</i> can mean "plainly" — like, duh — it can also mean "seemingly," which is almost "evidently" or "obviously," but not quite. There's a certain amount of guessing involved, based on appearances. The park ranger who shows up in the morning to examine the path of destruction through your campsite might say that it was "apparently the work of a hungry bear," not because he's totally sure, but because it definitely looks like something the bears around here would do.</p></div></div>`;
