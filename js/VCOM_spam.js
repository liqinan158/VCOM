Not until the early 1990s did the more modern definition of <i>spam</i> come into use, referring to multi-recipient email or other online messages that are mostly sent for commercial advertising or marketing purposes. To send such a message is "to <i>spam</i>" the people you're sending it to.</p></div>`;
