It’s the strip of land a plane uses to take off and land on, or a narrow platform that a model uses to show off the latest fashions.</p><p class="long">A plane needs a runway of a certain length in order to gather enough speed to take off, and it likewise needs a long enough runway when it lands to slow down and come to a safe stop. Even the very shortest runways are more than 800 feet long — and the world's longest runway, at California's Edwards Air Force Base, is nearly 40,000 feet long. The original meaning of <i>runway</i> was "usual track of an animal."</p></div>`;
