In biology, it's a taxonomic group covering more than one species.</p><p class="long">This is a term used by biologists to classify more than one species under a larger umbrella. In biology, the word family describes the broadest group category, then genus, and then species. For example, primates are a family, and humans are a species within that family, but we're not in the same genus as macaques: macaques have their own genus. Dogs and wolves are so closely related theyâ€™re in the same genus. The plural of <i>genus</i> is <i>genera</i>.</p></div></div>`;
