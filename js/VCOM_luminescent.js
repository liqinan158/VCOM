Other luminescent things include light bulbs, the stars in the night sky, glow worms, and certain glowing jellyfish and other sea creatures. When a living thing is luminescent, it's a phenomenon called <i>bioluminescence</i>. The Latin root of both words is <i>lumen</i>, meaning "light."</p></div></div>`;
