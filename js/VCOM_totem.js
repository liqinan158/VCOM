Each <i>totem</i> represents a family, clan, or tribe. Do you come from a long line of fishermen? Perhaps your family’s <i>totem</i> is a trout.</p><p class="long">Any group can have a totem, but the word <i>totem</i> is from the Algonquian (Native American) word <i>odoodeman</i> for "his family mark." Totems are pictures — usually on badges or emblems — of animals or plants that represent a group of people, especially an extended family or clan. A totem could be a grizzly bear, oak tree, catfish, or just about any other living thing. Like a flag, a totem means a lot to the people it represents.</p></div>`;
