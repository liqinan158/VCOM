If you climb to the top of a mountain, suggest that your fellow climbers take time to admire the <i>expanse</i> of trees below.</p><p class="long"><i>Expanse</i> looks like the word <i>expand</i>. Both come from the Latin word <i>expandere</i>, meaning "to spread out, unfold." But where did <i>expandere</i> come from? <i>Ex-</i> means "out" and <i>pandere</i> means "spread or stretch." So an expanse is something that seems to unfold before your eyes, or to put it another way, something that stretches out as far as the eye can see.</p></div>`;
