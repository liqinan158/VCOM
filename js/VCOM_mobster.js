Someone who belongs to such a group is a mobster or a gangster. The term <i>mobster</i> comes from <i>mob</i>, another name for the Mafia, an Italian organized crime group. Originally <i>mob</i> meant just "a large group of people" or "the common people," from the Latin phrase <i>mobile vulgus</i>, "fickle common people."</p></div></div>`;
