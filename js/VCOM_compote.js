It is served as a dessert or as a side dish. Yum.</p><p class="long">Unless you're a cook this noun may not ring any bells — it refers to a dish that's not so much in fashion these days: stewed fruit in syrup. Most of the words this one might remind you of, such as <i>compose, composite,</i> and <i>compost,</i> are indeed related to it: they all come from Latin <i>composita,</i> which means "mixture." If you like fruit and sweetness, you might like compote, which has usually been eaten as a dessert.</p></div>`;
