It’s the state of not being visibly active yet — like when you're hiding out and waiting to jump up and yell "Surprise!"</p><p class="long">Perhaps a little late, perhaps right on time, <i>latency</i> will wake up from its nap eventually. For a characteristic or skill to be in a period of latency, it does have to exist. So you should only use <i>latency</i> to describe your pitching ability if there is a fastball in you somewhere – otherwise, just admit you can’t pitch. If you’re in the lab, <i>latency</i> is also used to describe the period between a stimulus and a response.</p></div></div>`;
