So go ahead and call your next dentist appointment or lunch date with friends a <i>rendezvous</i>.</p><p class="long">In the 1590s, <i>rendezvous</i> meant “a place for assembling of troops.” And you'll still hear military tacticians talking about "rendezvous points" today. But more often we use <i>rendezvous</i> to describe an assembling of friends, an appointment, or a date with your secret lover. If you're feeling extra Frenchy, you can use <i>rendezvous</i> as a verb, as in "Let's rendezvous next Saturday at the mall."</p></div></div>`;
