If you think that eating apples might cure depression, that's a hypothesis. Round up your saddest friends, make them eat apples for a month, and see if it works. Doing experiments to test hypotheses is the foundation of the scientific method. A successful experiment doesn't mean you necessarily found the be-all-end-all truth, but the method helped you get closer to it.</p></div>`;
