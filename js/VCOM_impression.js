To make a good <i>impression</i> on your friend's parents, don't let your muddy boots leave <i>impressions</i> on their perfect white kitchen floor.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>impression</i> comes from the Latin word <i>imprimere</i>, which means “press into or upon,” or “stamp.” When you press a coin into a piece of modeling clay there will be an impression, or likeness, of its design in the clay. Another kind of impression is a performance in which you act, talk, move and even attempt to look like another person, like the impression of your teacher that got you into trouble when he saw you.</p></div>`;
