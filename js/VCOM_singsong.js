Kindergarten teachers are generally good at saying things like, "Everybody put your coats on for recess," in a <i>singsong</i> voice.</p><p class="long">A child will fall asleep easily listening to his dad's singsong reading of a bedtime story; and the singsong call of her master will catch a dog's attention at the dog park. <i>Singsong</i> means just what it sounds like, a rhythmic, chanting kind of almost-singing. In some parts of the world, it's also the same as a singalong, or group song. An earlier meaning, from the 17th century, was "a jingling ballad."</p></div>`;
