If you're angry but you don't want it to show, you might speak in a <i>restrained</i> manner.</p><p class="long"><i>Restrained</i> can describe someone or something that is physically immobilized or held back. For example, an angry crowd might have to be restrained by riot police. Or it can mean a different kind of holding back and describe something that is understated and discreet. Actresses who walk the red carpet often avoid attention-getting gowns in favor of more restrained outfits in times of war or national crisis.</p></div></div>`;
