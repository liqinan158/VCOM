An <i>acclivity</i> is an uphill slope, so you’ll have to pedal a little harder to get to the top.</p><p class="long">The word <i>acclivity</i> traces back to the Latin word <i>acclivis</i>, meaning “ascending,” which is a combination of <i>ad-</i>, meaning “toward,” and <i>clivus</i>, meaning “slope.” If you encounter an acclivity, it’s going to be all uphill until you get to the top. The opposite of an acclivity is a declivity, which has a similar Latin origin. In the case of <i>declivity</i>, it’s the <i>de-</i> prefix, meaning “down,” that moves things in the opposite direction and gives it the meaning of “downhill slope.”</p></div>`;
