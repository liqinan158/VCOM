If you live at the <i>junction</i> of Main and State streets, then your house is where those two streets meet.</p><p class="long"><i>Junction</i> often refers to the point where streets or railway lines come together, but it can describe other things that are joined, especially things that are in motion or transmit other things. For example, your body has nerve junctions â€” the places where your nerves come together. You may go swimming at the junction of two rivers. <i>Junction</i> can also refer to something that connects things, like a junction you use to connect electrical cords.</p></div>`;
