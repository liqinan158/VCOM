If you see someone hunting deer in a state park that's got "No Hunting" signs posted on trees, that person is a <i>poacher</i>.</p><p class="long">If you don't follow the rules and laws about hunting, but grab your shotgun and head into your neighbor's yard to shoot rabbits, you're in danger of being a poacher. Someone who captures wild animals illegally is also a poacher. A completely different, much nicer kind of poacher is the one you use for poaching eggs â€” this type of poaching consists of gently cooking food by submerging it in simmering water.</p></div></div>`;
