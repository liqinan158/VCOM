One was the astrolabe. An astrolabe had the same purpose as the sextant, which came later: to make astronomical measurements. An astrolabe was portable, and it consisted of a metal disc, a sighting arm, and several rotating parts used in estimating unfathomable distances. The astrolabe was an important invention in the history of astronomy and astrology.</p></div>`;
