Even though you usually take the stairs to your apartment, when you're exhausted you might decide to take the <i>elevator</i> instead.</p><p class="long">Most elevators run on electricity, although in the 19th century the first elevators used steam power to move heavy goods in coal mines. Today, elevators are legally required in tall buildings, so that people who aren't able to climb stairs have access to all floors. In the 1640's, <i>elevator</i> meant "muscles used to raise the body," from the Latin <i>elevator</i>, "one who raises up."</p></div>`;
