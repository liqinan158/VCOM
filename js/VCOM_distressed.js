You feel worn out and pulled in different directions â€” which rings true to the word's origin: the Latin word <i>districtus</i>, meaning "drawn apart." Being distressed physically means your body is injured and hurts, and if you've ever seen jeans called "distressed," you know they've been made to look worn and possibly even falling apart.</p></div>`;
