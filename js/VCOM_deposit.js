In that sentence, <i>deposit</i> is a noun, but you could express the same action using <i>deposit</i> as a verb. You <i>deposit</i> money into your bank account.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>deposit</i> can be used to refer to anything that you put down or in place. If you're carrying your keys and groceries from the car, you may deposit those items on the counter. Just be careful you don't end up playing "where are my keys" in the morning, if the counter is not your usual place for depositing them. You can also use <i>deposit</i> when nature does the placing. You find a deposit of gold in the mountain rock or there is sediment deposited at the bottom of a river.</p></div></div>`;
