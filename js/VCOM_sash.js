The <i>sash</i> on a small child's dress often ties in back with a large bow.</p><p class="long">A long dress's sash or a swashbuckling pirate's sash usually ties around the waist, while the sash on a soldier's uniform or a girl scout's outfit fastens across one shoulder. There's also a second meaning of <i>sash</i> — a sliding window frame, the part that holds the glass panes in place. This kind of sash is rooted in the French <i>châssis</i>, or "frame," while the clothing kind of sash comes from the Arabic <i>shash</i>, "muslin cloth."</p></div></div>`;
