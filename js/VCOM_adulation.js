It's made up of the roots <i>ad</i> ("to") and <i>ulos</i> ("tail"), and if you're thinking of a dog wagging its tail to and fro to get a treat from its owner, you're on the right track. As anyone who's seen a crazed fan drooling over a celebrity knows, adulation is one of the more doglike of human behaviors.</p></div></div>`;
