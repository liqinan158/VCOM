Some reptiles and fish are <i>ovoviviparous</i>.</p><p class="long">Animals reproduce in many different ways, from giving birth to live babies to laying eggs. When an animal is ovoviviparous, its young develop in eggs too, but the eggs stay inside the mother until they hatch: only then do the young emerge. Rattlesnakes are one animal that is ovoviviparous, and so are some kinds of sharks and rays. The adjective <i>ovoviviparous</i> combines the Greek <i>ovum</i>, "egg," with the Latin <i>vivus</i>, "alive," and <i>parere</i>, "bring forth or bear."</p></div>`;
