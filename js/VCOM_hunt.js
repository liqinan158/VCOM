In Italy, they use pigs to <i>hunt</i> truffles. In the US, they use shotguns to <i>hunt</i> deer.</p><p class="long">Some humans hunt animals with a gun or a bow and arrow, and some animals hunt smaller animals â€” the way a wolf hunts rabbits or a cat hunts birds. You can hunt in a non-lethal way as well, like when you hunt all over your house for your lost car keys, or your little brother hunts for you during a game of hide-and-seek. The Old English root of <i>hunt</i> is <i>huntian</i>, "chase game."</p></div></div>`;
