If you're pretty sure your dad will <i>overreact</i> when he hears about your fender bender, you might want to tell your mom first.</p><p class="long">Whenever someone reacts more emotionally than seems appropriate, they <i>overreact</i>. You might overreact to a happy plot twist in your favorite TV show by cheering and jumping up and down â€” and a city bus driver might overreact to a passenger listening to loud music by pulling the bus over to the side of the road and turning to yell angrily. <i>Overreact</i> was first used in the 1960s, probably by historian and literary critic Lewis Mumford.</p></div></div>`;
