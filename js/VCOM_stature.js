Your grandmother might be small in <i>stature</i>, or height, but have great <i>stature</i>, or esteem, in her community.</p><p class="long"><i>Stature</i> comes from the Latin word <i>statura</i>, meaning "height, size of body, growth," but today, it  also means "a high level of respect gained by achievement." For example, after you win a Nobel Prize, your new stature will bring new fans, more sales of your book, invitations to many exclusive dinner parties, and maybe even your picture on magazine covers all over the world.</p></div>`;
