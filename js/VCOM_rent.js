If you're not sure which musical instrument you'll stick with and enjoy playing, it's best to <i>rent</i> a few to try out before buying.</p><p class="long"><i>Rent</i> is both a verb and a noun for borrowing or leasing something. If you rent an apartment, you pay money to live there, and that money is also rent. You can rent many things, from skates at a roller rink to furniture for the home you rent. You don't own things you rent â€” you just use them temporarily. A <i>rent</i> is also a rip: "She fell and tore a big <i>rent</i> in one knee of her jeans."</p></div>`;
