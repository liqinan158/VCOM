If your synopsis of last week's episode of your favorite TV show is funny and sharp, you can call it an <i>apercu</i>.</p><p class="long">Sometimes an apercu is simply a witty comment or a clever anecdote: "He is so fun at parties because he always comes up with such brilliant <i>apercus</i>." The word is often spelled with a cedilla, a French accent that softens the <i>C</i> so that it's pronounced like an <i>S</i>: <i>aper√ßu</i>. The word is from the French <i>apercevoir</i>, "to perceive."</p></div>`;
