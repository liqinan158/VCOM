If your entire math class joined together in rebellion against your teacher's unfair grading practices, you could call it an <i>uprising</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>uprising</i> is most often used to describe a political revolt, often a violent insurrection against the established rule, but its original meaning was very different. In the thirteenth century, an uprising was a resurrection, or "the action of rising from the grave," and soon after that it meant "an action of rising from the bed."
