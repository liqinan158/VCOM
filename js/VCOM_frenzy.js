Stay away from hungry sharks or kids at a 16th birthday party when the pizza arrives if you don't want to get caught up in a feeding <i>frenzy</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Frenzy</i> is derived from the Latin word <i>phreneticus</i> meaning "delirious." If you're in a frenzy, you're certainly delirious. You can be in a frenzy because something made you mad, happy, or even just hungry â€” whatever makes you so crazy you're not thinking clearly. <i>Frenzy</i> is often used when talking about a group of people (or animals) who get worked up at the same time about the same thing, like sharks near tasty fish or teenagers near pizza.</p></div></div>`;
