If you've ever eaten guacamole, you've tasted <i>avocado</i>.</p><p class="long">It might seem strange that an avocado is a fruit, because it's not sweet. Avocados have to be cut open before you eat them, and the hard pit in the middle needs to be removed. The inside of an avocado is firm but soft, a pale green shade. The word <i>avocado</i> is Spanish, from <i>aguacate</i>, and rooted in a Proto-Aztecan word, <i>*pawa</i>, that also meant <i>avocado</i>.</p></div></div>`;
