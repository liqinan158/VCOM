Your next door neighbor's piano playing is also indiscernible if he plays quietly, with the windows shut so you can't hear. The adjective <i>indiscernible</i> adds the "not" or "opposite of" prefix <i>in-</i> to <i>discernible</i>, from its Latin root <i>discernere</i>, "to set apart," or "to distinguish."</p></div></div>`;
