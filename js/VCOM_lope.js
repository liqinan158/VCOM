It's also fun to think about, as it means to move with a casual, striding gait. Imagine a horse cantering along with an easy <i>lope</i>. A pleasant image indeed.</p><p class="long">Before 1825, the meaning of <i>lope</i> was in the line of a leap or springy jump. This comes from the Old Norse word <i>hlaupa</i>, which sounds like its English meaning, "to leap." This is similar to the Old Dutch <i>lopen</i>, "to run," and the Old English <i>hlÄ“apan</i>, "leap," as well as the Scots <i>loup</i>, all related to the modern meaning: a long, striding gait with a little bounce to it.</p></div></div>`;
