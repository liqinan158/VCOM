If you <i>lease</i> a car from a dealer, for example, you make payments and you get to drive the car, but at the end of the contract you have to give it back.</p><p class="long">As a noun, a <i>lease</i> is both the thing you are contracting to rent (the car itself is a lease) and the contract spelling out the terms of use — in other words, a rental agreement. Be sure to check the fine print on your apartment lease to avoid any unpleasant surprises when you move out — like owing money for painting over that hideous wallpaper in the living room.</p></div></div>`;
