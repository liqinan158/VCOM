You can also <i>disappoint</i> yourself or find that things let you down, like a rainy trip to the beach that <i>disappoints</i> you.</p><p class="long">The word <i>disappoint</i> comes from the Middle French word <i>desappointer,</i> which meant "dispossess of appointed office," in the 14th century. Today, <i>disappoint</i> can apply to anyone or anything that does not achieve the expected results â€” and ways to express that we are disappointed go beyond firing people or kicking them out of office. For example, if you buy a product that disappoints, you won't buy it again.</p></div></div>`;
