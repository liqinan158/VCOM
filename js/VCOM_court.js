Many popular television shows feature scenes in <i>court</i>, although it’s debatable whether these depictions are realistic.</p><p class="long"><i>Court</i> can refer not just to the courtroom but also to the judges who preside over it, as in the example of the U.S. Supreme Court. <i>Court</i> can also refer to monarchs and their attendants, as in the phrase "royal court." As a verb, <i>court</i> means “try to win the affections of someone,” as, historically, people sought to win the favor of royalty. (But if you try courting anyone in a modern courtroom, you'll probably be accused of bribery.)</p></div></div>`;
