But while <i>judicial</i> is most often used when describing legal proceedings, it can also be used to describe anyone who has to judge something in a fair way. Film critics are expected to give judicial reviews, just as the Miss America pageant judges must be judicial when assessing the swimsuit competition.</p></div></div>`;
