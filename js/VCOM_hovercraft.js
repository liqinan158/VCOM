Do you need to deliver a batch of cookies to the far side of the lake and down a dirt road? Better take the <i>hovercraft</i>!</p><p class="long">Although it's not always obvious when you watch a hovercraft move, it does actually hover above the ground or water surface while it's moving. Hovercrafts use air pressure and currents to glide freely over difficult terrain, including mud and ice. As it rides on a "cushion of air," a hovercraft is also known as an "air-cushion vehicle" or "ACV." It takes an actual aircraft pilot to operate one.</p></div>`;
