Fisherman often used <i>bull's-eyes</i> on their boats.</p><p class="long">A bull's-eye was a metal lantern, usually made of tin, that was distinguished by its glass lens, which allowed light to be focused in a particular direction. This light could be covered or revealed by sliding a little panel open or closed. In other words, a bull's-eye was very much like an early 18th century flashlight. The earliest true flashlights used a similar glass lens, at the time called a "<i>bull's-eye</i> lens."</p></div>`;
