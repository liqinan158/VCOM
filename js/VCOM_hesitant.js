Being hesitant will make you <i>hesitate</i> for a bit, waiting to see what happens next. Nervousness or fear will make your actions hesitant, like when trying to walk across a rickety wooden bridge.  Should you keep going or turn back?  Your hesitant steps show that you’re still wrestling with that question.  Whatever you decide, don’t look down.</p></div></div>`;
