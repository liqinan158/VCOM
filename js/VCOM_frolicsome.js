So spin like an Olympic skater who's going for the gold, suddenly start a race, or act like a clown, pretending to fall on the ice. You are feeling frolicsome â€” happy and lighthearted, laughing along with the people you are amusing. When you are frolicsome, you frolic, or act playfully to have fun.</p></div>`;
