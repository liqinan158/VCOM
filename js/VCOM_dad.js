It’s a word like "pop" or "daddy." Some families have two <i>dads</i>, others have none. Sometimes a <i>dad</i> gets a “World’s Greatest Dad” mug on Father’s Day. Well done, sir.</p><p class="long">If you’re talking about any ol’ dad, don’t capitalize it. There are dads all over the place. If you’re addressing your own father, basically using <i>Dad</i> as his name, do capitalize the “d.” The word dates from at least 1500, and it's believed to come from childish speech, or baby talk, since a very common first sound made by babies is "da."</p></div></div>`;
