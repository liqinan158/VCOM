The best views of the Manhattan <i>skyline</i> are from New Jersey and Brooklyn.</p><p class="long">When you're near a city but not in the center of it, you can really appreciate its skyline. Officially, you don't need a full-fledged city to have a skyline, just an outline of land or buildings along the horizon. Still, when you think of skylines, you probably think of New York or Los Angeles or Shanghai. The word dates from 1824.</p></div></div>`;
