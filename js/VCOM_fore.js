A cruise ship might be so large that your cabin at the ship's <i>fore</i> is almost a quarter mile from your sister's in the aft.</p><p class="long"><i>Fore</i> also refers more generally to something at or near the front, like someone who's at the fore of her profession as a pastry chef. As an adjective, <i>fore</i> also describes things close to the front â€” your puppy's fore legs are the ones in front. When golfers shout, "<i>Fore!</i>" it's a warning to watch out for the ball, or to "look ahead."</p></div></div>`;
