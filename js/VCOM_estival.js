When a sunny day in April has an <i>estival</i> feel to it, it's one of those days that seems so much like summer that you might be tempted to go barefoot.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>estival</i> is rarely used, and it's usually found in formal or technical writing. However, there's no reason not to use it when you want to describe something that has to do with summer, like a blue estival sky. <i>Estival</i> comes from the Latin word <i>aestus</i>, or "heat." There are equivalent adjectives for the other seasons, too â€” <i>autumnal</i> for autumn, <i>hibernal</i> for winter, and <i>vernal</i> for spring.</p></div>`;
