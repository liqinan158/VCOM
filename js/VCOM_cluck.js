One of the best things about keeping chickens in your yard is watching them scratch the dirt and listening to their <i>clucks</i>.</p><p class="long">A chicken or hen clucks when she's rounding up her chicks, making a short, relatively deep sound. To do this is also to <i>cluck</i>, and you can use the word to talk about a fussy or overprotective parent too: "It's so funny watching him <i>cluck</i> over his kids at the playground." The Old English root of <i>cluck</i> is <i>cloccian</i>, and both words are imitative â€” they echo the sound they're describing.</p></div></div>`;
