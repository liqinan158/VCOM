When we refer to the continental United States, we mean the whole country <i>except</i> Alaska and Hawaii.</p><p class="long">This word can also be used as a conjunction meaning "but": If you're not very hungry, you might not eat anything, except a few crackers. As a verb, <i>except</i> is often used in the past tense: All drivers must obey the speed limit, but ambulances rushing to the hospital are excepted. Much more rare is the use of <i>except</i> as a verb meaning "to object," which we find mostly in legal contexts.</p></div></div>`;
