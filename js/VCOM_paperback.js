If you wait to buy a book until it comes out as a <i>paperback</i>, you'll save money.</p><p class="long">In the 1830s and 40s, publishers began offering inexpensive versions of already-published books with paper covers, and the word <i>paperback</i> followed in 1888. Paperbacks are popular because they're smaller, lighter, and less expensive than their stiffly bound hardcover counterparts. A paperback edition of a book is usually released about a year after the book is first published in hardcover, although some books, called paperback originals, are published only in paperback form.</p></div></div>`;
