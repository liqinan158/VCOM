It's uncommon today, but when homes were often heated with coal fires, the extra coal would be kept in a <i>coal scuttle</i> near the stove.</p><p class="long">Long ago, it wasn't unusual to add coal from a coal scuttle to a fire that warmed your home. When trains ran on coal, they needed constant burning fires and a coal scuttle from which stokers could feed them. As coal fuel becomes less common, coal scuttles are also increasingly unusual. The <i>scuttle</i> part of the word comes from the Old English <i>scutel</i>, "dish or platter," from the Latin <i>scutella</i>, "serving platter."</p></div></div>`;
