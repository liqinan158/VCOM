If you're a member of the <i>jet set</i>, you might even have a private plane to fly you across the globe for an exclusive party in Beijing.</p><p class="long">Before there was a jet set, there was "café society," a set of people rich enough to spend their days in fashionable restaurants, bars, and cafés. In the early 1950s, the journalist Igor Cassini coined the phrase <i>jet set</i> for a similar group, one wealthy enough to take advantage of the new commercial air liner and its expensive, quick flights. As air travel became accessible to more people, <i>jet set</i> began to be used much less often.</p></div>`;
