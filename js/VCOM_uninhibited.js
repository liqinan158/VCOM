Someone who is <i>uninhibited</i> is not afraid to act however he or she wishes.</p><p class="long"><i>Uninhibited</i> is the opposite of <i>inhibited</i>, from the Latin <i>inhibÄ“re</i>, "to prohibit or hinder."  In the late 19th century the word took on a new importance to psychologists, describing a person not afraid to express emotions, even in public. The following quote from writer Norman Podhoretz gives a contextual definition: "Creativity represents a miraculous coming together of the uninhibited energy of the child with its apparent opposite and enemy, the sense of order imposed on the disciplined adult intelligence."</p></div>`;
