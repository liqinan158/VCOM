If you’re responsive to other people’s suggestions and not set in your ways, then you’re not only <i>receptive</i>, but flexible.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>receptive</i> actually comes from a Latin word that means <i>receive</i>. So a receptive person is willing to receive things, especially opposing arguments, constructive criticism, and helpful hints. How receptive you are speaks to your willingness to have an impression made upon you. It can be good to be large and in charge sometimes, but you can also benefit from stepping back and being receptive to what life brings.</p></div>`;
