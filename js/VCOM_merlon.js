The narrow opening or tiny window in a <i>merlon</i> is called an "embrasure slit."</p><p class="long">Merlons are always solid, and often they are the upright, pointed sections of a parapet or fortification wall. If there are wide spaces between the merlons, they are called "crenels." You can see merlons on a variety of old forts and castles, as they were commonly used from medieval times on. The Italian root is <i>merlone</i>, from <i>merlo</i>, "battlement," possibly from the Latin <i>mergae</i>, "two-pronged pitchfork."</p></div>`;
