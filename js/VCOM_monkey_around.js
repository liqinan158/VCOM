When you <i>monkey around</i> with something, you often fiddle with it in an attempt to fix it or figure it out. You might, for example, <i>monkey around</i> with your dad's broken computer.</p><p class="long">If a mother who's heading off to work warns her teenager, "Don't just <i>monkey around</i> today," she means that she wants her child to accomplish something worthwhile. If you monkey around, you might do a few random tasks, but mostly you're just fooling around. The expression comes from the way monkeys play: they don't accomplish much, but they have a lot of fun.</p></div></div>`;
