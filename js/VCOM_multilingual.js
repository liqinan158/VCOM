Then you are <i>multilingual</i>, which is an impressive and practical thing to be.</p><p class="long">Multilingual people can speak and/or write more than one language, whether that's English and Japanese, Spanish and sign language, or French and Klingon. Except for the silly example of Klingon, being multilingual is extremely useful â€” it can help you get jobs and succeed in life, because you're able to communicate with more people. Becoming multilingual is a great goal for anyone. It helps you learn about the world and do more than a monolingual person can.</p></div>`;
