Negative political ads vituperate against opponents. When you insult someone and swear at them, you vituperate. People with a short temper tend to vituperate often â€” it's similar to railing, vilifying, and reviling. The root word is the Latin <i>vituperationem</i>, "blame or censuring," from <i>vitium</i>, "fault or defect."</p></div>`;
