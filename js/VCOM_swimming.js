To you, swimming may involve splashing through the waves or dog-paddling across a public pool. Olympic athletes, on the other hand, swim distances as far as 1500 meters at unbelievable speeds. As an adjective, <i>swimming</i> describes anything that swims or that's used for swimming, like a swimming hole.
