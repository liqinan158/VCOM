Jewelry makers often use small, narrow <i>pliers</i> to bend thin pieces of wire.</p><p class="long">There are many different types of pliers that do various jobs, from large, wrench-like pliers that plumbers use on pipes to tiny "needle-nose <i>pliers</i>" that electricians can fit into narrow spaces and grip small wires. Why pliers always come in "pairs" like jeans, eyeglasses, and scissors is a bit of a mystery. The word stems from the verb <i>ply</i>, "work with" or "use."</p></div>`;
