So how did it come to mean "ambition" or "the will to succeed"? The Latin gives us a clue: <i>spirare</i> ("to breathe") and <i>spiritus</i> ("spirit"). It was once believed that our breath was our soul or spirit, which might explain why we talk about "breathing life into" something, or coming up with energy and ideas to invigorate it. How else to breathe life into something than with ambition and drive, in other words, "spirit"?</p></div></div>`;
