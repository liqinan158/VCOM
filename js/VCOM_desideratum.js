It's a fancy word for a must-have.</p><p class="long">This official-sounding Latin word means something very common: anything you want or need. A new book could be a desideratum. A chocolate cake could be a desideratum. More commonly, a desideratum is something that is truly needed, like food or shelter. For many people, a happy marriage is a desideratum. For a politician, getting elected is a desideratum. You can almost see the word <i>desire</i> in <i>desideratum</i>, and that should help you remember itâ€™s an object of desire.</p></div></div>`;
