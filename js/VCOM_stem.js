So roses have <i>stems</i>, and your idea to give roses to your mom for her birthday <i>stems</i> from her love of flowers.</p><p class="long">A <i>stem</i> can be the central root of a word, the supporting structure of a plant, or the thin, cylindrical part of a glass goblet. When one thing stems from something else, it originates or begins growing there: "His vegetarianism stems from his love of animals." An older meaning of the verb is "stop the flow of something," as in "Stem your nosebleed with this tissue!" or "Some people think streetlights will stem the graffiti on that street."</p></div></div>`;
