Your school admits only geniuses? You've been admitted to your school? It's <i>deducible</i> that you're a genius.</p><p class="long">Something <i>deducible</i> is able to be <i>deduced</i>. Both words include the Latin roots meaning "from" (<i>de-</i>) and "lead" (<i>ducere</i>).  So the <i>deducible</i> conclusion is one you're led to — by means of reasoning — from a general principle. You might learn from experts the general principle that all goats love to eat grass. You've got a pet goat in your backyard. It's <i>deducible</i> that you'd better find some grass for your goat.</p></div></div>`;
