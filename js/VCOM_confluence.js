In a literal sense, it's about rivers.

When things come together like rivers do, flowing from entirely different places, you call that a <i>confluence</i>. If the senior class needs to raise money for a class trip, and the drama club is looking for someone to do concessions during intermission at the school play, that's a confluence of factors.</p></div>`;
