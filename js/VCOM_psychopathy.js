Although it's a common term in criminal justice, <i>psychopathy</i> isn't an official psychiatric diagnosis.</p><p class="long">If someone has psychopathy, they're referred to as a psychopath. As common as these terms are, a psychiatrist or psychologist won't diagnose someone with psychopathy â€” a patient with these symptoms will likely get a diagnosis of "antisocial personality disorder." A common test measuring psychopathy is used to study prison populations and for sentencing violent criminals. <i>Psychopathy</i> comes from the Greek roots <i>psykhe</i>, "mind," and <i>pathos</i>, "suffering."</p></div></div>`;
