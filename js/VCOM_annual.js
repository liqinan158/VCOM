An <i>annual</i> holiday party should be a time for fun, but it also can be a sad yearly reminder of the passage of time.</p><p class="long">An <i>annual</i> event happens every year: "I always forget to take sunglasses to my <i>annual</i> eye exam and am left wearing those horrible disposable shades." <i>Annual</i> earnings are made over the course of a year: "His <i>annual</i> income is on a steady decline."  And an <i>annual</i> plant lives for only a year: "My neighbor Shirley always plants the most garishly bright <i>annuals</i> instead of more subdued perennials." Whether it's eye exams, income, or plants, you can expect to see something annual again in about 365 days.</p></div>`;
