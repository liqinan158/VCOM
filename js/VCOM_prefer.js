Gag me!" Note that <i>prefer</i> means not just to like, but to like better––you're comparing two or more things. Whether it be chocolate ice cream over other flavors, or getting going first thing in the morning as opposed to lounging in your PJs, what you prefer is called your <i>preference</i>. And if you like them all the same, you can say you have no preference</p></div>`;
