You probably took your first <i>algebra</i> class early in your high school years.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>algebra</i> comes from Arabic word <i>al jebr</i>, meaning "reunion of broken parts," which appeared in the title of mathematician al-Khwarizmi's famous book on equations. In algebra you use basic arithmetic like addition and subtraction, but the quantities you're working with are often unknown â€” that's why they're represented by letters. You might remember solving algebra equations that look like this: a(b + c) = ab + ac. The letters a, b, and c all represent a number.</p></div></div>`;
