You may notice that some face creams use the word <i>visage</i> to try to sound fancier than they are.</p><p class="long">A famous use of <i>visage</i> is in Shakespeare's <i>Julius Caesar</i>. Brutus says: "O conspiracy/Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,/When evils are most free? O, then by day/Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough/To mask thy monstrous <i>visage</i>?" Now there's a quote that will help you remember the meaning of <i>visage</i>, and even give you nightmares.</p></div>`;
