Condescension is full of arrogant and snooty attitude, and people who practice condescension treat others like inferior idiots. Sarcasm goes well with condescension if you're trying to be a jerk. You can almost hear the word <i>descent</i> in <i>condescension</i>, so think of someone acting all high and mighty, looking down at everyone else.</p></div>`;
