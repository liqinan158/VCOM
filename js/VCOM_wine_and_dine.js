If you <i>wine and dine</i> someone, you usually take him out to dinner at a fancy restaurant.</p><p class="long">Historically, wining and dining someone was usually done with some ulterior motive â€” you might wine and dine a person you hoped to do business with, or a charming friend you wanted to ask on a date. The phrase's meaning is fairly obvious, since when you <i>wine and dine</i>, you provide someone with wine to drink and food on which to dine.</p></div>`;
