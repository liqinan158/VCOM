For example, the boycott was named after Charles C. Boycott. That makes Boycott an eponym, and <i>boycott</i> is also an eponym. Eponyms are the people who provide the names and the words that are formed from the names. St. Audrey is another eponym, because her name inspired the word <i>tawdry</i>.</p></div>`;
