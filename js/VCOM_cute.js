Things that are small or young are often described as <i>cute</i>, like babies, puppies, or toy fire engines.</p><p class="long">Something that’s cute is easy to like. We usually use <i>cute</i> to describe how something looks, like your cute smile or your cute dimples, but you can use it for anything that’s endearing or pleasing, like the boy-gets-girl ending to a romantic comedy. <i>Cute</i> can also refer to something that’s overly clever and a little bit fake.
