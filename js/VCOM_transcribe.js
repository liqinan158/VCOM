Speeches, interviews, and trials are often <i>transcribed</i> for records.</p><p class="long">From the Latin <i>transcribere</i>, which means “to copy, write over, or transfer,” the verb <i>transcribe</i> means just that: to write out a copy. You might want to transcribe a recording of an interview onto paper, or maybe you need to transcribe all the notes you collected from an important meeting. If you can remember that <i>trans</i> means “over” and that a <i>scribe</i> is a writer, you shouldn’t forget this word. Fun fact: to <i>transcribe</i> poorly is to <i>transcribble</i>.</p></div>`;
