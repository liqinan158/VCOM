A washcloth dipped in cold water and pressed onto your forehead to help you cool down is a type of <i>compress</i>.</p><p class="long">As a verb, <i>compress</i> means to squeeze together with a fair amount of pressure. When you compress a sponge to get all the water out, you press it between your palms or squish it between your fingers. <i>Compress</i> can also mean to make something more compact â€” as with the sponge, when you compress an object it gets smaller. You could even compress a speech by cutting it down into a shorter but equally effective version.</p></div>`;
