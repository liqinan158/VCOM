It's best to avoid operating speedboats or motorcycles when you're <i>somnolent</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Somnolent</i> comes from the Latin word <i>somnolentia</i>, meaning sleepiness, which in turn is from the Latin root <i>somnus</i>, for sleep. You can feel somnolent, or describe something as somnolent. As an adjective it describes something that is likely to induce sleep, like a boring movie in an overheated theater, or the low, somnolent lighting in a museum exhibit of fragile, old illuminated manuscripts.</p></div></div>`;
