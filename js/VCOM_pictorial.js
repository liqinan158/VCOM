A graphic novel is a <i>pictorial</i> way to tell a story.</p><p class="long">Years ago, a <i>pictorial</i> was the name for a magazine that had far more pictures than text, but today the word is mostly used to mean "illustrated." Many books for very young children are mainly pictorial, and you could call your grandparents' photo album a pictorial record of their life together. <i>Pictorial</i> comes from the Latin word <i>pictorius</i>, "of a painter," from <i>pingere</i>, "to paint."</p></div>`;
