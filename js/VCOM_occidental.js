The United States is an <i>occidental</i> country.</p><p class="long">The word <i>occidental</i> is uncommon these days, in part because it's historically been the opposite of <i>oriental</i>, a term for the Eastern countries of the world, mainly Asia â€” which has come to be considered offensive (or at least old-fashioned). You won't hurt anyone's feelings by describing Europe or Canada as <i>occidental</i>, though few people will know what you mean. The Latin root, <i>occidentem </i>, means "western sky" or "sunset."</p></div>`;
