Some people kill themselves by accident, but that’s not <i>suicide</i>, it’s just clumsy and unfortunate.</p><p class="long">The word <i>suicide</i> breaks down into the Latin words <i>sui</i> and <i>caedere</i>, which together translate to “kill oneself.”  However, not all suicides are about the final end of life.  For example, a righteous politician can commit political suicide by speaking publicly about an unpopular topic.  We call a person who has killed himself a <i>suicide</i>, and a police report might tell how many suicides happen in a city each year.</p></div>`;
