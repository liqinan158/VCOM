"A <i>clipped</i> lawn is better for croquet," she announced in <i>clipped</i> tones.</p><p class="long">While you can use <i>clipped</i> where you'd use words like "shorn" or "trimmed," it's more common for this adjective to describe a particular way of speaking. If someone talks in a slightly irritated, very direct way, using sharp, short sounds, their speech is clipped. You can hear the difference between your math teacher's laid back "Hey kids, have a seat!" and your gym teacher's clipped command, "Take a knee. Now."</p></div></div>`;
