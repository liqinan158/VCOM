Some people call their group of friends a <i>squad</i>, probably so they seem organized and tough.</p><p class="long">An army squad might focus on demolition or sharpshooting, while a police squad specializes in one particular type of crime â€” like a vice squad, battling drugs and illegal gambling, or a riot squad, controlling large groups of protesters. Any team of people is a squad, like a cheerleading squad or a squad of teenage graffiti artists. <i>Squad</i> comes from the Vulgar Latin <i>exquadra</i>, "square," or the shape infantry troops historically assembled in to fight.</p></div></div>`;
