You can watch <i>vaporization</i> when you boil a pot of water.</p><p class="long">Vaporization happens in two ways: evaporation and boiling. Evaporation occurs when sunlight shines on water until it changes to vapor and rises into the air. Boiling is the rapid vaporization of a liquidâ€”the steam that comes out of a boiling kettle is actually visible water vapor. <i>Vaporization</i> can be traced back to the Latin <i>vaporem</i>. "a warm exhalation" or "steam."</p></div></div>`;
