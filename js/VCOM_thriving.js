You have a <i>thriving</i> cupcake business if you can hardly bake enough to keep up with your customers' orders.</p><p class="long">Use the adjective <i>thriving</i> to describe something that's healthy — like your new puppy — or profitable and busy — like your dad's car dealership. A thriving Mexican food truck always has a long line in front of it, and a thriving publisher puts out many popular books. <i>Thriving</i> comes from the verb <i>thrive</i>, and its Old Norse root word, <i>þrifask</i>, which means both "thrive" and "grasp to oneself," from <i>þrifa</i>, "to clutch or grasp."</p></div></div>`;
