You might <i>vouchsafe</i> to your brother the secret to your key lime pie recipe.</p><p class="long">Because <i>vouchsafe</i> can mean making an offering in a gracious way, it’s sometimes used in reference to religious acts — you might vouchsafe your prayers unto God. <i>Vouchsafe</i> can also mean doing something in a condescending way, which makes it a word that's used in many of other contexts. For example, your fancy great aunt might vouchsafe to visit your dorm room. <i>Vouchsafe</i> comes from the Middle English expression “To vouch something safe on someone,” meaning you confer something in a way that's secure.</p></div></div>`;
