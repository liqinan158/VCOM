Hand fans are small enough to hold, and as you wave them back and forth, they send puffs of air over your hot face. To do this is to <i>fan</i> yourself. A completely different <i>fan</i> is the one who follows a sports team or a rock band devotedly: "The <i>fans</i> jumped to their feet and cheered."</p></div>`;
