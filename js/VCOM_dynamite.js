Builders and miners were happy about the new explosive, since dynamite was stronger and safer than those that came before it. Nobel named his invention <i>dynamit</i>, a Swedish version of the Greek <i>dynamis</i>, "power." The earliest figurative meaning was "dangerous," but in the 1960s it came to also mean "excellent" or "impressive."</p></div>`;
