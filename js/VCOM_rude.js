For example, children are taught to say "please" and "thank you" or they are considered rude. A rude person needs a little work — <i>rude</i> also means crude or basic, like a rude cabin out in the woods that barely keeps the rain out. It can be a sudden realization, too. If you wake up and see your breath, it's a rude awakening that the heat's not working.</p></div>`;
