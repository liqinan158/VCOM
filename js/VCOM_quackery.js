It's <i>quackery</i> when someone poses as a doctor.</p><p class="long">If a person fakes being a medical doctor, that's quackery. You can also call it quackery when a company sells an herb or supplement or diet aid that doesn't actually do anything. Some doctors feel that any alternative medicine is nothing but quackery, while others believe that some of these things — like meditation or acupuncture — really work for patients. <i>Quackery</i> is from the 1690's, from a Dutch root word, <i>quacksalver</i>, "hawker of salve."</p></div>`;
