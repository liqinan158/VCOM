Think of the game show "Jeopardy!," and how each column is a different <i>category</i> of questions â€” like "Literary Characters" or "Potent Potables."</p><p class="long">The noun <i>category</i> has the sense of ordering or sorting. In Biology, the science of taxonomy is all about categorizing all living organisms. It might be an easier task to categorize books in a library according to genre (e.g., fiction, non-fiction, mysteries, etc.) or to categorize the shoes in your closet according to season.</p></div></div>`;
