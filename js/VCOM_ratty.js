Your sister's pet ferret might make you jump when it peers out from behind the <i>ratty</i> old sofa with its <i>ratty</i> little eyes.</p><p class="long">If your attic is inhabited by a huge, multi-generational family of rats, it's <i>ratty</i> too. Whether this adjective is used to mean "looking like a rat," "full of rats," or "decrepit and dirty," it's negative. The same is generally true for <i>rat</i> itself, which refers to the rodent but also figuratively means "liar" or "traitor." The root of <i>rat</i> and <i>ratty</i> is unknown.</p></div>`;
