If King Tut could arrange it, so can you!</p><p class="long"><i>Sarcophagus</i> comes from the Greek word <i>sarkophagos</i> meaning "limestone used for coffins." But the Greek literally translates to mean "flesh-eating." Seems a bit gruesome, doesn't it? This translation makes sense when you figure that limestone was used in coffins because it quickly decomposed the body. These stone coffins are usually decorated with a sculpture or inscription and date back to the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Rome, and Greece.</p></div>`;
