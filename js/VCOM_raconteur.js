Who is the biggest <i>raconteur</i> in your group? He or she's the one who always tells the best stories â€” or jumps in when another storyteller isn't being vivid enough.</p><p class="long">Do you make going to the store to buy groceries a fascinating experience? Do you offer witty observations of the people you pass on the street? If so, you're a raconteur, someone who can regale his or her listeners with riveting stories, usually funny, sometimes dramatic. <i>Raconteur</i> comes from the French word "raconter,"  meaning "to recount."
