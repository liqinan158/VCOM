The only real difference between <i>super</i> and <i>superb</i> (besides the letter "b") is that something superb is surprisingly or especially excellent. A taco that tastes great might be super. But if it's among the very best tacos you've ever eaten, it's superb. Dinner tonight? Super! How was dinner? It was superb!</p></div></div>`;
