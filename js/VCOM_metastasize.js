Cancer cells are said to <i>metastasize</i> when they spread from one part of the body to another.</p><p class="long">A cancer patient dreads hearing the word <i>metastasize</i>, since it means that the malignant cells have spread through the body. Breast cancer cells are said to metastasize, for example, if they're found by a doctor in a patient's liver or brain. The process of this happening is known as <i>metastasis</i>. Both words come from the Late Latin <i>metastasis</i>, or "transition," with the Greek root word <i>metastasis</i>, "removal, migration, change, or revolution."</p></div>`;
