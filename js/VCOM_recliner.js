It's called a <i>recliner</i>.</p><p class="long">A recliner is a cozy chair that you could also call a <i>lounger</i>. Many people have recliners in their TV rooms or dens, for especially comfy viewing. The trick of a recliner is right there in its name, <i>recline</i>, or "lie back in a relaxed position," from the Latin <i>reclinare</i>, "to bend or lean back." Recliners have been around since the 1800s, the most famous being the La-Z-Boy recliner, which was patented in 1928.</p></div>`;
