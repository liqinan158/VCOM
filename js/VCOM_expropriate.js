If you really like your neighbor's house, you may wish you could <i>expropriate</i> the property.</p><p class="long">To correctly pronounce <i>expropriate</i>, say "ex-PRO-pree-ate." It sounds a lot like another verb, <i>appropriate</i> and has a similar meaning. That's because of their shared Latin root <i>proprius</i>, which means "own." <i>Expropriate</i> is typically used to describe taking property — rather than smaller possessions — and a government or other official organization is usually the one doing the taking. For example, a state may expropriate property in order to build a new road.</p></div>`;
