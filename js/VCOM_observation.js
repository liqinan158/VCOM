When you share an <i>observation</i>, you communicate an insight.</p><p class="long">The Latin verb <i>observƒÅre</i>, "to attend to," is the foundation for our word <i>observation</i>, which requires that you pay attention.  If a hospital holds you overnight for observation, they want to keep an eye on your condition.  If you have a lot of funny or interesting observations on a topic, maybe you should write a book.  Scouts founder Robert Baden-Powell once said, "If you make listening and observation your occupation you will gain much more than you can by talk."</p></div></div>`;
