If you tend to be a little cowardly, you're probably glad that people aren't expected to defend their honor with a <i>duel</i> these days.</p><p class="long">The classic definition of a <i>duel</i> is the kind that happens all the time in Shakespeare plays: two men clanking swords together in a battle to the death over some issue of honor or betrayal. Today, the word <i>duel</i> can be used to talk about any kind of contest or struggle â€” like a duel between political candidates. The word <i>duel</i> can be traced back to both <i>duo</i>, Latin for "two," and also <i>duellum</i>, which means "war."</p></div>`;
