Wealthy people living in grand houses once employed <i>handmaids</i> to clean for and serve them.</p><p class="long">You're most likely to come across the word <i>handmaid</i> in a book these days, since in-house "help" is more likely to be called a "cleaner," "housekeeper," or, rarely, a "maid." Years ago, handmaids were employed to work closely with their employers, sometimes as "ladies-in-waiting," assistants to queens and other royals. The term comes from <i>maid</i>, "young woman," and the "close-at-hand" sense of <i>hand</i>.</p></div></div>`;
