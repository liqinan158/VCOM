It sounds gross but feels really good. <i>Exfoliation</i> is the process of buffing off the outer layer of skin cells or shedding parts of a surface.</p><p class="long">Exfoliation often refers to something people have done at a spa, but it’s not just for humans. A tree's exfoliation involves its bark being peeled off or leaves falling off. You could also call a snake shedding its entire scaly skin exfoliation (though it's officially known as <i>ecdysis</i> or <i>shedding</i>). When a plant loses its leaves, it's exfoliation — this is appropriate since <i>exfoliation</i> stems from the Latin <i>exfoliare</i>, "to strip of leaves."</p></div>`;
