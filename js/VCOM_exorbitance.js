A salesman's <i>exorbitance</i> might make you wonder if he's exaggerating about the great deal he's offering.</p><p class="long">One kind of exorbitance is excessive spending, like when your grandmother spoils you by showering you with expensive gifts. The exorbitance of a writer or artist shows itself as eccentricity and often brilliant, odd work. <i>Exorbitance</i> comes from the adjective <i>exorbitant</i>, "unreasonably high," which was originally a legal term meaning "deviating from rule or principle." At its root is the Late Latin word <i>exorbitare</i>, "deviate" or "go off the track."</p></div>`;
