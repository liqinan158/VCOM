If you hit someone that's a physically assault, but if you say nasty things to him, it's a verbal assault. Sometimes we use <i>verbal</i> to mean "spoken instead of written," usually to talk about agreements we've made. A child who is verbal is a child who can speak, and we call someone who's very articulate a verbal person.</p></div></div>`;
