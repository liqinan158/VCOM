Your parents may need to <i>uproot</i> you if your mom gets a new job all the way across the country.</p><p class="long">One meaning of the verb <i>uproot</i> is "move," especially when a person is forced to move. Another way to use <i>uproot</i> is more literal: to pull a plant out of the ground, roots and all. You might, for example, uproot your favorite rose bush and replant it in a sunnier spot in your garden. Interestingly, the figurative sense of <i>uproot</i> is about a hundred years older than the literal meaning, which was first used in the late 1600's.</p></div></div>`;
