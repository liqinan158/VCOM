It can also refer to a "<i>baccalaureate</i> service," which is a like a farewell ceremony for graduating seniors from high school or college.</p><p class="long">You can “receive a <i>baccalaureate</i>” or you can “attend a <i>baccalaureate</i>.” If you receive a baccalaureate that means you have received a bachelor's degree for undergraduate studies in college. When you attend a baccalaureate, that means you are attending a ceremony celebrating graduating seniors. Traditionally, a baccalaureate was a religious service held the Sunday before graduation, but in modern times it doesn’t necessarily have a religious meaning.</p></div>`;
