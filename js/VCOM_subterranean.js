In fact, real things that are subterranean really are down low — underground, in fact. A subterranean worm lives under the earth's surface. A subterranean lair is a secret hideout dug under the dirt — or maybe it's just your basement. The word comes from the Latin <i>subterraneus,</i> from <i>sub</i> meaning "under" and <i>terra</i> meaning "earth."</p></div></div>`;
