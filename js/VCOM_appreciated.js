A slightly different meaning of <i>appreciated</i> is "received with gratitude," so your thank you note to your Aunt Emily could say, "The hand-knitted leg warmers were much <i>appreciated</i>!" And if someone talks about an appreciated stock, they mean that it has increased in value.</p></div></div>`;
