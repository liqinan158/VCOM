A <i>beetling</i> boulder behind your camp site projects out over it.</p><p class="long">You're most likely to encounter the adjective <i>beetling</i> describing the way someone's bushy eyebrows jut out over his eyes: "The professor was distinguished by his sharp voice and his <i>beetling</i> brows." The word comes from the somewhat old fashioned verb <i>beetle</i>, "project or overhang," which in turn comes from the now-obsolete <i>bitelbrouwed</i>, "grim-browed or sullen." The Old English root is <i>bitel</i>, "sharp or sharp-edged."</p></div></div>`;
