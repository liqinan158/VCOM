var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">landslide</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When dirt and rock from a mountainside coming sliding down, call it a <i>landslide</i>. Another kind of <i>landslide</i> takes place when one candidate soundly defeats another in an election. With either type of <i>landslide</i>, it's probably safest to stay out of the way!</p><p class="long">The political meaning of <i>landslide</i> is commonly used, but it's not the word's original definition. A geographical landslide occurs when a huge amount of earth slides down a slope or mountain, usually displacing rocks and vegetation and often houses and buildings as well. Landslides are caused by erosion, heavy rain, and earthquakes, among other events, and they're disruptive enough to give rise to the figurative meaning.</p></div>`;
