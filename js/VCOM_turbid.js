It’s usually used as a criticism — a <i>turbid</i> river is generally a polluted one, but then again a good pint of real ale should be <i>turbid</i>. Go figure.</p><p class="long"><i>Turbid</i> comes from the Latin word <i>turbidus</i>, which means "muddy, full of confusion." Although it’s usually used to describe liquid, like that turbid creek your rain boot disappeared in, it can also be used to describe writing that’s unclear. If your teacher says your essay for English is turbid, it’s time to go back to work! Outlines and thesis statements can help clear up turbid prose.</p></div>`;
