If one doctor says your severe blueberry allergy is cured, you might want a <i>consultation</i> with another doctor before indulging in the forbidden fruit.</p><p class="long">Stemming from the Latin word <i>consultationem</i>, which means to “consult, ask counsel of, or reflect,” a <i>consultation</i> usually involves a lot of questions and hopefully expert answers. Consultations happen before big decisions have to be made, such as talking with a realtor before buying a house or conferring with master yogi before attempting a head stand.</p></div></div>`;
