If you don't want to ride the roller coaster, you don't have to â€” don't let yourself be talked into it just because you're worried your friends will call you a <i>wimp</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Wimp</i> is an informal, derogatory way to refer to someone who's nervous or unadventurous, like calling them a "chicken" or "crybaby." And when you wimp out, you don't follow through on something because you're too scared: "I didn't mean to wimp out, but when I got up there, I changed my mind about bungee jumping." Experts aren't sure about the origin of <i>wimp</i> but think it may be connected to <i>whimper</i>, "cry softly and fearfully."</p></div></div>`;
