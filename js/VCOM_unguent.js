Whether it's a cream or a gel, the main purpose of an <i>unguent</i> is to heal or protect a sore.</p><p class="long"><i>Unguent</i> comes from the Latin <i>unguentum</i>, "ointment." Ancient unguents were luxurious and included fragrant oils used to anoint and perfume the skin. Some were even symbolically incorporated into religious ceremonies. In old-time of medicine shows, potions and unguents were sold as having magical properties but were usually concocted from common ingredients that could sometimes even be dangerous.</p></div></div>`;
