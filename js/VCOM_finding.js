If the dog digs up the hamster grave in the backyard, better not to share his <i>finding</i> with the neighbors.</p><p class="long">Findings are facts that have been found, especially by academics studying something. A dietary study could have the finding that more people are avoiding gluten. An economic study could have the finding that more people are working out of their home. An environmental study could have the finding that a type of toxin is increasing. A dogâ€™s finding would be a little less academic. The word is usually plural, because it usually refers to more than one thing found.</p></div></div>`;
