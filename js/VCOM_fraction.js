If two of you split the take from a bank heist, you would each get half. If you had a getaway driver, then the money would be split three ways, into <i>fractions</i> of one-third each.</p><p class="long">The quotient of two numbers is called a fraction, as is the action of performing division. Most of us, however, think of a fraction as a small part of an item â€” as in: "You only use a <i>fraction</i> of your actual brain power in the course of your life." Just think of a whole as a pie, and a fraction as a slice of that pie.</p></div></div>`;
