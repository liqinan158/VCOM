When you divide two numbers the answer is called the <i>quotient.</i> The <i>quotient</i> of six divided by two is three.</p><p class="long">Quotient comes from Latin and means "how many times." That makes a lot of sense: if you divide one number by a second, you are figuring out "how many times" the second number goes into the first. Outside of math, use of the word is restricted: the IQ test is short for "Intelligence Quotient," and very rarely you might hear someone ask, "What's my quotient of cupcakes?" when they mean "What is my share?"</p></div>`;
