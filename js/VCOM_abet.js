"The singer was <i>abetted</i> by a pianist in her rendition of <i>Silver Bells</i>," for example, is a harmless construction. However, people more often expect <i>abet</i> in a sentence like this: "She was charged with aiding and abetting the burglar because she drove the getaway car." <i>Abet</i> comes from an Old French word <i>abeter</i> meaning "to bait."</p></div></div>`;
