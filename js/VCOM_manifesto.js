If you feel you should be voted "Most Likely to Succeed," you could issue a <i>manifesto</i> describing all the reasons why you deserve to win.</p><p class="long"><i>Manifesto</i> comes from the Italian word of the same spelling, meaning "public declaration explaining past actions and announcing the motive for forthcoming ones." You'll most often hear about a manifesto that's been issued by a group, like a political party or government â€” for example, a set of new rules that an incoming regime is going to enforce. Though organizations are more likely to create a manifesto, it's also possible for an individual to issue one about more personal ideas.</p></div>`;
