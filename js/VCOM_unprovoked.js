A slap across your face is <i>unprovoked</i> if you did nothing to make the slapper mad at you.</p><p class="long">President Franklin D. Roosevelt famously described the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese, which brought the US into World War II, as "<i>unprovoked</i> and dastardly." A military action that isn't reacting against a previous attack is unprovoked, and a furious outburst from your friend is also unprovoked if you gave him no reason to be angry. <i>Unprovoked</i> comes from the verb <i>provoke</i>, to deliberately incite anger or annoyance in someone. The Latin root is <i>provocare</i>, "call forth or challenge."</p></div>`;
