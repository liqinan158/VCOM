You play a <i>clavichord</i> by pressing keys on a keyboard.</p><p class="long">A clavichord sounds similar to a piano but much softerâ€”for this reason, these instruments were most often used to compose and practice music rather than to perform it. During the late medieval period through the early 19th century, the clavichord was very popular, especially in Germany and Scandinavia. The word <i>clavichord</i> combines the Latin <i>clavis</i>, "a key," and <i>chorda</i>, "a string."</p></div></div>`;
