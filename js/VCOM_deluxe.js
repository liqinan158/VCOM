If you upgrade to a <i>deluxe</i> hotel room, it will be bigger, more luxurious, and probably have a great view.</p><p class="long">You're most likely to find <i>deluxe</i> describing a spa, hotel, car, or house. When any of these things is deluxe, it goes beyond the ordinary to provide a superior, luxurious experience. A deluxe home might have thousands of square feet and an in-ground pool, and a deluxe cruise probably includes a large berth and gourmet food. <i>Deluxe</i> comes from the French <i>de luxe</i>, "of luxury," from the Latin <i>luxe</i>, "excess or abundance."</p></div>`;
