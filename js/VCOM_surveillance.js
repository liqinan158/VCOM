All of which is a roundabout way of saying that if you are under <i>surveillance</i>, you are being closely watched â€” usually by the authorities, and usually not for a good reason! Those <i>surveillance</i> cameras in banks and stores are put there in the hopes of both preventing crimes and recognizing criminals after a crime has been committed.</p></div>`;
