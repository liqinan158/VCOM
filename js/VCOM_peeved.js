You've probably heard of "pet peeves," those particular annoyances that drive you crazy? <i>Peeved</i> is how you feel when faced with such annoyances, like tiny rocks in your shoe as you walk to school, terrible music in a restaurant, or a bad referee call against your favorite basketball team.</p></div>`;
