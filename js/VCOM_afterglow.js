You should look for the <i>afterglow</i> after you watch the sunset.</p><p class="long">While an afterglow is actually caused by dust in the atmosphere, the radiant, glowing effect in the sky is much more beautiful than this makes it sound. You can also use the word <i>afterglow</i> in a figurative way, to describe the way you feel after something really wonderful happens to you: "I basked in the <i>afterglow</i> that followed my successful opening night on Broadway."</p></div>`;
