So if you are a <i>quail</i>, you might <i>quail</i> at the thought of <i>quail</i>-hunting season.</p><p class="long"><i>Quail</i> is a broad, catchall word; it can refer to any one of many small domestic game birds.  So if youâ€™re bragging about the quail you shot on a hunting trip to your uptight, bird-obsessed pals, they might demand to know if it was the Bobwhite quail, the Valley quail or the Scaled quail, to name just a few. If you use this word as a verb, it means to draw back in fear or pain. You might quail in fear at the sight of a playground bully. A good way to remember this verb meaning is to think of how the word <i>chicken</i> is also associated with fear.</p></div>`;
