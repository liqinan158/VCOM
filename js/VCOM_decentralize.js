A bookstore chain might <i>decentralize</i> by shifting from one main buyer purchasing books for all the stores to individual store buyers making those purchases.</p><p class="long">In government, the term <i>decentralize</i> is used when authority moves away from federal control to the state â€” or from the state to a local level. Your state, for example, might decentralize laws about stores using plastic bags by allowing each city or town to make its own rules. In business, a company decentralizes when it gives more control to individual locations (like the freedom to hire workers and make rules), rather than making these decisions for them.</p></div></div>`;
