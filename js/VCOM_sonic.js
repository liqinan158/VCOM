If something goes faster than the speed of sound, it creates a <i>sonic</i> boom, a shock wave that sounds like an explosion.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>sonic</i> was coined in the 1920s, from the Latin <i>sonus</i>, or "sound." Ever since, it's been used not only to describe things relating to sound, but also things that travel as fast as sound. The Sonic fast food chain originally advertised "Service With the Speed of Sound." A super-fast Japanese express train is called Sonic. And the Sonic the Hedgehog video games feature a speedy main character.</p></div>`;
