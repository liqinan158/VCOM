That's a good way to remember that a <i>sector</i> is a specific part of society or the economy, made up of similar elements — like the health care <i>sector</i> or the education <i>sector</i>.</p><p class="long">Our most common use of the word <i>sector</i> refers to a society’s divisions. For example, our economy is divided into the private sector (privately-owned interests) and the public sector (government). Other than that, the word also has many technical applications in math and science. From the Latin verb <i>secare</i>, "to cut," <i>sector</i> was applied long ago to math as a section of a circle, which carried through to military language as "a circle around a headquarters."</p></div>`;
