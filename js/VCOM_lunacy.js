Your mom might yell, "It's <i>lunacy</i> to go out in the snow wearing those flip flops!"</p><p class="long">Some people use the noun <i>lunacy</i> when they talk about actual mental instability, although this is considered old fashioned and outdated. It's much more common to describe the lunacy of someone who does something ridiculous or foolish. While adopting a cat from the animal shelter might be a great idea, adopting all thirty cats from the shelter would be lunacy. <i>Lunacy</i> comes from <i>lunatic</i>, originally "affected with periodic insanity, dependent on phases of the moon."</p></div></div>`;
