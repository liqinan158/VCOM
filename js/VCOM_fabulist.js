Your uncle who spends holiday gatherings telling stories that end with clear morals is a <i>fabulist</i>, and so is your cousin who invents long, complicated excuses for being late to school every morning.</p><p class="long">Someone who writes or recites fables — moralistic tales that often feature animals as characters — is one kind of fabulist. The ancient Greek fabulist Aesop, for example, composed many stories about talking animals that ended with important moral lessons. Another kind of fabulist is a person who tells tall tales, or who lies. The root of <i>fabulist</i> is the Old French <i>fable</i>, "lie or pretense," from the Latin <i>fabula</i>, "story, play, or tale," or literally, "that which is told."</p></div></div>`;
