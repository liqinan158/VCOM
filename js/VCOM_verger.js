A <i>verger</i> can also lead religious ceremonies, in a behind-the-scenes kind of way.</p><p class="long">The term <i>verger</i> usually refers to a member of an Anglican church who takes on extra duties, planning details of services and sometimes participating in religious processions. The word <i>verger</i> comes from the ceremonial staff or rod that the verger carries during these processions â€” in Old French, a <i>verge</i> is a "twig, branch, or wand of office." The word stems from the Latin <i>virga</i>, "shoot, rod, or slender stick."</p></div>`;
