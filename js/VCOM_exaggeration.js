If you have a dog and a hamster, it would be an <i>exaggeration</i> to describe yourself as "practically Doctor Dolittle," living in a house full of animals.</p><p class="long">When you make something showier, or more noticeable than normal, that's also called <i>exaggeration</i>. The exaggeration of your hand movements might be necessary on stage so the audience can see them, but in real life it just looks silly. <i>Exaggeration</i> comes from the Latin word <i>exaggerare</i>, which means to magnify or to heap or pile on.</p></div>`;
