If you accidentally spill coffee all over your sister's favorite sweater, you might worry that she's going to <i>castigate</i> you as soon as she finds out.</p><p class="long"><i>Castigate</i> means punish, and punish harshly, but the punishment is always a severe scolding. Sometimes it means criticize severely. Politicians in the Senate are always castigating each other for their alliances and opinions. <i>Castigate</i> and <i>chasten</i>, which also means "to reprimand" but is less severe, share the Latin root <i>castus</i> which means "pure." Ideally, if you castigate someone, you mean to guide someone away from the wrong path and toward a more pure one. But it sure doesn't feel like that when you're being castigated!</p></div>`;
