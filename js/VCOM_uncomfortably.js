If the chairs in a parent-teacher conference are all sized for kindergartners, the parents and teachers will sit <i>uncomfortably</i> through the meeting.</p><p class="long">If you're too close to the movie screen, you'll have to crane your neck uncomfortably, and if you have very long legs and take a lengthy airplane flight, you'll spend it bent uncomfortably into your seat. In addition to physical discomfort, there's another kind of unease that lends itself to this adverb: "They were so mad at each other that everyone sat uncomfortably, in complete silence, all the way through dinner."</p></div>`;
