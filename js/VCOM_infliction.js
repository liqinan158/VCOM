The <i>infliction</i> of pain on a little kid who needs to get a shot is not fun for him or for his parents.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>infliction</i> is good for talking about imposing something negative on someone. You might describe a bully's actions against a smaller child as including both the infliction of pain and the infliction of fear. The Latin root of <i>infliction</i> is <i>inflictionem</i>, or "a striking against," from <i>inflictus</i>, "to strike or dash against." It's important not to confuse <i>infliction</i> with <i>affliction</i>, which means "something that causes pain," but isn't done on purpose.</p></div></div>`;
