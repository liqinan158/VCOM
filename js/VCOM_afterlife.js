Many cultures and religions have a concept of an <i>afterlife</i>.  Otherwise, much of humanity would be quite uneasy.</p><p class="long">In Eastern religions, there is a notion of “karma” or even of “nirvana,” where, after a person dies, reincarnation takes the soul to a more elevated form of life.  The Judeo-Christian tradition trusts in “heaven”; the ancient Egyptians buried precious belongings with their dead to accompany them to the afterlife. Regardless of origin, most religions want people to believe that life doesn't stop when your pulse does.</p></div>`;
