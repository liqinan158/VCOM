If you <i>vouch</i> for your brother, you're saying he's a stand-up type of guy.</p><p class="long">First used in the 14th century, <i>vouch</i> comes from the Latin <i>vocitare,</i> ("to call, call upon, or summon"). Sometimes it can mean offering supporting evidence, as when, for example, you're summoned to court to testify on someone's behalf. If you write a letter of recommendation for a student or co-worker, you vouch for their character and abilities. If you take out a student loan, the government will automatically vouch for you, that is, they'll guarantee the loan will be repaid.</p></div></div>`;
