If you ask a hairdresser to color your hair <i>auburn</i>, you'll be disappointed to end up with bright red curls.</p><p class="long"><i>Auburn</i> almost always describes hair color â€” you might talk about your favorite childhood doll's long auburn hair, for example. The earliest meaning of <i>auburn</i> was "yellowish-white," not "reddish-brown," from the Medieval Latin <i>alburnus</i>, "off-white" or "whitish," from the Latin <i>albus</i>, or "white." In the 16th century it was influenced by the Middle English word <i>brun</i>, "brown," and the meaning changed.</p></div>`;
