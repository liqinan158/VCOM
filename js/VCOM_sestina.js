It will take you a while to write a <i>sestina</i> for English class — you'd better start writing!</p><p class="long">The form of a sestina is so complicated it can feel like a math problem to compose one. Sestinas have a total of 39 lines — six six-line stanzas followed by a three-line envoi, or brief stanza. The last word of every line is repeated in a specific pattern, so the six words are rotated through the endings of every single line. The earliest sestinas were composed in the medieval language of Occitan, during the 12th century.</p></div>`;
