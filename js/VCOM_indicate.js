If you feel sick during a car trip, you can <i>indicate</i> this to the driver by groaning loudly or announcing "I'm going to be sick!"</p><p class="long">Scientists rely on data from experiments to indicate whether their theories are correct. <i>Indicate</i> can also describe a symptom or signal of something else. For example, a stock market recovery could <i>indicate</i> growing public confidence â€” or foolishness, depending on which expert you ask. The verb <i>indicate</i> comes from the noun <i>indication</i>, which in turn comes from the Latin word <i>indicare</i>, meaning "something that points out or shows."</p></div></div>`;
