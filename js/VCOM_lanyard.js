Reporters often wear a <i>lanyard</i> with a badge that reads "Press."</p><p class="long">If you've attended summer camp on a university campus or gotten a backstage pass to a rock concert, you've probably worn a lanyard around your neck that identified what you were doing there. Doctors and nurses in hospitals often wear these identification lanyards, and so do people at conventions and workers in prisons. Smaller lanyards hold keys, whistles, or flash drives. The original lanyards were nautical, used to raise the sails on a sailboat.</p></div></div>`;
