It can also describe something that happens because something else is going to happen later — like that <i>anticipatory</i> excitement you feel the night before a big party.</p><p class="long">Anything anticipatory has to do with realizing something beforehand, or anticipating. It’s related to the feelings you get while waiting and preparing for something. Sometimes the worst part of being sick isn’t the feeling itself, but the anticipatory anxiety about getting sick again. It’s not the same as a sixth sense, but Spiderman’s spidey sense is anticipatory because it alerts him to future danger.</p></div>`;
