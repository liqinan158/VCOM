You look up at the steep, sharp wall of rock above you and realize you are seeing an <i>escarpment</i>. At this moment, you can truly appreciate the power of natural erosion.</p><p class="long">The history of the word <i>escarpment</i> can be found in the Italian <i>scarpa</i> and the French verb <i>escarper</i>, meaning "to make into a steep slope." This became the noun referring to a natural cliff, usually found where the land forms shift from highlands to a low plateau, with the sharp slope of an escarpment dividing the two landscapes. The word was also applied to a non-natural protective barrier usually built up in front of castles or forts.</p></div>`;
