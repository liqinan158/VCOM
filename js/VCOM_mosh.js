Fans of music like hardcore punk and thrash metal often <i>mosh</i> at live shows.</p><p class="long">Concert-goers first began to mosh in the early 1980s while listening to bands play loud, aggressive hardcore and punk music. A "<i>mosh</i> pit" is the area near the stage where fans dance crazily. It became more common to mosh when grunge gained popularity in the late 80s. This verb was first spelled <i>mash</i>, but pronounced <i>mosh</i> â€” probably thanks to the lead singer of the band Bad Brains, who encouraged crowds to "mash it up" in his Jamaican accent.</p></div></div>`;
