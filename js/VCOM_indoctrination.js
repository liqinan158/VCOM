Your sister's orientation at her new job might seem more like <i>indoctrination</i> if she comes home robotically reciting her corporate employee handbook.</p><p class="long"><i>Indoctrination</i> often refers to religious ideas, when you're talking about a religious environment that doesn't let you question or criticize those beliefs. The Latin word for "teach," <i>doctrina</i> is the root of <i>indoctrinate</i>, and originally that's just what it meant. By the 1830s it came to mean the act of forcing ideas and opinions on someone who isn't allowed to question them.</p></div>`;
