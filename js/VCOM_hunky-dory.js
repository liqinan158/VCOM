Once you've started your new job and rented a lovely apartment, you might feel that life in a new city is <i>hunky-dory</i>.</p><p class="long">The informal <i>hunky-dory</i> is perfect for those times when everything is great, going according to plan, or not bad at all. This American-coined adjective has been around since the 1860s, from the now-obsolete <i>hunkey</i>, "all right," which stems from the New York slang <i>hunk</i>, "in a safe position," and the Dutch root <i>honk</i> or "home." The origin of <i>dory</i> is unknown.</p></div>`;
