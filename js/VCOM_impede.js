Carrying six heavy bags will <i>impede</i> your progress if you're trying to walk across town in a hurry.</p><p class="long"><i>Impede</i> comes from the Latin <i>impedire</i> which literally means "to hold the feet," formed from the prefix <i>in-,</i> ("in") plus <i>pes</i> ("foot"). Think about walking with a cast on your foot — how slow and awkward that would be. If you struggle with reading, that might impede your progress in your social studies class. An <i>impediment</i> is something that impedes, such as a physical defect that affects speech — a speech impediment.</p></div></div>`;
