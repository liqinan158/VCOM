You might aim to impress on the first day of school by wearing a lot of <i>bling</i>.</p><p class="long">There's an implication in the very term <i>bling</i> that not only do you have flashy chains and watches, but you want to show them off. The word itself comes from the idea that light glinting off gold or diamonds would make a <i>bling</i>-like sound if you could hear it. Both <i>bling</i> and <i>bling-bling</i> are US rap slang which gained mainstream popularity around the mid-1990s.</p></div>`;
