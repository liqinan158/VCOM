But we more often use the word to describe sabotage or the act of weakening someone else's efforts.</p><p class="long">Originally spelled with a ‘y’ instead of an ‘i’, <i>undermine</i> has Germanic roots and means "to weaken, hinder, or impair." Accidentally undermine the foundation of a house by digging a tunnel to China beneath it and you might be forgiven. Undermine your teacher’s authority by speaking out of turn and throwing spitballs and odds are you’ll get in trouble.</p></div></div>`;
