Being a great proofreader requires <i>fastidiousness</i>.</p><p class="long">Taken too far, fastidiousness can mean you worry and obsess over every little detail â€” or every tiny crumb or stain on your shirt. But having a degree of fastidiousness means you pay attention to details and do your work with great care. The source of this word is the Latin <i>fastidiosus</i>, "exacting," but also "squeamish," from <i>fastidium</i>, "squeamishness, dislike, or aversion."</p></div></div>`;
