If you have an uncle who is a <i>bigot</i> and tells racist jokes at Thanksgiving, you may need to talk to him and tell him it's not okay.</p><p class="long">A <i>bigot</i> can also be someone who refuses to accept other ideas, as in politics. This word was borrowed from Middle French, but the French word is of uncertain origin. In Old French <i>bigot</i> was a term of abuse for Normans, and possibly related to the oath <i>bi got</i> "by God." In English and French, a <i>bigot</i> was originally a hypocrite, a person who claims to have certain moral beliefs but whose behavior doesn't match those beliefs. A <i>bigot</i> was specifically a hypocritical professor of religion, but the connection with the current sense of <i>bigot</i> is not clear.</p></div>`;
