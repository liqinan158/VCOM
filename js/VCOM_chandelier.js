Walk into a grand ballroom and see a light fixture adorned with sparkling crystals? That's a <i>chandelier</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>chandelier</i> comes from the French <i>candere</i> meaning "be white, glisten." Look up at a chandelier and you'll see it glistening and casting white reflections on the walls. The French origin of the word might call up images of palaces like Versailles in France, where chandeliers hang in nearly every room.</p></div>`;
