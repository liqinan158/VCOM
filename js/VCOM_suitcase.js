If you're going on a week-long vacation, you should probably pack a <i>suitcase</i> to bring with you. Don't forget your toothbrush!</p><p class="long">If your suitcase is large enough, you'll have to check it when you fly on an airplane â€” you can carry only small suitcases into the cabin of the plane. These days most suitcases have wheels so you can roll them along behind you as you walk through a bus station or down the sidewalk. The earliest suitcases were sewn from wool, linen, or leather, often covering a wooden frame. Today, most suitcases are made of nylon or lightweight metal.</p></div>`;
