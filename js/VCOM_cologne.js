When you get dressed up for a night on the town, you might be sure to put some <i>cologne</i> on your neck.</p><p class="long">Both men and women wear cologne, which is scented with extracts or oils in a base of alcohol and water. Cologne is considered a kind of toilet water, which is less concentrated than perfume â€” and can be applied more liberally. If you've ever stood in an elevator with a man wearing an excessive amount of cologne, you know there can be too much of a good thing. The word is from the French <i>eau de Cologne</i>, "water from Cologne (Germany)."</p></div></div>`;
