It might hurt your grandfather's feelings if you refer to him as a <i>geezer</i>, since he thinks of himself as being youthful.</p><p class="long">Use the word <i>geezer</i> when you need an informal, slightly rude word for "wacky old man." If you're in the UK, you can call any man, whatever age he is, a geezer, but in the US it's specifically an old guy. The root of <i>geezer</i> is the now-obsolete Cockney word <i>guiser</i>, which means "mummer," or "masked mime or actor.</p></div>`;
