Many people <i>routinely</i> brush their teeth before they go to bed and again when they wake up in the morning.</p><p class="long">Something that's become a habit or an often repeated series of actions is done routinely. Your actual daily routine is one example of this â€” you might routinely eat cereal for breakfast, or routinely feed your cat at 5:00, for example. You can also say that a movie critic who always seems to find some fault with a film routinely trashes all your favorite movies. The French root is <i>routine</i>, "usual course of action," from <i>route</i>, "way or path."</p></div>`;
