After years of <i>disuse</i>, you won't be surprised when your dad's motorcycle doesn't start.</p><p class="long">The word <i>disuse</i> implies at least a bit of neglect, and it can also mean that something has become obsolete or old-fashioned: "Typewriters fell into <i>disuse</i> after personal computers became available." You'll often find the word used in the graceful phrase "fall into <i>disuse</i>." The word comes from a Latin root, <i>dis</i>, which means "lack of," added to the word <i>use</i>, and it's been around since about 1400.</p></div></div>`;
