var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">steady</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The adjective <i>steady</i> describes something that is firmly fixed in position. If you have to climb up on your roof, you definitely want to have a <i>steady</i> ladder. Otherwise, you risk ending up in the bushes instead of on the roof.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>steady</i> can also describe something that isn't going to fluctuate wildly. If you have a steady income from a salary, you bring in approximately the same amount of money each month. If you are paid on commission, on the other hand, you may make Midas look poor in some months and beggars look rich in others. As a verb, <i>to steady</i> means "to make something steady" (big surprise): You can steady a wobbly table by sticking a matchbook under its shortest leg, or you could steady a nervous dog with a reassuring pat.</p></div></div>`;
