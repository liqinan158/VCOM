You may have a big pile of white tube socks, but that wouldn't qualify as a <i>multiplicity</i>. You'd have a <i>multiplicity</i> of socks if you've got not just the white tube socks, but striped knee socks for soccer, black silk socks to wear with your tuxedo, wool hiking socks, low tennis socks with pom-poms on the back, and socks with little pockets for your toes.</p></div>`;
