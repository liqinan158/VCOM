The noun <i>equanimity</i> was borrowed from Latin <i>aequanimitƒÅs</i>, from <i>aequanimus</i> "even-tempered, fair," formed from <i>aequus</i> "even, level, equal" plus <i>animus</i> "mind." The archaic phrase <i>to bear with equal mind</i> means "to bear with a calm mind," and is a translation from the Latin. The phrase <i>a level mind</i> also refers to calmness. A near synonym is <i>composure</i>.</p></div></div>`;
