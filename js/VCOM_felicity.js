Sitting on the roof with a telescope and iced tea on a clear, starry night is one way to find perfect <i>felicity</i> — a happy place.</p><p class="long"><i>Felicity</i> comes from the Latin <i>fēlīcitās,</i> meaning "happiness." A synonym for <i>felicity</i> is "blissfulness." People, places, and things can have felicity: "His personality was so warm and full of felicity that we felt at ease the minute we met him." Or you can be in a state of felicity: "A full stomach, a fluffy couch, and the felicity of a Sunday-afternoon nap."</p></div>`;
