The child's face is red and streaked with tears, and he or she is gasping from crying so hard. This poor little boy or girl is sobbing uncontrollably. Sometimes, while trying not to cry, you might let out a single sob. A "<i>sob</i> story" is a story meant to make you feel bad for someone, so bad you might sob for them.</p></div>`;
