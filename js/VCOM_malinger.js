If you ever claimed to have a stomach ache in order to stay home from school, you know what it means to <i>malinger</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>malinger</i> comes from the French <i>malingre</i>, which can mean "ailing or sickly," but its exact origin is uncertain. One theory says that <i>mal</i>, or "wrongly," suggests the sick person is just faking. Lying about a stomach ache, holding the thermometer near a light bulb, refusing to get out of bed, moaning â€” these are classic tactics of those who malinger, or pretend to be too sick to do anything but lie around the house.</p></div>`;
