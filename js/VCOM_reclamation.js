Most people involved in reclamation want to reclaim something out of a sense of moral or environmental duty. Since <i>re-</i> means "again," it makes sense that a reclamation involves restoring something to its former glory, especially something that has gone to the dogs. Anything that's fallen on hard times is a good candidate for reclamation.</p></div></div>`;
