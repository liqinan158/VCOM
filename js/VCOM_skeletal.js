A skeletal stray dog has probably been living on the streets for a long time. This word is also used figuratively to describe something that has not yet been "fleshed out" â€” like a skeletal staff or crew that operates without a lot of support. The root of <i>skeletal</i> is the Greek <i>skeleton</i>, "dried-up body, mummy, or skeleton."</p></div>`;
