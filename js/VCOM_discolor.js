Your teeth might discolor from drinking too much black tea, and you might notice your beach towel discoloring after a summer spent at the seaside. The word <i>discolor</i> has been in use since the fourteenth century, and it comes from the Old French <i>descolorer</i>, with <i>colorer</i> meaning "to color."</p></div>`;
