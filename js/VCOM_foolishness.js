Throwing a temper tantrum because the lunch line is moving slowly is pure <i>foolishness</i> â€” your outburst won't make the line move any faster.</p><p class="long">When your actions show a lack of good sense or solid judgement, you're betraying your foolishness. Impulsively jumping off the garage roof into a pile of leaves is evidence of your foolishness. We can trace this word's origin back to <i>fool</i> and the Old French <i>fol</i>, "idiot," and also "blacksmith's bellows," from a root meaning "blow or swell."</p></div></div>`;
