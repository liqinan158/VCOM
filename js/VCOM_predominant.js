If the <i>predominant</i> feeling in a neighborhood is that pizza is the best food, the result might be pizzerias being the <i>predominant</i> type of restaurant there.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>predominant</i> describes a person or thing with great power or influence, or something that is prevalent. It comes from the Latin prefix <i>prae-</i>, “before,” and <i>dominari</i>, “to rule.” For example, because so many people like hip-hop, it might be the predominant music heard at a school dance. And that neighborhood with all the pizzerias? Teenagers are the predominant customers, and pepperoni is the predominant topping.</p></div>`;
