var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">employed</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Someone who's <i>employed</i> has a job or is busy with something. Some people believe that <i>employed</i> teenagers get themselves in less trouble than those without jobs.</p><p class="long">If you're working, you're employed. Most employed people work traditional full-time jobs, although an increasing number of them are freelancers or have part-time positions. Another way to use this adjective is to mean "used," as when you say, "The <i>employed</i> methods for keeping the classroom calm seem a little extreme to me." The adjective <i>employed</i> comes from the related verb, <i>employ</i>, "use, apply, occupy, or hire."</p></div></div>`;
