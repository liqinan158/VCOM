var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">acme</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When something is at the very peak of perfection, reach for this noun from Greek: <i>acme</i>. A brilliant violinist might reach the <i>acme</i> of her career, but eventually she might become unstrung.</p><p class="long">This noun referring to the highest point of something might sound comical because it has shown up so often in cartoons as the name of a company, such as the one that makes Wile E. Coyote's contraptions in the old Warner Brothers cartoons. But the word is actually a serious-minded import from Greek. Near synonyms for high points include <i>zenith</i>, <i>summit</i>, <i>pinnacle</i>, <i>apex</i>, and <i>peak</i>, but <i>acme</i> has a special nuance for an ultimate point of perfection.</p></div>`;
