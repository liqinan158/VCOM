Make sure your <i>enunciation</i> is clear when ordering in a restaurant so you don’t get roasted lamb when you really wanted toast with jam.</p><p class="long"><i>Enunciation</i> is from the Latin word <i>enuntiationem</i>, meaning “declaration.” Enunciation is more than pronouncing words clearly; it’s expressing them well, too. No one would mutter a declaration! People with excellent enunciation (also known as diction) are likely to end up broadcasters, announcers, actors, or in other jobs that require public speaking. Politicians need to have good enunciation. People who mumble or speak too quickly have poor enunciation: it's hard to understand them, because their words slur together.</p></div>`;
