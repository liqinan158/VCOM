If you refuse to eat, read, wear, or discuss anything that wasn't made in your own country, people might accuse you of <i>jingoism</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Jingoism</i> comes from the word <i>jingo</i>, the nickname for a group of British people who always wanted to go to war to prove the superiority of Britain. Now we use <i>jingoism</i> for that kind of aggressive, chauvinistic behavior in any country, or for things intended to stir up war-thirst and blind patriotism. If you see a TV show tries to get viewers to support a military cause without a critical look at whether war is necessary, call it jingoism.</p></div>`;
