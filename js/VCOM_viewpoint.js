Itâ€™s literally your point of view! To stop arguing with someone, try to see things from their <i>viewpoint</i> so you can kiss and make up.</p><p class="long">Use <i>viewpoint</i> to talk about a person's individual attitude about things. A parent, for example, often has a different viewpoint about bedtime than a child does. Conflicts in politics come up due to differing viewpoints on issues like taxes, welfare, and defense. Another way to say <i>viewpoint</i> is "point of view." The earliest meaning of <i>viewpoint</i> was in the physical sense, as when you stand on the roof of a building to get a great viewpoint of the city.</p></div></div>`;
