There's nothing like a good night's sleep to <i>vitalize</i> a tired child.</p><p class="long">You can use the verb <i>vitalize</i> to describe what happens when you become energized or perked up: "My tai chi class isn't great exercise, but it does <i>vitalize</i> me." A much more common, and related, word is <i>revitalize</i>. For some reason, <i>vitalize</i> is rarely used, although it's much older, first used in the 1670's, while <i>revitalize</i> didn't come into use until 1858 â€” almost two hundred years later.</p></div>`;
