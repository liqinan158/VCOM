It's also a type of happiness: if you're full of <i>buoyancy</i>, your mood is light and happy.</p><p class="long">This is a word with two main meanings that fit together well: Both kinds of <i>buoyancy</i> have to do with floating and staying up. The physical kind refers to objects that float instead of sinking in water, like a life raft or a <i>buoy</i>. The other kind of buoyancy is a happy mood, a feeling that nothing can get you down. So whenever you run into the word <i>buoyancy</i>, just think "staying afloat."</p></div></div>`;
