var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">vituperative</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the adjective <i>vituperative</i> to describe criticism that's so sharp it hurts. A <i>vituperative</i> review of a movie would make the director bitter for months.</p><p class="long">To correctly pronounce <i>vituperative</i>, remember that the first vowel sound is the long <i>i</i> sound, and the second syllable is accented: "vie-TOO-per-uh-tive." Being vituperative takes criticism to the next level. Vituperative criticism is harsh, scathing, even abusive. If a review or assessment is vituperative, it doesn't say "try harder next time." Instead it gives the sense of "go away and never come back."</p></div></div>`;
