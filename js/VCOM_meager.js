Your mother may only allow you a <i>meager</i> serving of chocolate cake, and you may need to eat a <i>meager</i> serving of veggies in order to deserve that dessert.</p><p class="long"><i>Meager</i> doesn't mean adequate — it means not enough. People with a limited supply of food may try to subsist on meager portions. People who make a meager amount of money probably have a hard time making rent. <i>Meager</i> and <i>emaciated</i> both derive from the Old French <i>maigre</i>. If you can remember that you will look emaciated if your diet is meager, you’ll use the word correctly.</p></div>`;
