It's <i>derived</i> from a solution of roses boiled with toothpicks.</p><p class="long">The word <i>derive</i> <i>derives</i> from (see how we did that?) the Latin <i>rivus</i> or stream, as in water. That image of the stream may help you remember the meaning of <i>derive</i>; you may picture tracing tiny streams back to their main source. <i>Derive</i> is a verb, as you can see, but it's often in the news in the noun form <i>derivative</i>: something that is <i>derived</i> from something else, as in "juice is a derivative of an orange."</p></div></div>`;
