This can also be a verb, as in "The mama poodle <i>whelped</i> six <i>whelps</i>."</p><p class="long">To someone who studies animals, <i>whelp</i> is just the word for a newborn dog or for birthing. Besides applying to canines such as wolves and coyotes, <i>whelp</i> is sometimes used to describe a young person. This usually isn't a compliment. If an older person calls a young person a whelp or says, "I don't know what's wrong with you whelps these days!", you can be sure they're not impressed by youngsters.</p></div>`;
