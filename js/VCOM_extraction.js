For example, when the dentist yanks out your rotten tooth, the <i>extraction</i> is complete!</p><p class="long">In addition to this wince-inducing meaning, the noun <i>extraction</i> is the process of separating out something from a chemical mixture or compound. Take decaffeinated coffee â€” the caffeine is removed by extraction, so you've got science to thank for not being jittery after breakfast. <i>Extraction</i> can also refer to your family background. If you are of Greek extraction, for example, your family history can be traced back to Greece.</p></div></div>`;
