If you're confused about all those vowels, blame the French, because the word comes from the French words <i>lieu</i>, meaning "place," and <i>tenant</i> meaning "holding." A lieutenant is someone who holds the place of authority for the person who really has it. If you start a super secret club, you should choose someone to be the lieutenant who can run meetings when you're not there.</p></div></div>`;
