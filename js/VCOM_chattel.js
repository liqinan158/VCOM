It was once used to describe slaves and cattle, which is why referring to something or someone as <i>chattel</i> isn't very nice â€” you're essentially saying they're just property, somehow less than human. Despite the fact that <i>chattel</i> is an outdated word these days, it's probably still safe to call your bottle cap collection worthless chattel.</p></div></div>`;
