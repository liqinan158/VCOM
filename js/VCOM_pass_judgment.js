If you're overly critical of your sister, you probably tend to <i>pass judgment</i> on every little move she makes.</p><p class="long">The worst thing about people who pass judgment on others is that they tend to act morally superior, as if they're in a position to judge the actions of other people. In fact, the original meaning of <i>pass judgment</i> is a courtroom judge making a legal decision, or — literally — judging. The source of this term is <i>judgment</i>, originally "action of trying at law," from the Latin <i>iudicare</i>, "to examine officially."</p></div>`;
