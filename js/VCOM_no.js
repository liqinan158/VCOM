And, the response, "<i>No</i>, thanks" when you offer your friend half of your liverwurst sandwich means that she is really not interested. You might vote no on a special ballot question about extending school to Saturdays or exclaim, "Oh <i>no</i>!" to express disappointment when your team loses a big game. <i>No</i> comes from the Old English negative, <i>na</i>.</p></div></div>`;
