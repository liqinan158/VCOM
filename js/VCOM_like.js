Or, in giving an example, <i>like</i> is the go-to word to introduce it: "We enjoy sports like hockey." <i>Like</i> also can mean "enjoy" or "favor." We can see this in the word's origin, the Old English <i>lician</i>, meaning “be pleasing.” The speech pattern of saying "like" incessantly doesn't, like, mean anything.</p></div></div>`;
