Most <i>jackknives</i> are compact enough to fit in a pocket, but we don't suggest your taking one to school.</p><p class="long">Another name for a jackknife is a <i>pocketknife</i>. Some jackknives have several different blades, all of which fold tidily (and safely) into the body of the knife, while others unfold to reveal a single blade. The bend of a jackknife inspired the name of the dive also called the <i>jackknife</i>, in which the diver's body folds into a <i>V</i> shape and then straightens out before the diver hits the water.</p></div>`;
