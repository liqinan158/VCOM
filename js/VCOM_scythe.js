While farmers use it to cut plants, the grim reaper uses it to, well, scare you to death.</p><p class="long">In Old English, <i>scythe</i> was spelled <i>siðe</i>. Since there is no longer an <i>ð</i> in modern English, <i>scythe</i> became the accepted form of the word in the early 15th century. It drew its <i>sc</i>- start from the Latin <i>scissor</i>, meaning “carver, cutter.” Farmers use these tools to slice and trim grass and other plant stalks. Napoleon Bonaparte once noted that “Occupation is the <i>scythe</i> of time,” meaning that work mows down or diminishes time.</p></div></div>`;
