You could feel socially <i>awkward</i>, like when you forget the host's name. Or, you may feel physically <i>awkward</i>, like when you trip on your way to the podium.</p><p class="long">Have you ever felt clumsy and that you had two left feet? That is how it is to feel awkward â€” literally that you are going in the wrong direction. <i>Awkward</i> is an example of a word literally meaning something and then figuratively meaning something related. Its Middle English roots are <i>awke</i>, meaning "backhanded," and <i>-ward</i>, to "go in the direction of." So, if you are feeling uncomfortable, or clumsy, it's probably because your hands are connected to you the wrong way!</p></div></div>`;
