Because an <i>unswerving</i> person or thing never turns aside, the word is also commonly used to describe steadfast loyalty, like a dog's <i>unswerving</i> devotion to its master.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>unswerving</i> often describes loyalty. Your best friend's unswerving loyalty to you, for example, feels secure and dependable — you know she'll always be there for you. You can also use the word more literally, when you talk about something moving in a straight, unswerving line, never making a turn or detour. The verb <i>swerve</i> is at the root of <i>unswerving</i> — originally, it meant "to depart," but by the fourteenth century its meaning was "to deviate from a straight course."</p></div></div>`;
