You might prefer your vanilla ice cream topped with <i>caramel</i>.</p><p class="long">Caramel can be used in many ways â€” to flavor foods, pour on top of desserts, or form into a soft, chewy candy. You can also use the word to describe the milky brown color itself: "She's the one with the long, <i>caramel</i> colored hair." In French, <i>caramel</i> means "burnt sugar," which comes from the Latin <i>cannamellis</i>, a combination of <i>canna</i>, "cane," and <i>mel</i>, "honey."</p></div>`;
