That leaves the <i>dodeca-</i> part, which means 12. A dodecagon is a polygon, just like a pentagon (five sides) and a hectogon (100 sides). The Greek roots make 12 by combining <i>do</i> (2) and <i>deca</i> (10). This combination of roots can also be found in <i>dodecaphonism</i> (musical composition using the 12-tone technique) and <i>dodecastyle</i> (having 12 columns on a side, which describes certain antique architecture).</p></div>`;
