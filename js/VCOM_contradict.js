var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">contradict</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">"Contra-" usually means "against," and to <i>contradict</i> is to go against or say the opposite of what someone else is doing or saying. Sometimes to <i>contradict</i> is to frustrate with words, like when one person says "The sky is blue" and another says "No, it's azure."</p><p class="long">Denying or distorting the truth is a big part of trying to <i>contradict.</i> It can be harmless verbal back-and-forth, like when a husband and wife disagree just to disagree, or contradict each other to make a humorous point, but at other times people contradict something to make another person look like a liar. Often, a person who has lied will later contradict himself by saying something different from what he said earlier â€” and sometimes the two sides contradict each other, and neither is actually right.</p></div></div>`;
