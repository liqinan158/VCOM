Yum.</p><p class="long">A good omelet is a little bit fluffy, but firm enough to contain its filling. You cook an omelet by whisking eggs with a bit of water or milk and cooking them quickly over high heat without stirring. You can then fold the omelet in half to serve it. While the French word <i>omelette</i> was first used in the 1600s, the omelet itself may be more than two hundred years older than that. The Latin root, <i>lamella</i>, means "thin plate."</p></div>`;
