It's always a messy scene when a political debate slips into <i>vituperation</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Vituperation</i> is from the Latin root words <i>vitium</i>, meaning "a fault or defect," and <i>parare</i>, meaning provide, which combined to make <i>vituperare</i> meaning "disparage." <i>Vituperation</i> can also be used to refer to feelings of bitter resentment and deep-seated antipathy toward another â€” like your vituperation toward the meter maid who just placed that ticket on your windshield.</p></div>`;
