Your <i>doting</i> grandmother, for example, might shower you with gifts even when it's not your birthday.</p><p class="long">If someone you know adores you beyond all reason, only seeing your good points and completely disregarding your faults, they're <i>doting</i>. Your doting uncle might offer to fly you to Disney World for spring break, and your doting older sister might wake up early to make your favorite breakfast when you visit her. The earliest meaning of <i>dote</i> was "be feeble-minded from old age," and by the 15th century it came to mean "be loving or infatuated."</p></div>`;
