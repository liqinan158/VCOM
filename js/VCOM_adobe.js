In hot, dry climates like the American Southwest, Africa, and Spain, you'll often see buildings made of adobe. The word <i>adobe</i> can also refer to the material that these bricks are made of. The clay, water, and straw that go into the material give the bricks a natural-looking, informal appearance.</p></div>`;
