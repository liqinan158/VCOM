Your constant <i>peevishness</i> might make it difficult for you to make friends.</p><p class="long">If you're having one of those days when everything seems to irritate you, what you're feeling is peevishness. It's easy to criticize other people's peevishness — like when your sister snaps at you for chewing gum loudly and criticizes the way you eat your food — but everyone experiences it from time to time. <i>Peevishness</i> comes from the adjective <i>peevish</i>, and its origins are a bit uncertain. What is known is that the Old English root, <i>peyvesshe</i>, means "perverse, foolish, spiteful, or insane."</p></div>`;
