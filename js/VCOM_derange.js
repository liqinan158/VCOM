Going without sleep for an entire week can <i>derange</i> a person.</p><p class="long">It's more common to see the adjective <i>deranged</i> — or insane — than the verb <i>derange</i>, but you can use it to describe what happens when someone or something drives a person batty. Too many head injuries can derange a football player's short term memory, and a teasing cat just out of reach might derange a tied-up dog in a yard. The Old French root of <i>derange</i> is <i>desrengier</i>, "throw into disorder," which combines <i>des</i>, "do the opposite of" and <i>rengier</i>, "put into line."</p></div>`;
