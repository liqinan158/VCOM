Think of teaching "the whole child," and you have the idea behind <i>gestalt</i>.</p><p class="long">The perception of oneness from many is the basis of <i>gestalt</i>. It derived from the 1890 German philosophy of <i>Gestaltqualit√§t</i>, meaning "form or shape," which explored the idea of perception. For example, a picture might have several separate parts that work together to form one perceived image. The area of <i>gestalt</i> psychology developed in 1912, focusing on the various aspects of a person and how they combine into a whole that affects that person's relationship with his or her environment.</p></div></div>`;
