Your piano teacher might tell you to play a piece <i>andante</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>andante</i>, particularly common in classical music, is sometimes described as "at a walking pace." An andante movement in a symphony is faster than <i>adagio</i> but slower than <i>allegro</i>. Like so many musical words describing tempo, <i>andante</i> is Italian, a form of the verb <i>andare</i>, "to go." The Latin root, <i>ambire</i>, means "to go around" or "to go about."</p></div>`;
