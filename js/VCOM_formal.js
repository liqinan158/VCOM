If you're invited to the White House, you'll want to make a good impression, so it's a good idea to adopt a generally <i>formal</i> demeanor. No jeans or trash talking allowed.</p><p class="long">In our casual world, there are still many times we need to be formal, like at weddings or funerals.  Adopting a formal manner — i.e., dressing up and not eating with your hands — will help you make a good impression on job interviewers or future in-laws.
