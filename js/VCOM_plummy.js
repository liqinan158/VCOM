Imagine someone sipping from a glass of wine, describing its plummy notes. In Britain, it's used far more often as an informal way to say "very desirable," like an actor's plummy role in a new movie, or "upper class," like your wealthy cousin's plummy accent. It's also applied to sounds that are rich and full.</p></div>`;
