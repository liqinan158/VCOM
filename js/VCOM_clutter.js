The disorganized <i>clutter</i> of shoes, hats, shirts, belts, jackets, and pants makes it impossible to find a thing in your closet!</p><p class="long"><i>Clutter</i> can describe all those disorderly random things in your purse, but it can also refer to the random echoes that show up on a radar screen. The echos mix with other desired signals and can make it hard to track everything. As a verb, <i>clutter</i> is what you do when you fill up a space with a crazy mix of objects. You may clutter up the attic when you finally clean out that closet!</p></div>`;
