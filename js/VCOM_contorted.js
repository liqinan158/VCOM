If your face is <i>contorted</i> with frustration as you build a model sailboat, you’re furrowing your brows and wrinkling your nose — and should probably find a new hobby.</p><p class="long">Things can be physically contorted, like a twisting mountain trail, or figuratively contorted, like a biased magazine article. A story can get contorted as well. The more times you tell people the tale of your bike crash, the more it changes, until in the end you're telling a pretty contorted version in which the bike is a motorcycle and the lamp post is a pack of rabid dogs.</p></div></div>`;
