It’s the opposite of <i>forward</i>. If you stop peddling your bike on a hill, you’ll start rolling <i>backward</i>. If you count <i>backward</i> from 10 to 1, you probably just hypnotized someone.</p><p class="long">When you go backward, you move in reverse. You might give a backward glance at a person as you walk away. <i>Backward</i> also means "slow," or "behind the times," as in a backward government that doesn't allow girls to go to school. If you wear your clothes backward, then you’re dressing like Kris Kross, the hip-hop duo from the 90s. The Old English roots are <i>on bæc</i>, "back," and <i>-weard</i>, "toward." <i>Backwards</i> (with an “s”) is primarily British usage.</p></div></div>`;
