When you go on a picnic, be sure to have a bag for the <i>disposal</i> of your trash afterward, or you will be a terrible litterbug.</p><p class="long">You can use a garbage disposal, a grinder in your sink drain that allows you to wash down certain waste items without causing clogs, for the disposal of vegetable scraps. In addition to meaning "getting rid of something," <i>disposal</i> can also mean "the power or means to accomplish something."
