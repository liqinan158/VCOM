Or people can be ignorant of specific types of information. In fact, we all are. For example, most of us are ignorant of the particulars of nuclear physics and ignorant about what it takes to be an astronaut. Sometimes people are also labeled <i>ignorant</i> if they are rude, inconsiderate, or narrow-minded.</p></div></div>`;
