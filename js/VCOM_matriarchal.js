A group or society is <i>matriarchal</i> when it is run by women.</p><p class="long">Anthropologists use the adjective <i>matriarchal</i> to talk about societies that are headed by females. The word comes from the Greek <i>matÄ“r</i>, "mother," and <i>archein</i>, "to rule." The term <i>matriarchal</i> arose as a balance to the traditional patriarchal, male-ruled, concept of society, although feminists and anthropologists often use it to describe societies in which women have equal rights, as well as families or tribes headed by mothers or grandmothers.</p></div></div>`;
