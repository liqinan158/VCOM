This is a kind of strength.</p><p class="long">If you bend a fork and it bends right back â€” that's resiliency. A car that is in an accident only has a few scratches has resiliency: it holds up and keeps its shape. A car that was demolished didn't have much resiliency. A person shows resiliency if they are able to recover from a difficult experience. Going back to school after a horrible event like a parent dying shows a lot of resiliency. Doing a triathlon shows physical resiliency.</p></div></div>`;
