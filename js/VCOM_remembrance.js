It's the process of remembering things that happened in the past. In Shakespeare's play "Hamlet," the character of Ophelia famously says, "There's rosemary, that's for <i>remembrance</i>." The smell of the herb has actually been shown to improve memory, and has historically been a symbol of remembrance. Early uses of <i>remembrance</i> had the meaning "keepsake or souvenir."</p></div>`;
