A <i>procrastinator</i> is likely to leave all the Christmas shopping until December 24th.</p><p class="long"><i>Procrastinator</i> comes from the Latin verb <i>procrastinare</i>, which means deferred until tomorrow. The prefix <i>pro</i> means forward, and <i>crastinus</i> means of or belonging to tomorrow. If you've always been known in your family as a procrastinator, your sister has probably gotten used to receiving her birthday card at Christmas time and her Christmas present in July.</p></div>`;
