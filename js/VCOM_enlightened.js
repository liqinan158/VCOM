If your answer is yes, then congratulations! You were <i>enlightened</i> or in possession of a clear understanding of what was otherwise mysterious.</p><p class="long">The word <i>enlightened</i> comes from the Latin prefix <i>en</i> meaning "in, into" and the word <i>lux</i> meaning "light." Combine these meanings — "into the light" — and you're describing what it is that characterizes an enlightened person: a sense of clarity and understanding. People often seek to be enlightened spiritually, by taking pilgrimages, meditating, or looking to spiritual gurus like the Dalai Lama.</p></div></div>`;
