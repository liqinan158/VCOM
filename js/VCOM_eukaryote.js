The genetic material and information of a <i>eukaryote</i> is contained within this nucleus.</p><p class="long">Eukaryotes vary from single-celled organisms to complex multicellular animals and plants. In fact, most living things are eukaryotes, made up of cells with distinct nuclei and chromosomes that contain their DNA. The only organisms that aren't eukaryotes are bacteria and archaea, known as prokaryotes. The word <i>eukaryote</i> comes from the Greek <i>eu</i>, "well," and <i>karyon</i>, "nut or kernel," which is a common scientific word-forming element that's used to talk about the nuclei of cells.</p></div>`;
