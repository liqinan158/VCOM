If your opinion <i>diverges</i> from mine, we do not agree. To <i>diverge</i> means to move apart or be separate.</p><p class="long">The poet, Robert Frost, wrote: "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I -/ I took the one less traveled by / And that has made all the difference." The word <i>diverge</i> in the poem carries both the meaning of separating and of being apart from the main. As a poet, it was Frost's job to use words properly. Here he does not diverge from this role.</p></div>`;
