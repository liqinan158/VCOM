A promise of a lollipop can <i>induce</i> a toddler to do just about anything, even sit down and be polite to Aunt Edna. Older kids need something more substantial.</p><p class="long">Some people believe that if you offer someone a large enough sum of money, you could <i>induce</i> them to do almost anything. But a movie heroine might say to the villain, "Nothing could <i>induce</i> me to marry you. Not all the money in the world. Not if you were the last man on Earth!" <i>Induce</i> also means to stimulate the occurrence of something, such as medications used to induce vomiting, or to induce a pregnant woman to go into labor.</p></div>`;
