When something <i>snaps</i>, it breaks or separates suddenly, often with a cracking sound. A <i>snap</i> can also be a fastener on clothes. And if you like a song, you can <i>snap</i> your fingers to the beat or <i>snap</i> a selfie of yourself dancing.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>snap</i> is useful for many things that make a similar sharp sound, like when you snap your lunchbox shut, snap your fingers, or snap a whip. An animal's quick, strong bite is also a snap. As a noun, it can mean "fastener" or "the sound of a snap." A snap judgment is a decision you make almost instantaneously, and a cold snap is a short period of bitter weather.</p></div>`;
