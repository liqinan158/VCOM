If someone asks you to help move a couch on a Saturday when you have tickets to a game, that's an <i>inconvenient</i> request.</p><p class="long">If you have to go to the bathroom very badly just as a test is starting, that's inconvenient. If the movie projector breaks in the middle of a movie, that's inconvenient. Other times, things are inconvenient just because they're kind of a pain.
