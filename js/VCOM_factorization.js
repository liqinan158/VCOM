For example, factorization of the number 12 might look like 3 times 4. You can break that down even further using prime factorization, when you reduce a number to prime factors. In this case, 12 can be factorized to 3 times 2 times 2. The word <i>factorization</i> comes from <i>factor</i>, which has had a mathematical meaning since the 1600s.</p></div>`;
