Your dad's <i>famed</i> brownies are the highlight of every bake sale in town.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>famed</i> basically means "renowned." In other words, something that's famed is famous, usually for its excellence. If a book is famed, it's either a bestseller or a classic, and if your English teacher is famed, it's probably hard to get into her classes because everyone wants to take them. The 16th century meaning of <i>famed</i> was "much talked about," from the now-obsolete verb <i>fame</i>, "spread abroad or report."</p></div></div>`;
