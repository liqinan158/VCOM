Your <i>unconvincing</i> story about being abducted by aliens probably won't persuade your teacher to give you an extension on your term paper.</p><p class="long">Your unconvincing impersonation of President Ronald Reagan might sound more like John Wayne, and an unconvincing alibi won't get a suspect off the hook if a detective thinks she's guilty. The adjective <i>unconvincing</i> comes from <i>convince</i>, "cause to believe in the truth of something," and its root that means "to conquer." If you haven't convinced someone of some fact or truth, you've been unconvincing.</p></div></div>`;
