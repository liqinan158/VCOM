Your <i>raffish</i> classmate might constantly play mean practical jokes, always denying responsibility with a charming smile.</p><p class="long">If you're raffish, you're a "rake" or a "cad." Though you're pretty much bad news, you pull off your dastardly deeds in an attractive manner. Someone with a raffish look is intriguing as well as disreputable. <i>Raffish</i> comes from <i>riff-raff</i>, "generally undesirable people," from the Medieval French <i>rifle et rafle</i>, "stealing from the bodies of the dead on the battlefield."</p></div>`;
