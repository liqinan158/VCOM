Perhaps the most famous theorist was Albert Einstein, whose theory of relativity is arguably the most famous ever presented. Still, an idea can always be disputed until proven, and theorists are often scoffed at. Einstein himself once said, "No one but a theorist believes his theory; everyone puts faith in a laboratory result but the experimenter himself."</p></div></div>`;
