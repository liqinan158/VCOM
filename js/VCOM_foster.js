A teacher could <i>foster</i> creativity by providing crayons to every student. You can also <i>foster</i> a child, which means the child lives in your home for a time.</p><p class="long">You may have seen photos of a cat taking care of a baby rabbit, or a pig nursing a litter of puppies: those are little <i>foster</i> families. <i>Foster</i> can be a verb (to <i>foster</i> someone or something) or an adjective used to describe a <i>foster</i> family, child, or parent. The word is from the Old English <i>fostrian</i> meaning "to supply with food, nourish, support," which sounds like what those mama hogs were doing. Unlike <i>adopt</i>, <i>foster</i> has a time limit.</p></div></div>`;
