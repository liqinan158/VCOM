You might meet <i>sporadically</i> with your cousins, usually on minor holidays like Memorial Day or Flag Day.</p><p class="long"><i>Sporadically</i> comes from the Greek word <i>sporadikos</i>, meaning scattered, with the root word <i>spora</i>, which means sowing. Imagine sowing seed by scattering it, and you'll get the hit-or-miss sense of <i>sporadically</i>. There is no pattern to the frequency of an event that occurs sporadically. Working sporadically is hard because you lack a steady income and never know when you'll be busy, but traveling sporadically can be fun.</p></div></div>`;
