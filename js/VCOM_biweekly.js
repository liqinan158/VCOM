Or twice a week. Just to confuse you.</p><p class="long">In the publishing world, this word is straightforward: a biweekly magazine comes out once every two weeks. But once you step outside magazines and newspapers, it gets a little more confusing. People use this word to describe things that happen once every two weeks, which is officially correct. They also use it to describe things that happen twice in one week, which is kind of correct â€” but the word <i>semiweekly</i> is more accurate in that case.</p></div>`;
