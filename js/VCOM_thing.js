You might describe your sister's bizarre outfit by saying, "She was wearing this puffy orange <i>thing</i> around her waist and a tall, feathered <i>thing</i> on her head."</p><p class="long">If you can't name something or don't want to for some reason, you can use the word <i>thing</i> instead. You can also use it to talk about an action, as in "You did the right <i>thing</i> when you got lost," or a quality, like "your favorite <i>thing</i> about parties is spending time with your friends." The phrase "do your <i>thing</i>," which is associated with the 1960s, was actually first used in the 1840s to mean "follow your particular predilection."</p></div>`;
