In a lunar eclipse, the edge of the earth's shadow — the part that isn't fully dark — is its penumbra. Sun spots also have a penumbra, the outer edge that's not quite as dark as the center. The word comes from the Latin root <i>umbra</i>, which means "shadow." The <i>pen</i> part means "almost," so a penumbra is "almost shadow."</p></div></div>`;
