Painters of religious art often put a <i>halo</i> around the heads of angels and saints.</p><p class="long">A halo is a symbol of holiness, represented by a circle or arc of light around the head of a saint or holy person. Any circle of light can be described as a halo, even in a non-religious context; sometimes you'll see a glowing halo of light around the moon, for example. The word <i>halo</i> also means "glory or majesty," a symbolic halo rather than a physical one. The Greek <i>halos</i> means "ring of light around the sun or moon."</p></div>`;
