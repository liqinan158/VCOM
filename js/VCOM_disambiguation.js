var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">disambiguation</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Disambiguation</i> refers to the removal of ambiguity by making something clear. <i>Disambiguation</i> narrows down the meaning of words and it's a good thing.</p><p class="long">This word makes sense if you break it down. <i>Dis</i> means "not," <i>ambiguous</i> means "unclear," and the ending <i>-tion</i> makes it a noun. So disambiguation is the act of making something clear. Disambiguation distinguishes between different meanings of words. If you say the word <i>joker</i>, do you mean a playing card, a prankster, or a Batman villain? Disambiguation will clear things up. If you mention that you were playing poker, then it's clear which joker you're talking about. When you see the word <i>disambiguation</i>, think "clearing up confusion."</p></div></div>`;
