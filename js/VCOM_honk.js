A goose's <i>honk</i> can be a greeting or warning, which is also true of a car horn's <i>honk</i>.</p><p class="long">To make the sound of a honk is to honk, whether you're a goose or a taxi driver waiting for the light to turn green. The "cry of a goose" meaning is the oldest, and the word <i>honk</i>, especially if you say it loudly, sounds just like what it means. HONK! The most common honk these days comes from cars stuck in traffic or saying hello. Honk if you like definitions!</p></div>`;
