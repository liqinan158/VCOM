An artist might <i>mottle</i> a canvas by dripping splotches of paint on it.</p><p class="long">You can also use <i>mottle</i> as a noun, for a patchy arrangement of color or light: "The dog's fur was a <i>mottle</i> of brown and black." The adjective <i>mottled</i> is more common than <i>mottle</i> for describing things marked with spots or blotches, and both words come from <i>motley</i>, which today means "mismatched" but was originally defined as "multicolored."</p></div>`;
