This works because a dirigible is like a big hard balloon filled with lighter-than-air gas, such as helium or hydrogen. You've probably seen dirigibles used in advertising, like the Goodyear blimp. A famous dirigible accident was the Hindenburg crash. The rock band Led Zeppelin was going to be called Led Dirigible, but it just didn't sound as cool. Just kidding.</p></div>`;
