Well, that in a nutshell is a <i>gourmand</i>. <i>Gourmand</i> is not to be confused with <i>gourmet.</i> A gourmet is a connoisseur of good food who enjoys eating but doesn't do so to excess. A gourmet might find himself full in his favorite restaurant, but he would never explode. Both words are from the Medieval French term <i>gourmant</i>, meaning "glutton."</p></div>`;
