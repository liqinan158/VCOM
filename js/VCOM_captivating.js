You might find a marathon of episodes of a TV show so <i>captivating</i> that you forget to eat dinner.</p><p class="long">When people are captivating, they're often very intelligent, attractive, charming, or otherwise fascinating. Something that catches and holds your interest is captivating, like a captivating mystery novel you just can't put down. In fact, this adjective comes from the Latin <i>captivatus</i>, "to take or capture," and early in its use, <i>captivating</i> had that literal meaning. Now it's only used to mean capturing interest.</p></div></div>`;
