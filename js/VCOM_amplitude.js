If people compliment the <i>amplitude</i> of emotion in your poetry, it means you put much emotion into what you write.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>amplitude</i> describes the depth, breadth, or magnitude of something â€” in other words, how big or full it is. It comes from the Latin <i>amplus</i>, "large, spacious." You can admire the amplitude of your favorite teacher's intelligence or try to guess the amplitude of a snow storm. In physics, amplitude is a change in oscillation or vibration, and in math it's the angle made with the positive horizontal axis by the vector representation of a complex number.</p></div></div>`;
