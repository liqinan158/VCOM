You do your brother's <i>bidding</i> when he asks you to bring him his shoes and you comply.</p><p class="long">Doing your boss's bidding is usually part of a job description, although doing your cousin's or boyfriend's bidding usually isn't required â€” at least, it shouldn't be. When you are invited to eat at a friend's house, you might have to watch a slide show from his trip to Hawaii after dinner at his bidding. <i>Bidding</i> stems from the verb <i>bid</i>, with its Old English root of <i>biddan</i>, "ask, entreat, beseech, or order."</p></div>`;
