A <i>carillon</i> is a simply a set of bells in a tower.</p><p class="long">The Old French ancestor of this word is <i>carignon</i>. The <i>car</i> part of this word traces back to the Latin word for four, so a <i>carignon</i> was a set of four bells. Today, however, a carillon can have many many bells. Though you might picture someone playing it by pulling giant strings one after another, it is usually played by a keyboard that controls the bells. Some play automatically, with notes etched into a metal roll like you might find on a player piano.</p></div>`;
