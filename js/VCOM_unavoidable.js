Going to your family reunion is <i>unavoidable</i> if there's no way for you to get out of it.</p><p class="long">Obligations are unavoidable, since they are responsibilities that have to be honored. Letting your grandmother pinch your cheek is unavoidable, and paying your rent is also unavoidable. As you get older, it's unavoidable that your knees will get stiffer â€” there is no way to avoid having this happen.  <i>Unavoidable</i> comes from the verb <i>avoid</i>, which is rooted in the Anglo-French <i>avoider</i>, "to clear out or withdraw oneself."</p></div></div>`;
