You might feel <i>apathy</i> for the political process after watching candidates bicker tediously with one another.</p><p class="long">Although <i>apathy</i> is a lazy-sounding word indicating a lack of interest, action, or emotion, it has traveled through many languages to arrive in English. From the Greek <i>apatheia</i>, "freedom from suffering" or "impassibility," <i>apathy</i> has existed in English since the 17th century. Not just one person, but a whole segment of the population can be accused of inaction or emotional detachment: the expressions <i>voter apathy, student apathy,</i> and <i>consumer apathy</i> show just how unenthusiastic groups of people can be.</p></div>`;
