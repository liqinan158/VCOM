You might sensibly decide not to jump off a rope swing into a river until you've determined how deep the water is. Or you could sensibly choose not to debate politics with your hotheaded uncle. <i>Sensibly</i> comes from the Late Latin <i>sensibilis</i>, originally defined as "perceptible by the senses" and later also meaning "reasonable."</p></div>`;
