When you're talking casually with friends, you can also call a place that's small or dumpy a <i>hole</i>, like a rundown town or a really tiny apartment.</p><p class="long">The word <i>hole</i> comes from the Old English <i>hol</i> meaning "cave" which in prehistoric times wasn't just a dark space to hide, it was a home. The word <i>hole</i> is used in many contexts from a rabbit hole where rabbits live to "a <i>hole</i> in one" — the golf term. And, if you're feeling sick or depressed, you can hole up in your room — hiding away from the world, watching TV for hours.</p></div></div>`;
