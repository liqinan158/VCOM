It takes <i>athleticism</i> to run marathons, play pro football, or sprint down a cobblestone street in high heels without falling.</p><p class="long">Athleticism might get you a basketball scholarship to college or help you win most of the tennis matches you play. When you're particularly good at a sport, people will praise your athleticism. Although it’s usually used with sports, athleticism can describe any quality of strength and energy. It takes musical athleticism to play Ravel’s <i>Gaspard de la nuit</i> on piano. The word is rooted in the Greek <i>athlētēs</i>, "prizefighter or contestant in the games."</p></div></div>`;
