The <i>fleur-de-lis</i> is based on the shape of a lily.</p><p class="long">In French, <i>fleur-de-lis</i> means "lily flower" or "flower of the iris." It's been used for centuries to represent a vast variety of things, including royalty, French cultural heritage, Christianity, light, defense, and female virtue. Its closest association is probably the French monarchy and its coats of arms â€” the fleur-de-lis has gone on to appear on flags, in college and sports team logos, and in many religious works of art.</p></div>`;
