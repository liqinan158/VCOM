The word <i>rancorous</i> can be traced back to the Latin word <i>rancere</i>, which means "to stink." This in turn led to <i>rancorem</i>, "bitterness or rancidness." When you speak to your arch enemy and your words are so angry and bitter that they almost stink, go ahead and describe them as <i>rancorous</i>.</p></div></div>`;
