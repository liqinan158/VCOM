If you have a fireplace in your house, you might have a <i>bellows</i> too.</p><p class="long">The kind of bellows that provides extra oxygen to a dwindling fire is similar to other types of bellows: they all involve a bag of air. Various instruments use a bellows, to provide a constant flow of air. Accordions, some organs, and bagpipes all have this kind of bellows. In the 13th century, the word was <i>belwes</i>, literally "bags," from the Old English <i>belg</i>, "bag or purse."</p></div>`;
