No matter how smart you are, though, you must have big muscles to have <i>brawn</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>brawn</i> is from the Old French word <i>braon</i>, which means “fleshy or muscular part,” referring to a part of an animal that people cook and eat. British English still uses <i>brawn</i> to mean meat, headcheese in particular. In American English, <i>brawn</i> refers to strength and heft. You may also have heard the adjective <i>brawny</i>, meaning strong and muscular.</p></div></div>`;
