Whether it be Simba in "The Lion King," who wants to avenge his father's death, or Erin Brockovich, who seeks to avenge the suffering caused by a crooked and polluting California power company. One trick to remembering the word is that it's similar to the word <i>revenge</i>, which is the thing you're going for when you're seeking to avenge a bad deed. Watch for the <i>venge</i> in both words, and you'll know you're in the right department.</p></div>`;
