Do you see anything near you that resembles a bundle of dynamite sticks with a <i>fuse</i> burning down? If so, stop reading this and GET OUT OF HERE!</p><p class="long">Figuratively, if you say that someone has a short fuse, it means they get angry easily. If someone gets so angry they lose their temper, you can say that they blew a fuse. But this comes from another meaning of <i>fuse</i> — a device that interrupts the flow of electrical current so the system doesn’t get overloaded. If you use the toaster, microwave and dishwasher at the same time, you might literally blow a fuse. As a verb, if two things fuse, they blend or stick together.</p></div>`;
