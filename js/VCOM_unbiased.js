var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">unbiased</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To be <i>unbiased</i>, you have to be 100% fair — you can't have a favorite, or opinions that would color your judgment. For example, to make things as <i>unbiased</i> as possible, judges of an art contest didn't see the artists' names or the names of their schools and hometowns.</p><p class="long">You are unbiased if you can assess situations with a completely open mind. The root of <i>unbiased</i> is <i>bias</i>, which probably comes from the Greek word <i>epikarsios</i>, meaning “athwart,” “crosswise,” or “oblique.” When you have a bias, you look at the situation “from the side,” such as the side of someone who personally hates seafood telling you that Lobster Larry's is a terrible restaurant. To be unbiased you don't have biases affecting you; you are impartial and would probably make a good judge.</p></div>`;
