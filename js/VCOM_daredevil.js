Then you're a <i>daredevil</i>, someone who is recklessly adventurous.</p><p class="long">A daredevil loves adventure and excitement and tends not to think much about the safety or wisdom of their actions. The man who walked on a wire between the towers of the World Trade Center was a daredevil, and the woman who was the first to ride a barrel over Niagara Falls was also a daredevil. This word is also used as another name for a stunt performer who attempts risky tricks in front of a live audience.</p></div>`;
