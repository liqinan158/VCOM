If you’re battling armed zombies, remember that the <i>breech</i> is in the rear. Speaking of rears, in a <i>breech</i> birth, a baby comes out feet, or rear, first.</p><p class="long">Guns or rifles can either be loaded from the back part — called the breech — or from the front — called the muzzle. Most modern guns are loaded from the breech end. And if you’re single-handedly fighting a zombie army, you’d better hope your weapon is breech-loading; it’s much safer and faster to load a gun from the breech.</p></div></div>`;
