The most common usage of bluff is as a verb meaning to pretend. If you <i>bluff</i> at cards, you are pretending to have a better hand than you do.</p><p class="long">Many a good crime story ends with a <i>bluff</i>â€”"I've already contacted the police and they're on their way," the detective will say when that is not at all the case. The expression "calling your <i>bluff</i>" comes from poker, where you "call" a game to see someone's actual cards. Calling someone's bluff means forcing them to admit the truth.</p></div>`;
