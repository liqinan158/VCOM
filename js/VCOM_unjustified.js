You’re probably familiar with the prefix <i>un-</i>, which here means “not.” And <i>justified</i> contains <i>just</i>, meaning “fair.” So something that's unjustified is not fair or not right, such as an unjustified action like damaging someone's property or the unjustified praise for someone who has taken credit for another person's efforts.</p></div></div>`;
