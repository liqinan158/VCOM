var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">self-conscious</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the adjective <i>self-conscious</i> to describe someone who is ill at ease or uncomfortable with himself. A <i>self-conscious</i> person might worry about how he looks or whether he's saying the right things.</p><p class="long">Being self-conscious goes beyond just being aware of yourself â€” when you're self-conscious, you constantly question the way you appear to others. You might feel self-conscious when you stand in front of a group to give a speech, or when you're trying out for a movie or a play. The word first meant "conscious of one's own action" when it emerged in the 1680's, and by 1830's it had come to mean "preoccupied with one's own personality."</p></div>`;
