On a long car trip, after you run out of school gossip, you and your friends might <i>philosophize</i> on the nature of man, or the question "What is beauty?"</p><p class="long">To <i>philosophize</i> is not exactly the same thing as doing <i>philosophy</i>. Often if we say someone is philosophizing, we are kind of making fun of him, as if all of the sudden he thinks he’s Socrates, but really he’s just parroting Dr. Phil. If you stop driving in the middle of the road to tell your friend a revelation you’ve just had about the nature of suburban society, she might say, “Stop <i>philosophizing</i> and drive!”</p></div></div>`;
