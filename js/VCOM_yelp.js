var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">yelp</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>yelp</i> is a loud cry of pain, like what you’d hear after you step on a dog’s tail by accident.  It was an accident, right?</p><p class="long">The root of <i>yelp</i> is the Old English word <i>gielp</i>, which means “boast.”  Clearly the meaning has changed over time, since yelping is nothing to boast about, as it usually involves pain of some kind.  The word works as a noun and a verb, so you could say “I can hear a dog <i>yelping</i>,” or “The dog’s <i>yelps</i> kept me up all night.”  You could also pet your dog a lot, which will help with the yelps.</p></div>`;
