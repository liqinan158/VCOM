This little organ is very important in helping the body fight infection.</p><p class="long">The <i>spleen</i> is responsible for removing old red blood cells and producing and storing a reserve of blood in case the body needs it. It's a little organ, measuring little more than four inches in length. The term "vent your <i>spleen</i>" is one you might see used.
