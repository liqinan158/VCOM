The epitome. Perfection.</p><p class="long">Hidden in the middle of <i>apotheosis</i> you'll find the Greek <i>theos</i>, meaning god. (<i>Theology</i>, the study of religion, has the same root.) Combine <i>theos</i> with <i>apo</i> "from" and you get a person, place, or thing that is so out-of-this-world amazing that it seems as if it's "from God." It's divine. You could make the assertion that Leonardo da Vinci was the apotheosis of genius and that the Mona Lisa is the apotheosis of all his paintings.</p></div>`;
