It often describes a body in space, such as an artificial <i>satellite</i> that orbits the Earth and beams down signals that power devices like cell phones.</p><p class="long">The word <i>satellite</i> was first used to describe a follower of someone in a superior position. The word's meaning later broadened to describe anything small that's dependent on something larger. The small satellite circles around the more powerful force, like a moon orbiting a planet. <i>Satellite</i> can describe a small country — a satellite country — controlled by a larger one, or a large organization that has a small office — a satellite office — in another location.</p></div>`;
