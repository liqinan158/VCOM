A landlord might <i>profiteer</i> during a housing shortage by doubling rents.</p><p class="long">When you profiteer, you don't just profit â€” you profit more than you should at the expense of someone else. You can also call a person who does this a <i>profiteer</i>. Profiteers famously take advantage of things like scarce food or ongoing conflicts to make a lot of money. The word existed but wasn't commonly used in English until World War I, when journalists started talking about "war <i>profiteers</i>" who benefited financially from shortages and desperation.</p></div>`;
