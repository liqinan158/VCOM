It can be a little spooky to hear a sleepwalker <i>move</i> around a dark house at night.</p><p class="long">You can move from one room to another, or move from Oregon to New Hampshire, changing the place where you live. Dancers move their bodies as they move around on a stage, and chess players move pieces strategically on the board. If someone inspires you to do something, or makes you feel an intense emotion, you can also say that they move you. When your dad says, "Get a <i>move</i> on!" he basically means "Hurry up!"</p></div>`;
