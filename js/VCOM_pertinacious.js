The same holds true if you stubbornly push on a door despite a sign that says “pull.” <i>Pertinacious</i> means unyielding or perversely persistent.</p><p class="long">We get <i>pertinacious</i> from the Latin <i>pertinax</i>, which combines <i>per-</i>, "thoroughly," with <i>tenax</i>, "tenacious." You can impress your friends by dropping <i>pertinacious</i> into conversation when referring to anyone who is bullheaded and obstinately stuck in their ways and opinions. If a Girl Scout is a pertinacious salesperson you might buy fifty boxes of Thin Mints when you only wanted one.</p></div>`;
