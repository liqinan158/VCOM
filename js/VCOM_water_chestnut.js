That crisp, pale, mild-tasting morsel you picked up with your chopsticks is probably a <i>water chestnut</i>.</p><p class="long">There are at least two different plants that are referred to as water chestnuts â€” and confusingly, both are frequently used by Chinese cooks. Neither is actually a nut, but one, also called a "water caltrop," is a seed. The water chestnut that's most familiar to North American fans of Chinese food has the Latin name <i>eleocharis dulcis</i>, and it's the white vegetable that stays crunchy even when cooked or canned.</p></div></div>`;
