It was in use colloquially long before it entered the literary record, and this may be a factor in the word's enduring suppleness. The earliest written examples of <i>clever</i> convey the idea of dexterity — that is, the term was used to describe someone who was good with his hands. Now, <i>clever</i> still means "agile" or "adroit," but it refers to mental, rather than physical, skill. <i>Clever</i> can also be used to describe the products of a nimble mind, such as a "<i>clever</i> scheme" or a "<i>clever</i> device."</p></div>`;
