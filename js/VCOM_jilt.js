It would be cruel to <i>jilt</i> your boyfriend on the day before the prom.</p><p class="long">If a bride jilts her groom, she leaves him waiting for her in his tuxedo, and if a boy jilts his date, he never shows up at the planned time. In either case, it's an unkind and thoughtless thing to do to someone. In the 1660s, to <i>jilt</i> meant "to deceive, cheat, or trick," and it was also a noun meaning "woman who gives hope and then dashes it," from the Middle English root <i>gille</i>, "lass or wench."</p></div>`;
