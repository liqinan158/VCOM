Because Uncle Marvin is so marked by unpredictability, you never bring your friends to family parties, fearing that Uncle Marvin might do something wacky at any moment. Unpredictability can be exciting, but it can also be scary or unpleasant never knowing what someone is going to do next.</p></div>`;
