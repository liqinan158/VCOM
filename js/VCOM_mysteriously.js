Some people say that boats mysteriously disappear in a region of the Atlantic Ocean known as the Bermuda Triangle, and others tell stories of sick people being mysteriously healed by prayer. At the heart of <i>mysteriously</i> is the noun <i>mystery</i>, which had only a religious meaning until the late fourteenth century, and which is rooted in the the Greek word <i>mysterion</i>, "secret rite or doctrine."</p></div>`;
