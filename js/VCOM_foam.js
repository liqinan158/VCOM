Your liquid shampoo becomes a <i>foam</i> as you lather it into your wet hair.</p><p class="long">There's a layer of foam on top of your root beer float, and shaving cream usually comes out of its can in the form of foam. When something froths up this way, you can say that it <i>foams</i>, like turbulent ocean water or a bubble bath that grows as you add water to the tub. The Old English root word is <i>fam</i>, which means "foam," but also "saliva froth" and "sea."</p></div></div>`;
