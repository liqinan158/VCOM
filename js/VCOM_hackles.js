You know, the things that spike up on a scared cat or angry rooster. But in the human world, raising someone's hackles means you've made them boiling mad or super annoyed. For example, spitting spit balls while the teacher isn't looking is sure to raise her hackles. And land you in detention.</p></div></div>`;
