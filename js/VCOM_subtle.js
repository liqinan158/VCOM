The word is pronounced like "suttle" and it was originally spelled that way when it was borrowed from Old French, but the <i>b</i> got imported to make the word look more like its ultimate source, the Latin adjective <i>subtilis</i>. If you try to pronounce the <i>b</i>, your ignorance of how to say the word properly won't be very subtle!</p></div>`;
