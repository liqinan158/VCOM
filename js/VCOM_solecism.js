Forget your mom's birthday? Probably all three, right? Well, don't worry. Instead of just screwing up, what you did was commit a <i>solecism.</i> Sounds kinda neat that way, huh?</p><p class="long">The origin of <i>solecism</i> comes from the ancient Greek word meaning "speaking incorrectly," and <i>solecism</i> does have another meaning that's more specifically verbal. If you say something incorrectly, or make a grammatical error in writing, that's also a solecism. It can be just as mortifying as burping at the dinner table. Well, almost.</p></div></div>`;
