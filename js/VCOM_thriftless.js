If you spend all of your allowance on candy, week after week, you are <i>thriftless</i>.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>thriftless</i> is the opposite of <i>thrifty</i>. When you're thrifty, you possess the quality of <i>thrift</i>, which means being careful about saving money and other resources. When you're thriftless, you lack this habit of thrift; you can see this in the suffix <i>-less</i>, which means "lacking." The good news is that you can cure yourself of being thriftless by getting in the habit of saving at least as much as you spend.</p></div></div>`;
