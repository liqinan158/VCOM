A car battery typically measures between 12 and 14 <i>volts</i>.</p><p class="long">Measuring electricity is complicated, but you can think of volts as the units of pressure a battery or generator exerts on a current of electricity to get it moving so it can produce power (for the electricity in your house, for example). <i>Voltage</i> is the overall term for this force. Both words come from the name of Alessandro Volta,  the scientist who is considered by many to be the inventor of the electric battery.</p></div>`;
