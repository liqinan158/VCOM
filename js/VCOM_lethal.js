The cobra's venom is so <i>lethal</i> that if you get bitten and can't find the antidote, it's lights out forever.</p><p class="long">Poisonous spiders, guns, knives, and radiation â€” all of these things can be <i>lethal</i> because they have the ability to kill. Even some substances that on their own aren't dangerous can become <i>lethal</i> in large quantities. Eating a peanut butter sandwich won't hurt most people, but it can be lethal to those with a nut allergy. Words like <i>deadly</i> and <i>fatal</i> mean the same as <i>lethal</i>.</p></div></div>`;
