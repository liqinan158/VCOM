An <i>enthralling</i> book is hard to put down, even when it's past your bedtime.</p><p class="long">When things captivate or grip you, they're enthralling. You can find another person enthralling, or a well-made movie, a wonderful concert, or an entrancing painting in a museum. <i>Enthralling</i> comes from the verb <i>enthrall</i>, which means "capture one's attention," but had the original meaning of "enslave." The word comes from the prefix <i>en-</i>, "make or put in," and <i>thrall</i>, from the Old English <i>þræl</i>, "serf or slave."</p></div>`;
