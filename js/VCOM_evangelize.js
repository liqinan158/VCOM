Preachers and ministers <i>evangelize</i> from the pulpit in their churches every Sunday.</p><p class="long">Certain Christians believe that it's important to evangelize to others â€” to preach the gospel and convey what they believe. In some cases, Christian missionaries travel to foreign countries to evangelize. The ultimate goal for those who evangelize tends to be converting non-Christians to Christianity. The word <i>evangelize</i> comes from the Church Latin <i>evangelizare</i>, "to spread or preach the Gospel," with the Greek root <i>euangelizesthai</i>, or "bring good news."</p></div>`;
