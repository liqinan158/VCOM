Speeding cars and hyper children have a lot of <i>kinetic energy</i>.</p><p class="long">According to physics, kinetic energy is one of many types of energy that exist. This is energy generated because something is moving â€” the faster it's going, the more kinetic energy it has. A person sitting has no kinetic energy, but a person running like a maniac has tremendous kinetic energy: if they run into you, you'll feel the brunt of it. Footballs, baseballs, rocks, bullets, airplanes, and anything else moving quickly through the air all have kinetic energy.</p></div>`;
