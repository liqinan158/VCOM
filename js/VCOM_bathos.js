If you’re watching a serious drama about Poland’s transition to capitalism and it suddenly ends in a giddy car chase, you might remark on the film’s unexpected <i>bathos</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>bathos</i> came into English in the 17th century from the Greek word <i>bathos</i>, which literally means “depth.” In the 18th century English poet Alexander Pope gave the word its current meaning of a descent from lofty to trite. We often use it for movies or books. Bathos is usually unintentional — which means you can laugh at it. <i>Bathos</i> can also be used more broadly for something that’s trite or overly sentimental.</p></div></div>`;
