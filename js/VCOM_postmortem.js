It's a kind of autopsy done to learn exactly how the person died.</p><p class="long">In Latin, <i>mortem</i> is a form of the word for "death," and <i>post</i> means "after." A <i>postmortem</i>, logically enough, is something that happens after death, usually an examination. Another type of postmortem is a meeting or discussion that follows the completion of a project â€” this kind does not involve an actual death, but simply the end of something, like an art installation or a business venture.</p></div></div>`;
