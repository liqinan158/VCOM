In fact, ancient Anglo-Saxon medical books ascribed some illnesses to <i>elves</i>.</p><p class="long">Old English texts often blamed elves for sharp pains and mental disturbances â€” they were said to cause illness with sharp weapons, such as arrows. The folklore and myths of Scotland, Iceland, and Germany are particularly famous for the inclusion of elves. An elf's tiny size has also led to the use of <i>elfin</i> or <i>elf-like</i> to describe a small person's features: "His little <i>elfin</i> nose was so cute."</p></div></div>`;
