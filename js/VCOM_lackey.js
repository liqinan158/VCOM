For example, a <i>lackey</i> might carry his employer's luggage or fetch her cappuccinos.</p><p class="long">A lackey can also be a servant who wears a uniform, like a butler, doorman, or valet. Only the richest, grandest, snobbiest families employ lackeys these days. Another name for a lackey is a <i>manservant</i>, who works in a private home serving the needs of his employer â€” like a maid, but male. From this earliest meaning came the sense of <i>lackey</i> as a "toady" or "sycophant," someone who fawns and flatters in order to get what they want. The word stems from the Middle French <i>laquais</i>, "foot soldier" or "servant."</p></div>`;
