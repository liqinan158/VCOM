In fact, that last slice of pumpkin pie might even push you into the realm of stuffed.</p><p class="long">The word <i>satiated</i> comes from the Latin <i>satiare</i>, meaning "fill, full, satisfy," which is precisely how a person who is satiated feels — full and satisfied from a good meal. There's nothing better than a hearty home-cooked meal to leave you satiated with a full belly. Other things, besides food, might leave you satiated as well — like a good movie or finishing a challenging task.</p></div></div>`;
