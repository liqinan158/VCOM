This is a specifically Christian concept relating to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. In some sects of the Christian religion, it's believed that the return of Jesus will lead an amazing new era that will last a thousand years. These are millenarian ideas, and they're part of millenarian theology. A novel based on these ideas could be called millenarian fiction.</p></div></div>`;
