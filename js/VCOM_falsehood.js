If your mom has an uncanny knack for knowing when you're telling a <i>falsehood</i>, it means she always knows when you're stretching the truth.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>falsehood</i> is a slightly fancy or old-fashioned way of saying "lie." It's hard to ever completely trust a friend again once he's told you a falsehood, although sometimes people tell small falsehoods simply to make others feel better. Telling your aunt her pink hair looks fine is a small falsehood, while lying about your grades on a college application is a pretty big falsehood. The Latin root is <i>falsus</i>, "deceived or erroneous."</p></div>`;
