Many creoles arise from the contact between both languages and cultures â€” Haitian creole sounds similar to French, but it's also influenced by Portuguese, Spanish, and some West African languages, since it emerged from the connection between French colonists and African slaves. <i>Creole</i> comes from the Portuguese <i>crioulo</i>, "servant raised in one's house."</p></div>`;
