But if you suffered from <i>agoraphobia</i>, it would be terrifying — because you would be afraid of open spaces.</p><p class="long">In a world with so many fears, there’s a phobia for every occasion.  <i>Agoraphobia</i> is the fear of wide open spaces.  The Greek root <i>agora</i> means “public open space” and “marketplace,” so <i>agoraphobia</i> is also the fear of crowds, like the kind you’d find in a busy supermarket.  Like all phobias, agoraphobia can make someone panic and freak out, so if you see a person experiencing agoraphobia, maybe put them inside a closet and see if that helps.</p></div></div>`;
