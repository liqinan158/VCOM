var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">diatribe</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">It's pretty overwhelming when you ask your friend a seemingly innocuous question, like "Do you like hot dogs?" and she unleashes a <i>diatribe</i> about the evils of eating meat. A <i>diatribe</i> is an angry, critical speech.</p><p class="long">This noun has its roots in the Greek <i>diatribē</i>, "pastime or lecture," from <i>diatrībein</i>, "to waste time or wear away," combining <i>dia-</i>, "thoroughly," and <i>trībein</i>, "to rub." So the origin of the word <i>diatribe</i> is connected to both serious study and the spending or wasting of time. With most diatribes, the speaker thinks he's well informed and knows something the listener doesn't, while to most listeners the diatribe is so angry and unhinged that it's just a waste of time.</p></div>`;
