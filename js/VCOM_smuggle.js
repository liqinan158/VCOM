All kinds of things have been <i>smuggled</i> over the years: art, alcohol, drugs, animals, even tea!</p><p class="long">The verb <i>smuggle</i> has expanded to generally mean to bring something in or out in secret, especially if doing so breaks a rule or a law. Kids may smuggle candy into a movie theater so they don't have to pay the high prices at the concession stand. You may smuggle Christmas presents into the house so your kids don't see them. Illegal immigrants may be smuggled into the country for a fee, but if caught they can be deported.</p></div>`;
