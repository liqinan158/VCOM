When you're watching the news on TV, you expect reporters to speak <i>soberly</i>, rather than being silly.</p><p class="long">If you're a serious student, you probably think soberly about each question on a history test, and when your teacher looks soberly at the class before saying, "I need your attention," you know she means business. The adverb <i>soberly</i> comes from <i>sober</i>, which has the primary meaning of "not under the influence of drugs or alcohol," but also means "grave or serious." The Latin root, <i>sobrius</i> also has two meanings: "not drunk," and "sensible."</p></div>`;
