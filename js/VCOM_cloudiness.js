Your favorite days at the beach might be when <i>cloudiness</i> keeps everyone else away!</p><p class="long">You can use this noun for the state of being overcast or foggy, like the cloudiness at the top of a mountain or the cloudiness that makes it impossible to watch a meteor shower. It's also good for something that's unclear or vague, whether it's water or ideas. So the cloudiness of a pond might keep you from diving in, and the cloudiness of a philosopher's writing may leave you more confused than before you opened the book.</p></div></div>`;
