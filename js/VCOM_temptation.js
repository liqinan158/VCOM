That bag of peanut butter cups on top of your fridge might be an example of a <i>temptation</i>.</p><p class="long">The thing that you want despite knowing it's not good for you — like the cool sneakers you really can't afford — is a temptation. The feeling is also a temptation — so wanting those shoes is <i>temptation</i>. The Latin word <i>temptare</i>, or to taste, is where <i>temptation</i> comes from, which makes a lot of sense when you think of that bag of peanut butter cups calling to you from the kitchen.</p></div></div>`;
