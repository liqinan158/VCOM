The types of <i>love</i> listed here mean different things — but what remains is the certainty, at least for now, that what you <i>love</i> is what you adore.</p><p class="long">Love is an expression of emotion. Love, it is said, can make you walk miles barefoot in the rain just to see the person you can't stop thinking about. Or, it can make you cross the street because the store "you <i>love</i>" is located there. <i>Love</i> is a versatile word — like what it describes. Love takes many forms, but the word typically describes an affection that is deep and emotional. If you say you’re “in <i>love</i>,” that tends to refer to the romantic kind of love.</p></div></div>`;
