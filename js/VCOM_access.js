If chemicals are being stolen from a lab, you might ask who has <i>access</i> to the lab. <i>Access</i> is approaching or making use of something, or the ability to do so</p><p class="long">Sometimes the word is applied to a person. If you work in the same room as your boss, you might have easy <i>access</i> to her. A really good boss will work hard to make herself <i>accessible</i> to her employees.  <i>Access</i> is from Middle English, from Middle French <i>acces</i> "arrival," from Latin <i>accessus</i> "an approach," from <i>accedere</i> "to approach."</p></div></div>`;
