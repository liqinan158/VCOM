Many letters to the editors of newspapers and comments on websites are jeremiads, and someone addressing a city council or school board might make a verbal jeremiad — speaking for a long time about their many grievances. The word <i>jeremiad</i> was coined in 1700s France, as <i>jérémiade</i>, and it was a reference to the Old Testament's "Lamentations of Jeremiah."</p></div>`;
