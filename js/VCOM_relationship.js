If you're related to somebody — your parents, your aunts and uncles, your cousins — you share a family <i>relationship</i> with them.</p><p class="long">You can also use <i>relationship</i> to describe dealings between various groups, as “Members of the European Union have a <i>relationship</i> of economic interconnectedness,” or “A lease helps define your <i>relationship</i> with your landlord.” You'll also see <i>relationship</i> used with interactions that don't directly involve people. In many of these cases, the word <i>relation</i> is better. For example, in the sentence "We are always looking at the <i>relationship</i> between ticket price and sales," it would be better to use <i>relation</i>.</p></div></div>`;
