There is often a <i>haze</i> hovering over the city of Los Angeles.</p><p class="long">Although the noun <i>haze</i> can describe any kind of misty or slightly obscured air, it usually refers to visible air pollution, rather than just fog. You can also talk about being in a haze when you're confused or disoriented. When you hear <i>haze</i> being used as a verb, it usually means to torment a new, young recruit to a club, group, team, the way fraternity brothers sometimes haze a new member, forcing him to perform humiliating or dangerous actions.</p></div>`;
