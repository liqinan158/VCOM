A <i>hexagon</i> is a polygon that has six sides. Remember the "x" in "six" and "hex," and you'll be fine.</p><p class="long">Many of our words in science and math hearken back to the Greek, and <i>hexagon</i> is no exception. The idea of a six-sided figure comes from the Greek <i>hexágōnon</i>, with <i>gonia</i> meaning "angle," which makes sense, as a <i>hexagon</i> not only has six sides, but six angles, or vertices. There are various types of hexagons, including the "regular <i>hexagon</i>" (where all the sides and angles are equal to each other) and the "irregular <i>hexagon</i>" (which has unequal angles and sides).</p></div>`;
