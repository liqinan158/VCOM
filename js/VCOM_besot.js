If television tends to <i>besot</i> you, it would be smart not to watch a lot of TV right before a big test at school.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>besot</i> is much less common than the related adjective <i>besotted</i>, which means so infatuated with someone that it leaves you dizzy and a little bit silly. Both words have their roots in the Old English <i>sott</i>, "stupid person or fool."
