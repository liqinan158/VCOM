If your older brother has trouble getting up in the morning, you can help him out by practicing your <i>trumpet</i> outside his bedroom door at six a.m.</p><p class="long">Trumpets fall under the category of brass instruments, along with tubas and saxophones. When you play a trumpet, you need to use something called <i>embouchure</i>, the proper shaping of your mouth and lips so your breath buzzes against the mouthpiece in just the right way.  Louis Armstrong and Miles Davis were famous jazz <i>trumpet</i> players. As a verb, to <i>trumpet</i> is to announce something very loudly, as if you were playing it on a trumpet.</p></div>`;
