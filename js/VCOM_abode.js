A British solicitor (lawyer) would also use the word <i>abode</i> to describe his office, and if he worked from his home the word would cover both his work and his residence. Interestingly, if you were to substitute the <i>o</i> in the middle of the word for a <i>c</i>, you'd have the first five letters of the alphabet â€” <i>abcde</i>.</p></div>`;
