It's surprising how much a paper <i>cut</i> can hurt.</p><p class="long">When you cut something, you slice into it or remove a part of it, like when you cut your friend's hair or cut a pan of brownies into squares. You can also cut figuratively, like when you're cut by your piano teacher's sharp words or when a freak snowstorm forces you to cut your game short. An unexcused absence is also called a cut. And the phrase "make the cut" means you are chosen for a group or team, while others are not.</p></div></div>`;
