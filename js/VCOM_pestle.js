If you're grinding spices, you put them in a container called a mortar and use the <i>pestle</i> to smash them up until they're finely ground.</p><p class="long">The mortar and pestle was originally used by pharmacists to grind substances for medical use. Because they are sold together as sets and are always used together, many people aren't sure which is the mortar and which is the pestle. The origin of <i>pestle</i> is the Latin word <i>pistillum</i>, which means "pounder." This can help you remember that the pestle is the pounder. Also, <i>pistillum</i> looks like <i>pistol</i>, which is also held in the hand.</p></div></div>`;
