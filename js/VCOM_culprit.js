When your wallet got stolen out of your pocket, there was a <i>culprit</i> to blame in the crowd.</p><p class="long">The word <i>culprit</i> comes from the Anglo French words <i>cul prit,</i> a contraction of <i>culpable,</i> which means "deserving blame." A culprit isn't always a person; it can be anything that caused something bad to happen â€” even a sock left on the steps can be a culprit if it makes you slip and fall. Don't confuse <i>culprit</i> with <i>scapegoat</i>, which is a person or thing that gets blamed for something it didn't do.</p></div>`;
