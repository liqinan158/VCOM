People often say that it is your <i>civic</i> duty to vote.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>civic</i> comes from the Latin word <i>civis</i>, which was the word for a citizen of Ancient Rome. It is also a root word for "city," so <i>civic</i> can also mean anything related to a city. In your town, civic leaders meet frequently and public input is always welcome. So if you have a grievance about a civic issue, you should attend a meeting â€” or drop by the diner where the mayor always eats breakfast.</p></div></div>`;
