If you take up sailing, you might use a <i>winch</i> to adjust the position of the sails. Ahoy, matey!</p><p class="long">You use a winch for things like pulling out cars stuck in the mud or snow. Tow trucks have winches, and so do sailboats, for tightening (or "trimming") a sail line. As a verb, <i>winch</i> means to use one: "I told you not to drive through that mud. Now we'll have to <i>winch</i> you out of there." The root of <i>winch</i> means "to bend," possibly in reference to the shape of a winch's handle.</p></div>`;
