This short, quick, pleasurable trip could be called a <i>jaunt</i> (unless of course, you get your pizza from Italy, that’s called “time to get a closer pizza place”).</p><p class="long"><i>Jaunt</i> was used in the 17th century to describe a journey on a horse just long enough to tire the horse out. Nebraska has what they call a Junk Jaunt, which is a yard sale that includes up to 40 towns and stretches nearly 300 miles and draws up to 20,000 people. That’s more than enough to make any horse tired, but they call it a <i>jaunt</i> nevertheless.</p></div>`;
