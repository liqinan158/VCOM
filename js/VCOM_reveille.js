It's meant to wake everyone up in a patriotic way.</p><p class="long">This word is a modification of French imperative <i>r√©veillez</i>, which means wake up, or "Awaken!" Appropriately, the noun <i>reveille</i> refers to a bugle call meant to accomplish exactly this. Reveille most often occurs at sunrise in a military encampment or base when a bugler plays a familiar tune to wake up the military personnel.</p></div>`;
