It's hard to get out of bed in the morning when your cat lies down on your chest and <i>nuzzles</i> you.</p><p class="long">A mother might nuzzle her new baby's head, and a horse will nuzzle a person's hand â€” hoping for an apple or sugar cube. In the fifteenth century, this word instead meant "to bring the nose to the ground," from the verb <i>nose</i>, "pry or smell with the nose." The current meaning was influenced by words like <i>nestle</i> and the now-obsolete "nursle," meaning "to nurse."</p></div>`;
