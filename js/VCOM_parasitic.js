You can also use the word <i>parasitic</i> more metaphorically, to describe a person who takes without giving anything in return. A thirty year-old man who lives with his mother, eating her food and not paying rent, could be described as <i>parasitic</i>, since he survives by sponging off another person. <i>Parasitic</i> comes from the Greek word <i>parasitos</i>, "eating at another's table."</p></div></div>`;
