If you can barely <i>manage</i> to keep your goldfish alive, you should probably think twice about adopting those Golden Retriever puppies.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>manage</i> also means to supervise or oversee either things or people at work. You might manage six people at the donut shop, even though you've only worked there for four months. If you carefully manage your donut shop earnings, you should be able to buy that new car next year. <i>Manage</i> also means to cope with or come to terms with. It might seem scary to go to college in another state, but I know you'll manage.</p></div></div>`;
