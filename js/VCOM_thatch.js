People have used <i>thatch</i> to keep the rain out for at least 300 years.</p><p class="long">Although dry grasses might not seem like the sturdiest roof, thatch is actually a rain-proof, insulating substance. These days it's most common to find thatched roofs in developing countries, but some people use it for a deliberately rustic look. If someone describes your hair as <i>thatch</i>, they mean it looks as dry, messy, and thick as the thatch used as a roofing material. The root of <i>thatch</i> means "to cover."</p></div></div>`;
