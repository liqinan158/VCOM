Unless of course you are a <i>juvenile</i>.  In which case, carry on.</p><p class="long">While the noun <i>juvenile</i> refers to someone not physically or emotionally mature, the word is often used as an adjective to refer to anything specifically for young people, such as <i>juvenile</i> reading materials or movies.  It can be derisive, as in "Don't act so <i>juvenile</i>," suggesting a silliness unbecoming an adult.  The word comes from the Latin <i>juvenīlis</i>, meaning "youthful" — similar, but much more flattering.</p></div></div>`;
