It'll make you pump your fist and yell "Hurrah!"</p><p class="long"><i>Triumph</i> can be a noun or a verb, so you can have a triumph after the big game when you triumph over your opponents. Either way, it's a way to rejoice and a reason to whoop it up. The word comes from the Latin <i>triumphus</i> which is an "achievement, success, procession for a victorious general or admiral."  The jury's still out on whether it comes from the Greek <i>thriambos</i>, as a "hymn to Dionysus," but it's fun to imagine that a <i>triumph</i> is a song to the Greek god of party animals. Fittingly, a <i>Triumph</i> is also the name of a motorcycle, a cool car, and a hard rockin' band from Canada.</p></div></div>`;
