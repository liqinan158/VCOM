Or provoking popular thought by attacking traditions and institutions? Then you're definitely an <i>iconoclast</i>.</p><p class="long">To be called an iconoclast today is usually kind of cool â€” they're rugged individualists, bold thinkers who don't give a hoot what tradition calls for. But back in medieval Greece, the iconoclasts had a more thuggish reputation. Stemming from the Greek words <i>eikon</i>, meaning  "image," and <i>klastes</i>, meaning "breaker," an iconoclast was someone who destroyed religious sculptures and paintings.</p></div>`;
