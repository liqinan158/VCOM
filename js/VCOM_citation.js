A <i>citation</i> can be an official award, but it can also mean something less thrilling, like a summons to appear in court.</p><p class="long">If you climb a tree and rescue a frightened cat, the mayor might present you with a citation for bravery. If you're hurrying to the ceremony and your mom speeds and gets a traffic citation, her insurance company might raise her premiums. <i>Citation</i> comes from the Latin <i>citationem</i>, which means “to call forward.” You can think of the mayor calling you forward to receive your plaque, or the judge calling your mom forward to receive her fine.  A citation can also be a quote, like a passage in a newspaper article describing your cat-saving feat as "an act of heroism."</p></div>`;
