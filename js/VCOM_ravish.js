The older meaning of <i>ravish</i> is to overcome by physical assault (especially sexual assault) and is still sometimes used.</p><p class="long"><i>Ravish</i> is a verb of contrasts, having two meanings that, while both dealing with emotional issues, are polar opposites — the first being to fill with joy, the second being to assault and violate a woman against her will. The history of <i>ravish</i> began with the negative connotation — that of seizing by violence and carrying someone, usually a woman, away. It comes from the Latin <i>rapere</i>, although the meaning wasn't always sexual violation — the idea of rape didn't appear until the mid-15th century.</p></div>`;
