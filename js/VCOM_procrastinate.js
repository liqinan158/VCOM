When people sit down to write term papers, they can find all kinds of clever ways to procrastinate: reorganizing the paperclips, calling everyone they know, typing "I am bored" fifty times in a row.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>procrastinate</i> is from Latin <i>prōcrāstināre</i>, from <i>prō-</i> "forward" plus <i>crāstinus</i> "of tomorrow," from <i>crās</i> "tomorrow." Some synonyms are <i>defer</i>, <i>postpone</i>, and <i>delay</i>, though these words often apply to more positive reasons for inaction. The reason for procrastination is often assumed to be laziness, or just that the task or action is unpleasant and difficult to begin.</p></div>`;
