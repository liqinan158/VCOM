If you find living in a small town <i>confining</i>, you probably feel claustrophobic, like there's not enough room there for you and your aspirations.</p><p class="long">The <i>-fin-</i> in <i>confining</i> is the same root that's found in words such as the French word <i>fin</i>, meaning "end" or "limit." The <i>con-</i> is the familiar Latin suffix that means "together." So when something is <i>confining</i>, it's like a border drawn around you. In some cases, <i>confining</i> can be a good thing, like when your efforts at <i>confining</i> the fire to the kitchen saved the rest of the house.</p></div></div>`;
