Often the works of art are so <i>minute</i> that you can only see them with a magnifying glass.</p><p class="long"><i>Minutus</i> is the Latin word for "small," and it gave rise to both the adjective <i>minute</i> (my-NOOT), or incredibly small, and the noun <i>minute</i> (MIN-it), or 60 seconds of time. Though they are pronounced differently, both words refer to small measurements. An object can be minute, like a flea compared with its dog, and less concrete things can be minute, like your minute chance of winning the lottery. A minute freckle on the side of your nose is a minute detail of your whole face.</p></div>`;
