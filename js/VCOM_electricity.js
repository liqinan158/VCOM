Don't try that on your own.</p><p class="long">The word <i>electricity</i> comes from the Greek <i>electron</i>, which doesn’t mean what you might expect. It means "amber," that yellow or reddish brown stone used for jewelry. The ancients noticed that when you rub amber, it gets an electrostatic charge and will pick up light things like feathers and straw. You can also describe other kinds of energy as electricity — when you're really crazy about someone, you can say there's electricity between the two of you.</p></div>`;
