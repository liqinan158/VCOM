A transnational human rights law could affect every developed country in the world, for instance. Another way to say <i>transnational</i> is <i>international</i> or <i>multinational</i>. The definition of the Latin prefix <i>trans</i>, however, gives a clear clue to the word's meaning: "across, beyond, or to go beyond."</p></div>`;
