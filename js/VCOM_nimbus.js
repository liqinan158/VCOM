A shadowy figure standing in front of your car's headlights might have a <i>nimbus</i> around it.</p><p class="long">One kind of nimbus is the holy glow that's said to surround the body or head of a saint â€” a halo, in other words. Many religious works of art feature Christian saints, each with a radiant nimbus. There is a more scientific kind of nimbus as well, a large, gray rain cloud. In Latin, <i>nimbus</i> simply means "cloud," possibly connected to <i>nebula</i>, "mist, vapor, or fog."</p></div></div>`;
