If you’ve just heard a <i>synergistic</i> symphony, the musicians must have played very well together.</p><p class="long">You’ve probably heard the phrase “more than the sum of its parts.” The prefix <i>syn-</i> means "together with" or "united." When synergistic parts work together, they accomplish more than they could alone. <i>Synergetic</i> is often used to describe the effect of drugs working together — where one drug increases the other’s effectiveness. <i>Synergistic</i> can also describe the cooperative efforts of several people working together — like a team of superheroes fighting crime.</p></div></div>`;
