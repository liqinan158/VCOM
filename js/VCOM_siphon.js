If you're giving your goldfish a magnificent new bowl, you can use a <i>siphon</i> to move the water from the old one to the new.</p><p class="long">A siphon is a tube running from one container to another that uses gravity to cause liquid to flow. The key is that the container with the liquid has to be at a higher level than the container youâ€™re moving the liquid to. You have to use force to start the initial flow, but after that gravity takes over. We also use <i>siphon</i> as a verb, for the process of emptying. An endless meeting might siphon off all your energy.</p></div>`;
