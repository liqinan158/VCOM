var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">bachelor</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">There are two criteria needed in order to be a <i>bachelor</i>: one is that you can’t be married, and the other is that you have to be a man.  Any people outside of these criteria are some other word.</p><p class="long">The origins of <i>bachelor</i> are unclear, but some similar Latin words are <i>baccalāris</i> (“farm hand”), <i>baccalārium</i> (“dairy farm”), and <i>bacca</i> (“cow”).  Maybe some <i>bachelors</i> spent a lot of time milking cows before getting married in the olden days.  The phrase “eligible bachelor” means a guy who would make a great husband, and the phrase “confirmed bachelor” describes a man who is having so much fun being single that he’ll probably never marry.  Either way, pronounce it like this: BATCH-uh-lur.</p></div></div>`;
