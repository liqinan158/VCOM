Some offices have a <i>desk</i> for each employee.</p><p class="long">Students often sit at classroom desks arranged in rows, and you'll also find desks in libraries, offices, and homes. Your college roommate might prefer to study while lying in bed, while you like working at your desk. Someone who has a "<i>desk</i> job" works in an office. <i>Desk</i> comes from the Medieval Latin <i>desca</i>, "table to write on," which has a Greek root, <i>diskos</i>, "platter or disk."</p></div></div>`;
