When you hand the cashier your <i>coupon</i>, he will subtract some amount from your total bill.</p><p class="long">You can cut coupons out of a newspaper, get them in the mail, or find them online. A restaurant coupon might offer a free beverage when you buy dinner, and a grocery store coupon could give you a five dollar savings on your dog's favorite kind of kibble. The original coupons were used by Coca Cola in the late 1800s â€” they were vouchers for a free Coke, and they're credited with spreading the soft drink's popularity across the United States.</p></div>`;
