If you've ever brainstormed, you know what this is like â€” you <i>bandy</i> about different ideas until you find one that works.</p><p class="long"><i>Bandy</i> also means to exchange blows, like in a professional fight. As a skilled heavyweight boxer, you are known to bandy with your opponent for several minutes before you knock him out. <i>Bandy</i> comes from the Middle French word <i>bander</i> which means "to strike back and forth."
