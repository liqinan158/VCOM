When your <i>colt</i> is older than four, you can call him a stallion, gelding, or simply a horse.</p><p class="long">There are many terms for horses, depending what age they are and whether they're male or female. While <i>colt</i> can only refer to a young male, and a female of a similar age would be called a <i>filly</i>, you can talk about a horse of either sex that's between one and two years old as a <i>yearling</i>. The word <i>colt</i> comes directly from Old English, and it originally meant "young ass," or "young camel."</p></div></div>`;
