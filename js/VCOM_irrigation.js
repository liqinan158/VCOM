If you want to start a strawberry farm in the desert, <i>irrigation</i> will be necessary.</p><p class="long"><i>Irrigation</i> comes from the Latin for "moist" or "wet," but it means the purposeful wetting of something. We wouldnâ€™t really say that a storm provides irrigation (unless we were poetically trying to personify the storm). Irrigation systems are often complex combinations of canals, channels, and hoses. The word <i>irrigation</i> is also used in medicine to describe the process of washing out a wound before dressing it.</p></div></div>`;
