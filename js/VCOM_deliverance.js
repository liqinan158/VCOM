One meaning of <i>deliver</i> is “to set free” — and that’s what deliverance is: the act of setting someone free. <i>Deliverance</i> often has religious connotations, but the word can be used for other kinds of rescue or liberation. You might want deliverance from the hardship of working on your uncle’s farm all summer, or at least deliverance from the smell of manure.</p></div></div>`;
