This type of woodwork includes many small, intricate pieces laid out in a geometrical pattern, almost like a mosaic.</p><p class="long"><i>Parquet</i> is a French word that rhymes with <i>tray</i>. In fact, this type of woodwork originated in France and seems to have first been used on the floors at the Palace of Versailles. It is decorative in nature and can be used for flooring and also for furniture, such as tabletops. Sometimes <i>parquet</i> is also used to describe the main seating area in a theater â€” closest to the orchestra, or stage.</p></div></div>`;
