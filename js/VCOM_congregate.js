At school dances, you may <i>congregate</i> with your friends, because you get nervous in front of kids you don't know very well.</p><p class="long"><i>Congregate</i> comes from Latin root words <i>com</i>, meaning "together" and <i>gregare</i>, meaning "to gather in a flock." <i>Congregation</i>, or a gathering or assembly, comes from the same roots, as does <i>gregarious</i>, an adjective describing someone who likes to gather with others to socialize. If you remember the key word is <i>flock</i> — what ministers often call their congregations — you should have no trouble remembering <i>congregate</i> means to flock together.</p></div></div>`;
