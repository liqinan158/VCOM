It describes a "doctor" who would "mount a bench" in the marketplace. Standing a bit higher than the crowd enabled people to hear his sales pitch and see the potions and powders he claimed were medical cures that never failed â€” claims as bogus as his credentials. A mountebank is a fast-talking crook pretending to be an expert.</p></div></div>`;
