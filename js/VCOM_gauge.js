To <i>gauge</i> is to measure or test.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>gauge</i> means to estimate or measure, while the noun <i>gauge</i> is a tool you can use to make such a measurement. If you've ever seen someone check the air pressure in a tire, the instrument she used was called a tire gauge. The thickness, or diameter, of an item like wire (or the barrel of a gun) is another meaning of <i>gauge</i>.</p></div></div>`;
