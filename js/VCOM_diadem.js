If you’ve just won the Miss America pageant, reach up your hand — that’s right — that rhinestone encrusted circlet on your head? That’s a <i>diadem</i>.</p><p class="long">While <i>diadem</i> is a straightforward word meaning "crown," it can also refer to the jewels or other ornaments on a crown. It also sounds like diamond, which is handy for remembering the meaning, because a crown might well have diamonds on it. Or, the diadem could be the diamond on the crown. Technically, you could have a diadem on a diadem, but it would be confusing to say it that way. It comes from the Greek <i>diadema</i>, which was cloth tied around the head to signify royalty. Not as nice as diamonds though, really!</p></div></div>`;
