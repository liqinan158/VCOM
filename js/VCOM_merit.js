If you receive a certificate of <i>merit</i> in school, you are being recognized for doing a good job. As a verb, <i>merit</i> means "deserve." Your certificate might <i>merit</i> a prominent place on your bulletin board!</p><p class="long">You will often hear the phrases <i>merit</i>-based promotion and <i>merit</i>-based pay, which come up when employees are pushing against a system in which time on the job––and not job performance––determines when workers are promoted and how much they are paid. Using the word <i>merit</i> suggests impartiality and objectivity––such as when you swear off a prejudiced approach to something and vow to "judge it on its <i>merits</i>."</p></div></div>`;
