You can refer to your spouse's entire family as your <i>in-laws</i>.</p><p class="long">In some countries, a married woman moves in with her in-laws, symbolically becoming part of their family. In the U.S. some families live with extended family members — a man may live with his wife, kids, and his mother- and father-in-law — but more often each individual nuclear family lives separately. <i>In-law</i> originally meant "anyone of a relationship not natural" or "not by blood."</p></div></div>`;
