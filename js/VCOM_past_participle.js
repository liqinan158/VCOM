For example, in the sentence "Have you sung karaoke?" the word <i>sung</i> is a <i>past participle</i>.</p><p class="long">While past participles come from verbs, and often act as verbs, they can also be used as adjectives. If you say, "The instructions were shouted across the classroom," the word <i>shouted</i> is the past participle. You can also say, "The teacher's shouted instructions echoed through the classroom." And to use that same past participle in a past perfect tense, you could say, "That teacher had shouted for the last time that day; after that, he came down with laryngitis."</p></div></div>`;
