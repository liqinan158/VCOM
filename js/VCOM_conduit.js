Thanks to it, you don't have to go fetch water from the well whenever your mom wants a cup of coffee.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>conduit</i> comes from root words meaning "pipe," and the word retains this definition. For example, a channel between a reservoir and a water treatment plant could be called a conduit. <i>Conduit</i> can also be used in a figurative sense to refer to someone or something that conveys goods, information, or ideas. For instance, a religious leader might be seen as a conduit who brings divine messages to the people.</p></div>`;
