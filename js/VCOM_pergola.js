For example, you might have an ivy-covered  <i>pergola</i> in your yard.</p><p class="long">Other words for <i>pergola</i> are <i>trellis</i> or <i>arbor</i>. When gardeners plant climbing roses or ivy or other plants that like to wind upward around supports as they grow, they often use a pergola. The frame holds the vines and also provides a decorative arch that looks pretty in a garden or yard. The word <i>pergola</i> is Italian, from the Latin <i>pergula</i>, "projecting roof," which is most likely rooted in <i>pergere</i>, "to come forward."</p></div></div>`;
