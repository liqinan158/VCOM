You can always tell when you are close to the ocean, because you can smell the <i>brine</i> and hear the sea gulls.</p><p class="long"><i>Brine</i> is also a salty solution used to pickle or preserve foods. If you want to make pickles, you have to soak cucumbers in brine for several days or even weeks before canning them. As a verb, <i>brine</i> means to soak in a salty solution. If you live in the southern United States, you might brine watermelon rind and okra, which may sound strange to someone from Michigan's Upper Peninsula who's more familiar with brining eggs.</p></div></div>`;
