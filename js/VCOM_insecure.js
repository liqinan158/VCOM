An <i>insecure</i> person might constantly doubt their own intelligence. An <i>insecure</i> building is an easy target for even the most bumbling burglar.</p><p class="long">Break <i>insecure</i> down to its basic parts and you've got <i>in</i>, meaning "not," combined with <i>secure</i>, meaning "safe": not safe. This understanding of the word emerged in the 1640â€™s. It wasn't until 1917 that people began to use <i>insecure</i> to describe delicate, unsure egos. Today it's used to describe everything from easily cracked safes to uncertain futures.</p></div></div>`;
