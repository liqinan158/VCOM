Energetic, long-legged puppies tend to <i>lollop</i> around, stumbling and leaping as they go.</p><p class="long">When people lollop, they do a kind of goofy gallop — a little kid is much more likely to lollop than her dignified grandfather is. Young animals also tend to lollop, like a clumsy young colt or a bouncy, capering kitten. The verb <i>lollop</i> probably comes from <i>loll</i>, "to lounge idly," which is thought to be imitative in origin — in other words, the word itself sounds like rocking or swinging.</p></div></div>`;
