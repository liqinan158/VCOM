Blood and lymph cells are both considered to be corpuscles because they are suspended in liquid within the body. Sometimes the word is used to mean simply "a small piece of something," which is how <i>corpuscle</i> was originally used, rooted in the Latin <i>corpusculum</i>, "a puny body, an atom, or a particle."</p></div>`;
