When an art historian or English teacher uses it, the word <i>masterpiece</i> implies a truly sublime, amazing creation. You can also describe something that's simply great as a masterpiece, like the seven-layer chocolate cake your mom baked for your birthday. <i>Masterpiece</i> comes from the Dutch <i>meesterstuk</i>, "work by which a craftsman attains the rank of master."</p></div></div>`;
