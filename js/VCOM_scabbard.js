Some cooks wear their French knives in a <i>scabbard</i> so they'll be ready to chop no matter where they are in the kitchen.</p><p class="long">Youâ€™ve probably seen a <i>scabbard</i> in an older movie. The hero sheaths his sword in a long wooden, metal or leather scabbard hanging from his belt. The origins of the word, however, are not that manly. <i>Scabbard</i> comes from an old Germanic compound meaning "blade protector."</p></div></div>`;
