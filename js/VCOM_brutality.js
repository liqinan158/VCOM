Avoid being the giver or receiver of <i>brutality</i> if you wish to remain a happy human.</p><p class="long"><i>Brutality</i> comes from <i>brutal</i> (savage, fierce), plus <i>-ity</i> which makes it a noun. It’s the state of being a brute. Many criminals — especially murderers, rapists, and abusers — are guilty of brutality. Police brutality is what happens when the cops use extreme unnecessary force. <i>Brutality</i> is a strong word — just slapping someone isn't quite brutality. Brutality is more like beating a person with a tire iron. <i>Brutality</i> is also the name of a death metal band from Florida.</p></div></div>`;
