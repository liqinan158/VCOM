Watching your favorite movie for the seventh or eighth time will either <i>reconfirm</i> your admiration for it or start to bore you a little.</p><p class="long">When an experience reconfirms an idea you've already held for a while, it provides extra evidence and support for that view. For example, your grandfather might say, "I was already convinced that kids today are much more rude than they used to be, but watching that boy text at the dinner table just <i>reconfirms</i> it." <i>Reconfirm</i> adds the "again" prefix <i>re-</i> to <i>confirm</i>, from the Latin <i>confirmare</i>, "make firm" or "strengthen."</p></div></div>`;
