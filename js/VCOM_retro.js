A <i>retro</i> diner might serve 1950s-style milkshakes and be decorated like a diner from that era, but the prices will be much more modern.</p><p class="long">If you like retro clothes, you probably shop online and at thrift shops, where you can find pants from the 70s and prom dresses from the 50s. Retro music is heavily influenced by past genres, like rockabilly or doo-wop. You can also use <i>retro</i> as a noun: "I'm really into <i>retro</i> when it comes to cars." The word was first used in the 1970s in French, <i>rétro</i>, short for <i>rétrograde</i>, from the Latin <i>retrogradi</i>, "move backward."</p></div></div>`;
