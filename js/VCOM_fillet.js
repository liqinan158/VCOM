If you order a <i>fillet</i> of salmon at a restaurant, it won't have any bones in it.</p><p class="long">You can eat a fish fillet or a fillet of beef â€” either one will be boneless. If you cut a fillet yourself, you <i>fillet</i> the meat. The oldest meaning of the noun <i>fillet</i>, one that's rare today, is "a ribbon worn around the head." It comes from the French <i>filet</i>, the diminutive form of <i>fil</i>, or "thread." The meat meaning came from the technique of tying it with a string before it was cut.</p></div>`;
