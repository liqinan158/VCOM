The more <i>pixels</i> there are, the more the image looks real or accurate.</p><p class="long">Any digital image is made up of pixels, and when someone talks about the resolution of a computer monitor or TV screen, they're referring to the number of pixels. Older televisions have around 300,000 pixels, but new high-definition TVs can have more than two million pixels, which produces a very sharp, clear image. The word <i>pixel</i> came from <i>pictures</i>, or <i>pics</i>, and <i>element</i>, and was coined in 1969.</p></div></div>`;
