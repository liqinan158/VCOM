When you plan a trip to the amusement park and it turns out that the sun is shining, that’s felicitous. If you need to mail a package by a certain date and you make it to the post office just in time, that’s also felicitous. The Latin root of <i>felicitous</i> is <i>felix</i>, "happy or lucky."</p></div>`;
