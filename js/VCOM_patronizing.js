For the record, your snobby attitude is not impressing anyone.</p><p class="long">A "patron" is someone who subsidizes or finances another person or organization â€” usually an artist or charitable institution. So the word <i>patronizing</i> stems from this idea of someone bestowing money or help on another.  Today, the sense of condescension is strongly attached to the adjective, while the word "patron" is still a positive description of someone who gives.</p></div></div>`;
