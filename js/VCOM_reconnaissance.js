Often it’s used as a military term, but you could also do <i>reconnaissance</i> on a new employee before you hire her, or a resort before you take a vacation.</p><p class="long"><i>Reconnaissance</i> is a noun, and it technically means “the act of reconnoitering.” Whoa. Never heard that word before? <i>Reconnoitering</i> is just a fancy way of saying that you’re checking something out — sometimes in a sneaky way. If you like a girl in your Spanish class, you might ask a friend to do some reconnaissance to find out what she’s like. The word comes from the French <i>reconnaître</i>, which means “recognize.”</p></div>`;
