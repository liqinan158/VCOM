If your brother's face started to <i>swell</i> after he ate lobster for the first time, you'd probably guess that he's allergic to shellfish.</p><p class="long">You can use the word <i>swell</i> to describe what happens to an injured body part, like a black eye that swells up, or in a figurative way, to describe a feeling of fullness, like when your heart swells with pride at your sister's big music performance. In the 1930s, <i>swell</i> became a popular slang term meaning <i>great</i> or <i>excellent</i>. But it also can describe a wealthy, elegant person, like a group of swells at a fancy restaurant.</p></div>`;
