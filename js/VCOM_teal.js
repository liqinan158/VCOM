The color gets its name from a kind of duck, also called a <i>teal</i>.</p><p class="long">The common teal is a migratory water bird, a duck with a teal stripe on its head and wings. The origin of the word is unclear, but we know the bird came first and then the colorâ€”the green-blue <i>teal</i> was first used in print in a 1923 clothing advertisement. It was added as an official color to the Plochere Color System, an interior design reference, in 1948, and became a Crayola crayon color in 1990.</p></div></div>`;
