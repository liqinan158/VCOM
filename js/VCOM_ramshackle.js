Is it half tumbling down? Congratulations! It's <i>ramshackle</i> â€” in other words, in terrible condition and barely holding together.</p><p class="long">If you think there's a similarity between a place that's been ransacked and a place that's ramshackle, you'd be right. <i>Ramshackle</i> comes from <i>ransackle,</i> an old 19th century term for "ransack." Although <i>ramshackle</i> is usually intended as a negative term, that's not always the case. Sometimes it can imply a certain cute picturesque quality. Buildings, places, and even some objects such as cars can be considered ramshackle.</p></div>`;
