She’s a budding <i>paleontology</i> expert.</p><p class="long">Scientific language aims at clarity, and scientists generally speak to each other in Greek and Latin. The commonly used suffix <i>-ology</i> comes from Greek, and it means "the study of." The prefix <i>paleo</i> means "old." So, paleontology is the study of that which is old — really, really old. The word <i>paleontology</i> entered the English language in the 19th century, just as scientists were making a systematic effort to analyze fossil records.</p></div></div>`;
