That means you force the desire to be more subtle so you can continue listening — even if you don't want to.</p><p class="long">Psychologists use the verb <i>sublimate</i> to describe the process of channeling intense energy into something useful or appropriate. Freud sublimated his desire to live at home with his mother, and he moved into his own apartment. <i>Sublimate</i> is related to the word <i>sublime</i> — both words come from the Latin word <i>sublimare</i>, which means "to raise up" or "to exalt." So Freud's finally getting his own place is, arguably, a superior — a more exalted — living situation.</p></div>`;
