You're also topsy-turvy when your life is figuratively turned upside down, like when you move across the country or adopt triplets. This word dates back at least as far as the 16th century, and there are many theories about its origin. The most likely root is the now-obsolete <i>terve</i>, "to overturn," from the Old English <i>tearflian</i>, "to roll over and over."</p></div>`;
