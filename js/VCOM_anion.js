That's an atom that either has extra electrons, giving it a negative charge, or is missing electrons, resulting in a positive charge. The negatively charged ions are called <i>anions</i>, and the positively charged ions are <i>cations</i>. In Greek, <i>anion</i> means "thing going up," which describes the movement anions make during the chemical process of electrolysis.</p></div></div>`;
