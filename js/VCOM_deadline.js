At work and school, most projects have <i>deadlines</i>. If you don’t get your paper in by the <i>deadline</i>, you won’t get a good grade.</p><p class="long">If you think missing a deadline and getting a low grade is bad, think about how this word came to be: It was a line that went around a prison and if a prisoner crossed it, he could be shot. Now that’s a deadline! A deadline sounds scary, and it does frighten a lot of people — if you don't get a paper in by the deadline, you could lose points or fail. But hey, you’ll live.</p></div>`;
