When you buy a hundred boxes of macaroni and cheese that are on sale, you'll need to make room in the <i>pantry</i> for them.</p><p class="long">Not every kitchen has a pantry, a dedicated space for storing food and other supplies. In some cases a pantry is a closet or cupboard with shelves, and sometimes a pantry is an entirely separate room adjacent to the kitchen. The Anglo-French source of <i>pantry</i>, <i>panetrie</i>, means "bread room," from the Medieval Latin <i>panataria</i>, "room of a servant in charge of food or bread." The Latin root, <i>panis</i>, means "bread."</p></div>`;
