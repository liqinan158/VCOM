You might pass from a small museum through a <i>passageway</i> to an outdoor sculpture garden, for example.</p><p class="long">Passageways typically connect rooms or buildings to each other, and they're generally walled and slightly narrow. A passageway in a hotel might lead from an elevator to your fancy suite, and a castle might be full of stone passageways leading from room to room, some of them hidden in the walls. This noun is American in origin, from <i>passage</i> and its French root <i>passer</i>, "to go by" and <i>way</i>, "road or path."</p></div></div>`;
