An art exhibit that cover an artist's entire career is called a <i>retrospective</i> because it looks back at the work the artist has produced over many years.</p><p class="long"><i>Retro-</i> means back, <i>-spect-</i> means look (think: spectacles), so the word means literally 'a looking back.' Many people take a retrospective look at their lives on birthdays or on New Year's Eve to evaluate events and see how well they've met their goals. You could call the yearly evaluation you get from your boss a retrospective review of your work.</p></div>`;
