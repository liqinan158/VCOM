The Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra said, “Blessings on him who invented sleep, the mantle that covers all human thoughts.” Here, sleep is described as a mantle blanketing over the mind. <i>Mantel</i> is a variation of <i>mantle</i>, but it very specifically describes the shelf above a fireplace.</p></div>`;
