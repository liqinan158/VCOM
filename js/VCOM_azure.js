Try <i>azure</i>.</p><p class="long">Some people might describe the color <i>azure</i> as sapphire in hue, but in fact there's another gem responsible for this word. At its root, <i>azure</i> comes to us from a French mistranslation of the Arabic word <i>(al)-lazaward</i>, which means “lapis lazuli” — the dazzling deep blue stone that's very common in Afghanistan. The Arabic word actually refers to an area of Turkestan where Marco Polo collected lapis lazuli for friends back home.</p></div></div>`;
