I'm sure you can think of harsher and more obscene examples, but we won't get into them here.</p><p class="long"><i>Invective</i> comes from the Latin for "abusive."  It kind of sounds like a harsh word, actually, with those sharp, dagger-like V's.  People usually put a colorful verb or phrase before it. Some examples: "She spewed invective," "She hurled invective," "She burst forth into invective."  You can follow it with a phrase like, "picking up her plate and throwing it across the room."</p></div>`;
