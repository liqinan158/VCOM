The word actually is a combination of <i>wild</i> plus the Old English word <i>dēor,</i> along with the ending <i>-ness</i>, used in nouns that refer to a certain condition. While <i>dēor</i> eventually turned into our modern word <i>deer</i>, it didn’t refer to the antlered Bambi we imagine. It was simply the word for “animal.”</p></div></div>`;
