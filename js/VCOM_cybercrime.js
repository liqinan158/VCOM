Computer hacking and using the Internet to steal credit card numbers are both kinds of <i>cybercrime</i>.</p><p class="long">When criminals use a computer that's connected to the Internet to commit a crime, it's considered cybercrime. If you have your identity stolen after entering information on a website you think is secure, you're a victim of cybercrime. Malware or computer viruses are another type of cybercrime.
