You might accuse your best friend of being a <i>fuddy-duddy</i> if she prefers staying home drinking tea and reading on Saturday nights, instead of going dancing with you.</p><p class="long">A fuddy-duddy has no sense of humor and is disapproving and a bit pompous. Fuddy-duddies seem dull and conservative, overly careful, and critical of other people's decisions. While we know <i>fuddy-duddy</i> first appeared in print in the late 1800s, and that it originated in the United States, its origin is a mystery.</p></div>`;
