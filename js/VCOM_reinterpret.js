You thought that when Brian said, "I love you," he meant as a friend, but you may want to <i>reinterpret</i> the meaning of those words since he bought you a diamond ring.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>reinterpret</i> also means to re-explain or interpret from a different point of view. Each year, historians try to reinterpret the primary source material in historical cases. For example, in 1892, Lizzie Borden's father and step-mother were killed with an ax. Lizzie was acquitted. Did she commit the crime? Well, historians examine and reexamine the evidence and interpret it and reinterpret it. Some think she did it and some think she was innocent. We may never know.</p></div>`;
