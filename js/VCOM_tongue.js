What a useful member of the body!</p><p class="long"><i>Tongue</i> supposedly came from the Latin word <i>lingua</i>, meaning "language," but you can't hear the similarity because we pronounce it TUNG, keeping the "ue" silent. A tongue can be anything shaped like your tongue. The flap of leather under your shoelaces is called a tongue, and so is the striker inside a bell. <i>Tongue</i> also means language, like the German tongue, or the Cajun tongue. As a verb, <i>tongue</i> means "lick," as in when the dog tongues your empty plate.</p></div></div>`;
