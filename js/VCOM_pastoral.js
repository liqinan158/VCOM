If you draw cheery pictures with lush fields, calm skies, cheerful bunnies, and colorful wildflowers, you draw <i>pastoral</i> scenes.</p><p class="long"><i>Pastoral</i> can also describe something done by, you guessed it, a pastor. If a pastor writes a letter to his congregation, it is a pastoral letter. How are the two meanings of <i>pastoral</i> related? Shepherds, of course. Pastors are often referred to as shepherds of their flock (i.e., the members of their church congregation). Actual shepherds, the kind who tend sheep, work in pastoral settings.</p></div></div>`;
