For example, you might find an old <i>misshapen</i> Barbie, with messy hair and missing limbs, at the bottom of a toy chest.</p><p class="long">Things that are so malformed or distorted that they look weird or ugly are misshapen. Ballet dancers sometimes end up with misshapen feet after years of cramming them into <i>pointe</i> shoes, and when you grow your own vegetables in your back yard, you often end up with misshapen ones that taste delicious. <i>Misshapen</i> comes from the Old English roots <i>mis</i>, "wrong," and <i>scapan</i>, "to create or form."</p></div>`;
