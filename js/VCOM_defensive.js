When a person is acting defensive, they're trying to protect or justify themselves. People who are insecure or guilty tend to act defensive. Also, defensive players in football try to prevent the other side from scoring, just like defensive military strategies try to protect something. When someone has a defensive attitude, or is forced to defend something, we also say they're "on the <i>defensive</i>."</p></div>`;
