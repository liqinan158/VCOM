Really big sailboats have more than one <i>mast</i>. A <i>mast</i> is also another name for flagpole.</p><p class="long">The mast has an important job — to support the sails, which allows the wind to propel the ship. Other types of masts are used to support flags and called flagpoles. If you've ever seen a flag at half-mast, it's been lowered down the flagpole to show respect for someone who died. <i>Mast</i> is an old word meaning “pole or rod.”</p></div></div>`;
