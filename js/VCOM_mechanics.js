If you're a physicist and your specialty is <i>mechanics</i>, you most likely study the way physical bodies are affected by forces and how they affect their environment.</p><p class="long">Mechanics is one branch of physics â€” and some mathematicians are also focused on mechanics. You can divide this field of study into classical mechanics and quantum mechanics, but in either case it involves the study of motion and the forces that cause or result from motion. You can also use the noun <i>mechanics</i> when you talk about the inner workings or details of something, like the mechanics of baseball or the mechanics of the banking industry.</p></div></div>`;
