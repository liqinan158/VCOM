These castings, used in a wide variety of everyday machines, systems, and appliances, are made in a foundry, where hot molten metal is poured into a mold and allowed to harden. Some foundries are distinguished specifically for what they produce, like a type foundry, which makes typefaces for printing presses.</p></div>`;
