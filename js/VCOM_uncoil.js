You can even call it a <i>coil</i>, like a coil of rope on the deck of a sailboat. Make it straight by untwisting it, and you uncoil it: "Leave my snake alone! Don't try to uncoil her!" The prefix <i>un-</i> means "reverse or opposite of," and <i>coil</i>, "gather into rings," comes from a root meaning "to gather or collect."</p></div>`;
