Most <i>moralists</i> are offended when other people don't share their values.</p><p class="long">Morals — personal beliefs about what is good or acceptable behavior — are extremely important to a moralist. In fact, moralists tend to feel so strongly about their own rules that they expect others to follow them precisely. The earliest meaning of <i>moralist</i> was simply "moral person," although it came to mean "person who moralizes," or makes authoritative comments on moral issues, often with a sense of superiority. The Latin root word, <i>moralis</i>, means "pertaining to morals."</p></div>`;
