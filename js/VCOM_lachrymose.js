To be <i>lachrymose</i>, in other words, is to be tearful.</p><p class="long"><i>Lachrymose</i> is not a word used much in everyday speech; you wouldn't say, for example, "I feel a bit <i>lachrymose</i> today." No, you'd probably say, "I feel a bit weepy today." <i>Lachrymose</i> is generally confined to use as a written critical term, often meaning much the same as <i>sentimental.</i> Books and plays and films can all be lachrymose, if their intent is to induce shameless sniveling.</p></div>`;
