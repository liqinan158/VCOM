A true <i>blockbuster</i> is extremely popular and brings in a lot of money.</p><p class="long">Typically, a blockbuster is a fabulous summer movie that audiences line up to see the first weekend it's released. You can also call a successful play or a new, popular video game a <i>blockbuster</i>. Less, often, a huge bomb is a <i>blockbuster</i> â€” this is the word's original, 1940s meaning, from the fact that such a bomb could destroy an entire city block. The entertainment meaning, from the 1950s, began as theater slang.</p></div></div>`;
