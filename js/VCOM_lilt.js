You might love old fashioned big band jazz because of its distinctive <i>lilt</i>.</p><p class="long">Upbeat, rhythmic music of any kind has a lilt, and you can also describe certain ways of speaking as having a lilt. In this case, the lilt is either the rhythm of a person's speech, or her accent â€” an Irish accent is often called an "Irish lilt." <i>Lilt</i> can be a verb, too, as when you lilt out a song. The earliest meaning of the word was "to lift up one's voice," from the West Midlands <i>lulten</i>, "to sound an alarm."</p></div></div>`;
