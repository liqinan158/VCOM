So if you routinely steal your neighbor's newspaper, don't be surprised to be on the receiving end of his <i>ire</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Ire</i> comes almost directly from the Latin word for anger, <i>ira.</i> While it means pretty much the same thing, <i>ire</i> usually stems from a specific grievance, rather than just general irritation with the world. And if you provoke someone's ire, you're probably going to feel their wrath. Shakespeare used both <i>ire</i> and <i>anger</i> in one famous sentence from his play "Pericles": "Yet cease your ire, you angry stars of heaven!"</p></div>`;
