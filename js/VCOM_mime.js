Many mimes also wear clown-like makeup, wear simple clothing, and refuse to speak. You can use the word <i>mime</i> as a verb as well, to describe what you do when you imitate your least favorite teacher for the amusement of your friends. The Greek root word is <i>mimos</i>, "imitator, actor, or buffoon."</p></div>`;
