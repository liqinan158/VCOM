Think fragrant roses, savory spices, freshly cut grass, or spring rain.</p><p class="long"><i>Aromatic</i> derives from the Greek <i>aromatikos</i>, meaning “sweet spice.” It is related to <i>aroma</i>, but there is one key difference between the meanings of the two words. While <i>aromatic</i> means "having a pleasant smell," <i>aroma</i> means just "smell" — that smell could be pleasant, or it could be the nastiest, mustiest, old-cheesiest smell on the planet. Say either "What is that pleasant aroma wafting from your kitchen?" or "What is that aromatic smell?" and you'll be saying essentially the same thing.</p></div></div>`;
