They make these tunnels by <i>burrowing</i>, or digging holes with their bodies.</p><p class="long">Just one letter separates <i>burrow</i> from borrow. To remember the difference, think of the 'u' in <i>burrow</i> as the 'u' for under. Burrows are always underground, and when you burrow under something, you are always going beneath it. Worms can burrow into apples, and on a cold day, you might decide that you'd rather stay in and burrow underneath your blankets.</p></div></div>`;
