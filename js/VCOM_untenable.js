If your disagreement with your teacher puts you in an <i>untenable</i> position, you better just admit you made a mistake and get on with it.</p><p class="long">When <i>untenable</i> entered English in the 17th century it meant "unable to be held against attack." That sense still holds true: you can use the adjective <i>untenable</i> to describe any situation, position, or theory that simply can't be defended. <i>Untenable</i> is a great word to use when you want to criticize something, whether it's a flawed system or a referee's bad call.</p></div></div>`;
