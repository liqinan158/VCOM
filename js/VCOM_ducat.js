If you recognize this word, you might know it from William Shakespeare’s <i>Hamlet</i>, in which the hero shouts “Dead, for a ducat, dead!” Also, <i>ducat</i> is mentioned so often in <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> that it was slang for “money” or “ticket” for a long time after. But don’t ask for your change in ducats; the cashier probably won’t know what you’re talking about.</p></div></div>`;
