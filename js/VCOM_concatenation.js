var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">concatenation</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Concatenation</i> refers to a series of things — ideas, events, animals — that are somehow interconnected, individual parts that are linked to form a single unit, like the links in a chain.</p><p class="long">If you think about a chain, you can imagine the individual links — they move separately, yet are linked so they always move together as well. This aptly describes <i>concatenation</i>, the state of several things being bound together. We can see the meaning from the word's source, the Latin <i>concatēnāre</i>. It comes from <i>catēnāre</i>, "to make a chain, to link," which itself comes from <i>catena</i>, "a chain." Add the prefix <i>con-</i>, meaning "together," and we get the meaning "to link together."</p></div>`;
