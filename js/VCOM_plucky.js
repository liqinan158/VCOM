This word describes brave people and actions, and it means about the same as <i>feisty</i> and <i>spunky</i>. It often applies to people who bravely struggle against powerful forces. A short person playing basketball is plucky. You can be plucky in fighting a terrible disease. Anyone who refuses to give up, no matter what, is plucky.</p></div></div>`;
