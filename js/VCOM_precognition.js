A feeling that your mom is about to call just before your phone rings might be <i>precognition</i> — or maybe your mom just tends to call you hourly.</p><p class="long">Belief in precognition is considered superstitious (at least by those who don't believe in it). It falls under the category of ESP or a "sixth sense," and it comes in handy as an explanation for the phenomenon of déjà vu, that feeling of having done or said something before, and of knowing what will happen next. <i>Precognition</i> comes from the Latin <i>praecognoscere</i>, "to foreknow," from <i>prae</i>, "before," and <i>cognoscere</i>, "to get to know."</p></div>`;
