When you’re getting dressed for the prom, you might fuss with your hair and your dress and generally <i>titivate</i> yourself until you’re ready to step out and make your grand entry.</p><p class="long">You can titivate your makeup or your room or you can titivate yourself — all of it in the pursuit of making something more attractive and neat. <i>Titivate</i> can also mean to make small alterations to something. You might titivate your new coat by adding cute buttons and ribbons to it. <i>Titivate</i>, which is not a very commonly used word, may have originated from the word <i>tidy</i>, formed on the pattern of words like <i>cultivate</i>.</p></div></div>`;
