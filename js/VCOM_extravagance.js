Ordering a $500 hamburger for dinner would be an <i>extravagance</i>.</p><p class="long">Money is usually the subject when people talk about <i>extravagance</i>, although the word can also mean having too much of something, whether it's anger or flowery wallpaper. In Latin, the root word <i>extravagari</i> means "wander outside or beyond," and originally <i>extravagance</i> was used to describe something that was unusual â€” "wandering outside" the norm. It wasn't until the 1700s that the word became associated specifically with spending too much money.</p></div>`;
