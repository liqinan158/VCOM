The word made an initial appearance in the 1850s meaning "street corner broker" in Wall Street slang, but thanks to Mark Twain's 1869 reference to "noble savages (and) illustrious guttersnipes," it came to mean "street urchin." Earlier, as far back as Shakespeare's time <i>snipe</i> had been used to mean "disreputable person."</p></div></div>`;
