If the sidewalk is covered in <i>soupy</i>, half-frozen slush, you'll want to wear your boots.</p><p class="long">Anything that reminds you of soup, especially in consistency, is soupy. Your favorite dish at an Indian restaurant might be a spicy, soupy mix of spinach and cheese, although you may prefer the cardamom ice cream to the soupy rice pudding for dessert. You can also use <i>soupy</i> for something that's overly sentimental or sappy: "She sent me this <i>soupy</i> Valentine's Day card, but I was hoping for chocolates."</p></div></div>`;
