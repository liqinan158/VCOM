Both adjectives describe a devotion  to one's country, but <i>jingoistic</i> implies a fanatical allegiance that goes beyond pride, and often includes aggression toward other countries. The word <i>jingo</i>, "mindless, gung-ho patriot," arose from a popular 1878 song that praised Britain's warlike stance toward Russia at the time, and came into American use in the 1890s during the Spanish-American war.</p></div></div>`;
