When you go to the symphony, you'll most likely hear <i>tympani</i> being played.</p><p class="long">Tympani, which are also known as timpani, timps, or kettledrums, are made of drum heads stretched across big metal bowls. The shape of their copper bodies explains the "kettle." The word <i>tympani</i> itself comes from the Latin root <i>tympanum</i>, or "drum." The sound of tympani is probably more familiar than you realize â€” the noise they make can sound just like thunder.</p></div></div>`;
