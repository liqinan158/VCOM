You know your painting exhibits <i>mimesis</i> when the viewers try to pick the flowers from the canvas.</p><p class="long">You’ve probably heard that life imitates art. Well, when art imitates life, it’s <i>mimesis</i>. Originally a Greek word, meaning “imitation,” <i>mimesis</i> basically means a copycat, or a mimic. Mimesis might be found in a play with a realistic setting or in a particularly life-like statue. The word is also used in biology for a disease that shows characteristics of another illness. You can remember the definition of <i>mimesis</i> by thinking about a mime imitating an action.</p></div>`;
