Like your cocker spaniel, a <i>wolf</i> is a canine. Unlike your cocker spaniel, a <i>wolf</i> isn't nice to cuddle with during a thunderstorm.</p><p class="long">You can find wolves in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America, although there are significantly fewer of them today than there once were. Conservation measures have steadied the wolf population in remote and rural areas since the 1970s, however, so they're no longer considered endangered. Wolves rarely attack humans, unless they're sick with rabies. As a verb, to <i>wolf</i> means to eat very fast â€” in other words, to eat as voraciously as a wolf.</p></div></div>`;
