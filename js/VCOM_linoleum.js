Many kitchens and bathrooms have <i>linoleum</i> floors, which kids love to slide across in their socks.</p><p class="long">Linoleum, which has been around since the late 1800's, is a smooth flooring made from linseed oil and other materials like powdered cork and wood fibers. Linoleum is durable, easy to clean with a mop, and comes in many colors. It's been largely replaced by cheaper and less flammable plastics, but many people still prefer linoleum because it's organic and non-allergenic. Linoleum's inventor coined the word, a combination of the Latin for “linen or flax,” <i>linum</i>, and <i>oleum</i>, which means "oil."</p></div>`;
