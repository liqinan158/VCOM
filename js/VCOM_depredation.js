The word <i>depredation</i> entails all of the pain humans inflict upon each other.</p><p class="long">The Latin language makes the noun <i>praeda</i> "prey" into the verb <i>praedārī</i>, which then means "to plunder." As if that wasn't enough — they added the prefix <i>de-</i>, "thoroughly," to create a word that says it all. In 15th-century French, the word became <i>depredation</i>, but the meaning was far from refined, describing a wholesale pillaging of those who became the "prey" and continuing the history of man’s inhumanity to man.</p></div>`;
