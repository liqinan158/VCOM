If you pull up at a traffic light and you see your teacher in the car next to yours and your neighbor behind you, it's an unlikely <i>concurrence</i>.</p><p class="long">The Latin root of <i>concurrence</i> is <i>concurrentia</i>, which means "a running together." You can use the noun <i>concurrence</i> to describe things that exist together or at the same time, and also when there's an agreement, especially of results or opinions, like a concurrence of opinions among the school board about spending money on a new playground, or a concurrence in your family about wanting pancakes for breakfast.</p></div>`;
