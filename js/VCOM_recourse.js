If you're failing trigonometry in spite of studying until your brain hurts, you may have no <i>recourse</i> but to hire a tutor.</p><p class="long"><i>Recourse</i> comes from the Latin word <i>recursus</i>, meaning “to run back or retreat.” People seek recourse from such difficulties as debt, illness and legal woes, so you can think of <i>recourse</i> as the words "retreating from curses" squished together.  For the record, though, the <i>cursus</i> in <i>recursus</i> means <i>course</i>, not <i>curse</i>. Actually, no one knows where the word <i>curse</i> comes from.  There may be some connection between <i>cursus</i> and <i>curses</i>, but then again, there may not be.</p></div></div>`;
