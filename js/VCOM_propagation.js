If it's used in relation to creatures, that means that the creatures are multiplying — having kids. A synonym for this is <i>procreation</i>. You can also use <i>propagation</i> for anything that multiplies and spreads through larger and larger numbers or spaces — from the propagation of weeds in your garden to the propagation of a new idea. In physics, propagation is wave movement.</p></div>`;
