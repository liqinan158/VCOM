As a verb, to <i>flame</i> is to be on fire or to flare up.</p><p class="long">On the Internet, <i>flame</i> has a different meaning: to post or send aggressive, negative, or insulting messages in a public electronic forum. "Flame wars" are exchanges of such messages between individuals or parties and often occur behind a veil of anonymity. It's an appropriate term, given that <i>inflammatory,</i> which takes <i>flame</i> as its root, describes speech or action that tends to incite a heightened and negative response.</p></div>`;
