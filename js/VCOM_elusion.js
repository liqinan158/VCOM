Your cat's <i>elusion</i> makes it hard to find her when it's time to take her to the vet.</p><p class="long">When you avoid being found or caught, that's elusion. Playing hide and seek is all about elusion, as is being a successful prison escapee. Any situation that involves a person cleverly evading detection or capture can be described as elusion, though it's much more common to hear the verb <i>elude</i>, which came first. Its original meaning was "delude or make a fool of," from a Latin root, <i>eludere</i>, "escape from or make a fool of."</p></div>`;
