One brand of <i>margarine</i> goes by the name "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter." Try it, and see if you can tell the difference...</p><p class="long">Margarine looks a lot like butter â€” it comes in sticks and in a very soft, spreadable form in a tub. Instead of the butterfat from milk being churned until it's solid (the process for making butter), margarine is made by emulsifying (thickly blending) oil with other fats and ingredients that make it creamy. Margarine was invented in the 1860s by a French scientist.</p></div>`;
