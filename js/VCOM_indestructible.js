Your <i>indestructible</i> winter boots last year after year, stomping through snow and ice and salt without ever falling apart.</p><p class="long">Things that are indestructible last for so long that it seems impossible to break them. Your relationship with your best friend might feel indestructible if your bond is strong and true, and your junky old car might also seem indestructible if it never dies no matter how many miles you drive it. The word <i>indestructible</i> comes from Latin roots, the prefix <i>in</i>, or "not," and <i>destruere</i>, "tear down or demolish" or literally "un-build."</p></div></div>`;
