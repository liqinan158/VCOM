A person could be described as <i>tempestuous</i> if she’s prone to violent mood swings and fits of passion. <i>Impetuous</i> is a synonym. The author Joseph Conrad once wrote, “To have his path made clear for him is the aspiration of every human being in our beclouded and <i>tempestuous</i> existence.”</p></div>`;
