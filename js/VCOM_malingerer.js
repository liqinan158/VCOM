Then you, my dear, are a <i>malingerer,</i> and should be ashamed of yourself. Shape up!</p><p class="long">Knowing that the prefix <i>mal</i> is from the Latin for “bad,” we can tell right off that being a <i>malingerer</i> is not a good thing. This noun form of the verb <i>malinger</i> comes from the French <i>malingre</i> which means “sickly.” (Obviously, it’s bad to pretend to be sick.) In Jack London’s <i>Call of the Wild</i>, the new dog, Pike, is referred to as “a clever <i>malingerer</i> and thief,” giving a clear negative context to the word.</p></div></div>`;
