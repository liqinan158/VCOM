The word is often followed by "to," as in "His steely personality made him <i>impervious</i> to jokes about his awful haircut."</p><p class="long">Most of the sentences you'll run across using <i>impervious</i> will be followed by the word "to" and a noun. Things are often described as being impervious to physical assaults like <i>heat, water, bullets, weather,</i> and <i>attack</i>, but just as frequently to less tangible things, like <i>reason, criticism, pain,</i> and <i>pressure</i>. The word comes from Latin: <i>in-</i> + <i>pervius</i>, meaning "not letting things through." A common synonym is <i>impermeable</i>.</p></div></div>`;
