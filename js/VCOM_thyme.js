If you're an aspiring chef, you're probably very familiar with herbs like <i>thyme,</i> rosemary, and oregano.</p><p class="long">Thyme is a common ingredient in many culinary traditions, including French and Middle Eastern food. In ancient Greece, thyme was believed to inspire courage, and it was commonly burned as incense and used in ritual baths. Before antibiotics were discovered, thyme oil was often used as an antiseptic (and the germ-killing mouthwash Listerine still includes thyme in its ingredients).  The root of <i>thyme</i> means "rise in a cloud," a possible reference to its strong scent.</p></div></div>`;
