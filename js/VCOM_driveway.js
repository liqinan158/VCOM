If there's no parking allowed on your street, you can tell visiting friends to park their cars in your <i>driveway</i>.</p><p class="long">Some driveways are only a few feet long, while others stretch for many yards to houses set far back from the public road. Homeowners are responsible for their driveways, including plowing or shoveling the snow that falls in the driveway during the winter months. You can also call your driveway a <i>drive</i>, and both words emerged in the late 19th century.</p></div>`;
