Your best friend may do her best to sway you to change your basketball allegiance from the Celtics to the Lakers, but you refuse to <i>apostatize</i>.</p><p class="long">When someone renounces their religious principles, leaving one faith for another or ceasing to believe at all, they apostatize. The Latin root, <i>apostata</i>, means "one who forsakes religion or faith." This is the most common way to use this verb, but it also works well for changes in political belief: "I never thought he'd apostatize, but he's now a registered Democrat."</p></div>`;
