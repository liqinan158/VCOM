If you love walking your dog, you'll <i>cheerfully</i> grab her leash and head out first thing in the morning.</p><p class="long">The adverb <i>cheerfully</i> is perfect for anything you do while whistling or smiling. If you do your chores with good humor, you do them cheerfully. And if you're excited and happy about making your grandparents their favorite dessert, you'll cheerfully spend the day baking a perfect apple pie. <i>Cheerfully</i> comes from <i>cheer</i>, which is defined as "optimism or joy," but originally meant "face," specifically the way the face expresses emotion.</p></div></div>`;
