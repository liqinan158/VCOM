But the term is most widely connected with religious unity, specifically Christianity. The original Greek root word, <i>oikos</i>, means "house," and that grew into the word <i>oikoumenik√≥s</i>, which means "the entire world." Today it most often refers to bringing people of diverse Christian religions together; however, an <i>ecumenical</i> service might bring Christians, Jews, and Muslims together under one roof.</p></div>`;
