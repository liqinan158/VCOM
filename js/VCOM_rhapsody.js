Your <i>rhapsody</i> about the desserts at your city's new restaurant has all of your friends drooling and dying to try them.</p><p class="long">A <i>rhapsody</i> is also part of an epic poem that is suitable for reciting. The word comes from the Greek word <i>rhapsodios</i>, which means a person who recites epic poems, and whose root is <i>rhaptein</i>, meaning to stitch. A <i>rhapsody</i> is also a musical piece noted for its improvisational nature and irregular form. Perhaps the most famous of this type of music is George Gershwin's "<i>Rhapsody</i> in Blue," composed in 1924.</p></div>`;
