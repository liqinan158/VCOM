You might decide to <i>refinish</i> the scratched and worn wood floors in your house, for example.</p><p class="long">The surfaces of wooden things, like furniture and floors, can become dull and scratched over time, or may even be painted. If you wanted to remove old paint from an oak table and make it gleam, you'd refinish it â€” sanding the surface, staining it, and possibly coating it with a layer of protective wax. <i>Refinish</i>, "apply a new <i>finish</i> to," is based in the <i>finish</i> meaning "surface appearance of a material or object."</p></div></div>`;
