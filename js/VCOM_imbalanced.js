An <i>imbalanced</i> workplace might pay men more than women for doing the same work.</p><p class="long">Something that's imbalanced is off-kilter or out of whack. It's out of balance, but not in quite the same way that the adjective <i>unbalanced</i> implies. When you describe something as imbalanced, you're likely talking about a rule, a law, or a procedure, while you might call a shaky wheelbarrow unbalanced. Things that are imbalanced are out of proportion â€” power itself is something that's frequently imbalanced.</p></div></div>`;
