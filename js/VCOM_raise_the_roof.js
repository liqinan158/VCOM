You're likely to <i>raise the roof</i>, for example, if you discover that someone's been reading your private diary.</p><p class="long">When your parents raise the roof about the mess you made in the kitchen, they get really mad. The saying <i>raise the roof</i> probably originated in the local dialect of the United States South some time in the mid-1800's, meaning "raise a ruckus" or "make an uproar." People rarely use the expression today, so it sounds a bit old-fashioned.</p></div></div>`;
