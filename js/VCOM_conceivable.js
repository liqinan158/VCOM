So, it makes sense that the adjective <i>conceivable</i> describes things that can be imagined or thought of. People often use the word <i>conceivable</i> in extreme contexts. If you look everywhere for your homework but still can't find it, you might declare, "I searched in every <i>conceivable</i> location! My homework must have disappeared." In response, your teacher might remark that disappearing homework is <i>inconceivable</i>, or "impossible to imagine."</p></div></div>`;
