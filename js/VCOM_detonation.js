Nuclear weapons cause massive <i>detonations</i>, and cities sometimes plan a careful <i>detonation</i> of an abandoned building in order to make room for a new structure.</p><p class="long"><i>Detonation</i> can be two things: the actual moment someone presses the button that creates the explosion, and then there’s the explosion itself.  Its root word is the Latin <i>detonare</i>, which means “thunder down,” and if you’ve ever heard a detonation you understand that phrase well.  Not all detonations are bad — like beautiful fireworks or the hilarious detonation of an exploding cigar.</p></div>`;
