var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">impassable</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Whether it’s a road, a barrier, a river, or an abyss, if you can’t travel through or over it, you can describe it as <i>impassable</i>.</p><p class="long">When you break apart the word <i>impassable</i>, it’s pretty easy to figure out what it means. The <i>im-</i> prefix, a variant of <i>in-</i>, may be familiar to you as a way to say “not.” And <i>passable</i> is likely pretty familiar too, referring to something that can be crossed. When you combine those parts you get something that you can’t navigate. <i>Impassable</i> is usually used in a literal sense, referring to things that you can’t travel through — like side streets after a major snow storm.</p></div>`;
