A company might release a <i>communique</i> to the local newspaper announcing the name of the new CEO.</p><p class="long">Any kind of formal announcement, report, or statement can be called a communique, especially if someone in authority issues it. Your boss might send out a communique to all her employees letting them know about a new company policy, for example. The word comes from the French <i>communiqué</i>, or "communicated," and even in English is often spelled with the French accent on the <i>e</i> — a good reminder of how it's pronounced, with a final <i>ay</i> sound.</p></div></div>`;
