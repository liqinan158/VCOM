Sculpture, flower pots, and roof tiles can all be made of <i>terra cotta</i>.</p><p class="long">Like other pottery, terra cotta is made of clay and baked in a very hot oven, or kiln. Archaeologists use the word to describe clay sculptures or figurines that aren't made on a potter's wheel but are molded by hand. <i>Terra cotta</i> is also used to refer to the red-brown color itself.
