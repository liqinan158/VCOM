When your big brother or sister starts kindergarten, you may <i>bewail</i> the fact that they can't play with you all day anymore but you'll be excited when you get to go to school also!</p><p class="long">The verb <i>bewail</i> is from the Old Norse word <i>v√¶la</i>, meaning to lament. The prefix <i>be-</i> is added when you want to make something stronger or more intense. So <i>bewail</i> means to greatly lament and when compared to <i>bemoan</i>, a word with similar meaning, <i>bewailing</i> would be louder and more intense. You can bewail the death of a friend, but if you bewail a minor irritation like a broken nail, people will accuse you of being overly dramatic.</p></div></div>`;
