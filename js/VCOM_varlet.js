In paintings of young knights, there is often a trusty <i>varlet</i> at his side.</p><p class="long">If you heard someone say, "Varlet! Bring me my hauberk!" you could be sure you'd either traveled back in time to the Middle Ages or were at a Renaissance Fair. A varlet was similar to a squire, a servant and sidekick who could be relied on for help when a knight was just starting out. Later, <i>varlet</i> came to have the additional meaning of "rascal or rogue," possibly influenced by Shakespeare, who frequently used it as an insult.</p></div></div>`;
