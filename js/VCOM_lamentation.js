At the funeral, you could hardly hear the speaker above the wails of <i>lamentation</i>.</p><p class="long">From the Latin <i>lamenta</i>, meaning “weeping” or “wailing,” <i>lamentation</i> means more than just shedding a few tears.  Lamentation is when grief pours out.  If you lose a nice pencil that's no cause for lamentation, but if you lose all your money in a stock market crash, that might be. If someone tells you you'll be late to your own funeral, you can always say: “At least I'll get to enjoy the lamentation!”</p></div></div>`;
