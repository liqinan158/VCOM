A <i>low-key</i> wedding might be held in a friend's backyard, with a potluck reception â€” it's informal, small, and subdued.</p><p class="long">A person who's low-key is modest and soft spoken, and a low-key restaurant is comfortable and unpretentious. You might prefer your family's low-key way of celebrating birthdays (a cake and a few gifts) to the way your best friend's family does it (hiring caterers, clowns, magicians, and a band). <i>Low-key</i> can also mean "muted in color," like the low-key tones in your favorite painting.</p></div></div>`;
