Your nephew might insist on wearing his red <i>kerchief</i> and cowboy boots everyday to preschool.</p><p class="long">Another word for a kerchief is a <i>bandana</i>. While some people wear them as protection from the sun or to cover their hair for religious reasons, many kerchief wearers simply like the style. The word comes from an Old French root, <i>couvrechief</i>, which literally means "cover head," from a combination of <i>couvrir</i>, "cover," and <i>chief</i>, "head." Related words include <i>neckerchief</i> and <i>handkerchief</i>.</p></div>`;
