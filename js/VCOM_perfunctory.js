If you give someone a gift and they look at it like it's roadkill and say nothing but a <i>perfunctory</i> "thank you," you might not be giving them another one anytime soon.</p><p class="long">A person who does something in a perfunctory way shows little enthusiasm or interest in what they are doing. Many of our everyday greetings are perfunctory. For example, when we say "Hello" and "How are you?", we usually do so out of habit. <i>Perfunctory</i> is from Latin <i>perfunctus,</i> from <i>perfungi</i>, "to get through with, perform," formed from the Latin prefix <i>per-</i>, "completely," plus <i>fungi</i>, "to perform."</p></div>`;
