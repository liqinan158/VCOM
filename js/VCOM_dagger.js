During the Late Middle Ages, <i>daggers</i> were a sort of back-up to the longer sword, both carried during battles.</p><p class="long">Most daggers have a sharp, pointed blade and a handle with a "crossguard" that protects a fighter's hand from sliding forward and getting cut. Throughout history, various kinds of daggers have been used in close combat. The word comes from the Old French <i>dague</i>, though its origin beyond that isn't known. The ancient last name <i>Dagard</i>, dating from the 13th century or earlier, meant "one who carries a dagger."</p></div>`;
