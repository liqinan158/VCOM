A <i>characteristic</i> of classical-style architecture is large stone columns. A <i>characteristic</i> of poodles is their pom-pom like tails.</p><p class="long">A characteristic feature needn't just be a something physically apparent, it can describe a type of personality or atmosphere as well, as in: "The <i>characteristic</i> of all funeral homes is their gloomy air." As their spelling and meaning implies, there is a close link between the words <i>characteristic</i> and <i>character,</i> meaning the essential nature of a thing, and in fact both words come from the ancient Greek <i>kharackter,</i> meaning a "symbol or imprint on the soul."</p></div></div>`;
