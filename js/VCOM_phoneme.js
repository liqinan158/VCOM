Changing a <i>phoneme</i> in a word changes that way that word is pronounced, as well as its meaning.</p><p class="long">In English, phonemes include short and long vowels, consonants, and other sounds like <i>th</i> and <i>sp</i>. The distinct sounds associated with each of the 44 phonemes in English help to differentiate words and give clues to their meaning and pronunciation. The word <i>phoneme</i> was coined in 1889 from the French <i>phonème</i>, which came from the Greek <i>phōnēma</i>, "a sound made."</p></div></div>`;
