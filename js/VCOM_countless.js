If you have <i>countless</i> reasons why you love living in New York, there are so many reasons that you can't list them all.</p><p class="long"><i>Countless</i> is a good adjective to use when you want to emphasize how endless, huge, or immeasurable something is. Your could say that smoke detectors save countless lives each year, or that your principal has tried countless times to ban soda at school, only to be outvoted by the student council over and over. The word dates from the 16th century, from the verb <i>count</i>, with its Old French root, <i>conter</i>, "add up."</p></div>`;
