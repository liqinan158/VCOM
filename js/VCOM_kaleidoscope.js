He took the name for his ever-changing picture tube from the Greek words <i>kalos</i>, "beautiful," combined with <i>eidos</i>, "shape." The "scope" part came from the Greek verb <i>skopein</i>, "to look," which can be found in many words referring to looking, including "telescope" and "microscope." The poet Lord Byron broadened the meaning of the word, giving it the sense of a "constantly changing pattern."</p></div>`;
