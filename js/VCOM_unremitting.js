It's that the heat is <i>unremitting</i>––you don't get a break from it. It's sweltering hot day after day after day.</p><p class="long">You'd think the word <i>unremitting</i> would be connected to the word remit, but that's true in only a loose way. <i>Remit</i> means to send back––but if you remit a debt, you forgive it, or lift it. <i>Unremitting</i> describes something that is never lifted or sent back. Like the Energizer Bunny, it keeps coming and coming and coming.</p></div>`;
