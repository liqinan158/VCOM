If your dog is aggressive, you might have to put a <i>muzzle</i> on her when you take her to the dog park.</p><p class="long"><i>Muzzle</i> comes from the Latin <i>morsus</i> meaning "bite." A muzzle is the nose and mouth of an animal like a cat or dog. It's also the name for a guard made of straps or wire that's worn over this part of an animal's face to keep it from biting. It's the mouth of a gun, too. If you muzzle someone, you gag him to prevent him from speaking.</p></div>`;
