You should be <i>cautious</i> crossing a busy street, or <i>cautious</i> borrowing your sister's new shoes without asking.</p><p class="long">A fusing of <i>caution</i> and <i>ous</i>, the adjective <i>cautious</i>is the opposite of hasty and rash. It actually comes from the Latin word <i>cautus</i>, which means "careful" or "heedful." Cautious people always take their time, always approach decisions thoughtfully, and never "throw caution to the wind." All that wariness may sound tedious, but as Confucius said, "The cautious seldom err."</p></div></div>`;
