If you hear a <i>disembodied</i> voice coming from your basement, it's spooky and ghostly, with no visible shape or form.</p><p class="long">Use the adjective <i>disembodied</i> to describe something that's separate from any substantial structure. A magic trick might make it appear that a disembodied head is floating in the air, and a mysterious voice or cry ringing out in the night would also seem to be disembodied. The root of <i>disembodied</i> is the verb <i>embody</i>, which had the earliest meaning of "invest a soul or spirit with a physical form."</p></div></div>`;
