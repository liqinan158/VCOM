A piano virtuoso, for example, is able to play and improvise at the highest level possible. People can also display virtuosity in speaking, in writing computer code, in cooking, or in other skills. In the late fifteenth century, <i>virtuosity</i> specifically meant "manly qualities," from the Latin root <i>virtutem</i>, "manliness, valor, or excellence."</p></div>`;
