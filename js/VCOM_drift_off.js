If you woke up early this morning, you may <i>drift off</i> as you lounge on the couch watching TV tonight.</p><p class="long">To drift off is to be taken and carried into sleep, the way a boat might drift away on the water. Like other phrases formed with <i>drift</i>, including <i>drift apart</i>, this one implies passive rather than deliberate movement. You may find yourself starting to drift off while you sit through a boring lecture, or when you're extremely sleepy, as your head first hits the pillow in your bed at night.</p></div></div>`;
