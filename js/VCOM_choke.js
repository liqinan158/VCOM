Your dad's rude joke might make you gasp and <i>choke</i> on your grilled cheese sandwich.</p><p class="long">You might choke in a smoky room, or choke on a grape that's lodged halfway down your throat. In either case, your body can't get enough oxygen. People also choke up with emotion, figuratively choking on their sobs. Likewise, a child might complain, "This scarf <i>chokes</i> me!" â€” it's uncomfortably tight, but he's not literally unable to breathe. When the weeds in your garden outnumber the vegetables, you can also say they <i>choke</i>, or crowd, your plants.</p></div>`;
