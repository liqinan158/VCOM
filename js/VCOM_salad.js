However, some <i>salads</i> don't have any greens but instead have lots of mayo — like tuna salad or chicken salad.</p><p class="long">While your idea of a salad might be iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, croutons, and a creamy dressing, salads come in many different forms. You can make a pasta salad or a tuna salad or an egg salad. Other salads are based on big pieces of bread, or meat, or cheese — and still others are dessert salads made with gelatin or whipped cream and fruit. <i>Salad</i> comes from the Latin phrase <i>herba salata</i>, or "salted vegetables."</p></div>`;
