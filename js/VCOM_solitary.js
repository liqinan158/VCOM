var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">solitary</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If you're a lone wolf, a one-man band, a rugged individualist, or an island unto yourself, you prefer to be <i>solitary</i> â€” in other words, alone or single. The term can be used to describe a person, a place, or a thing.</p><p class="long"><i>Solitary</i> comes to us from the Latin <i>solus</i>, which means alone. Note its similarity to words like <i>solo</i> and, for all you card players out there, <i>solitaire</i>. You can take a solitary walk, during which you don't utter a solitary word, but pause to admire a solitary green shoot peeping through the snow. <i>Solitary</i> is also common in the prison world: Inmates on Alcatraz who were deemed too dangerous to mingle with their fellows were put in solitary confinement cells.</p></div>`;
