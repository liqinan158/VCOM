A <i>perspicacious</i> child can't be fooled when her parents try to keep a secret by talking in Pig Latin.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>perspicacious</i> is a long word for a short definition: "keen" or "shrewd." This word is descended from the Latin word <i>perspicere</i>, which means "to look closely." In other words, if you look closely at something you are paying attention to it and know it well. A definition of <i>perspicacious</i> that is out of date but still relevant is "having keen eyesight" and people who can see clearly are also aware and attentive!</p></div>`;
