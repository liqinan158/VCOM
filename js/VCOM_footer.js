When the page numbers of the novel you're reading are printed at the bottom of the pages, you can call those footers too. A <i>footnote</i> is different from a <i>footer</i>, although both come at the end of a page — footnotes appear less regularly, and each one is different, while a footer follows a regular pattern.</p></div>`;
