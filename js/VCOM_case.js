Your teacher might say, "In your <i>case</i>, I think you should go right into the calculus class."</p><p class="long">A case is one particular situation â€” and it's also a legal term for a court proceeding, and a medical term for the details of one specific patient. Another kind of case is a bag that holds or covers something, like a laptop case or a cellphone case. When <i>case</i> is a verb, it means "to scope out a location for burglarizing it later." These various meanings come from two Latin roots: <i>casus</i>, "chance or occasion," and <i>capsa</i>, "box."</p></div></div>`;
