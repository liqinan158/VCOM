In the game called dominoes, sides of the dominoes with equal numbers are matched. Dominoes are also stood up to create elaborate patterns that look pretty impressive when theyâ€™re knocked down. If you set them up right, knocking down the first domino will knock down hundreds and even thousands of others. This use of dominoes inspired the <i>domino effect</i>, when one action inevitably causes others.</p></div></div>`;
