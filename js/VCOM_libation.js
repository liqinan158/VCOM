It might seem wasteful, but it’s really a powerful symbolic act called a <i>libation</i> — and it’s worth every drop.</p><p class="long">In ancient Greece, anyone could make a libation as a sacrifice in hopes that the gods would see it and be pleased.  Today some people offer libations in memory of a loved one that has died.  One sip for you, one for your homies, as the saying goes.  <i>Libation</i> is also a joke term for an alcoholic drink, so you could make a cocktail and call it "a <i>libation</i>."</p></div>`;
