If you like the sound of all of those trees, some jobs associated with <i>forestry</i> include conservationist, park ranger, and timber manager.</p><p class="long">The word <i>forestry</i>, defined in the 17th century as "privilege of a royal forest," comes from the  Medieval Latin <i>forestem silvam</i>, "the outside woods." By the mid-1800s, the word began to be used for "science of managing forests," a meaning it still holds today. The term actually covers a lot of (heavily forested) ground, including preserving endangered trees, protecting the habitats of animals that depend on forests, and keeping humans safe from forest fires.</p></div>`;
