They may look cute, but they can still sting you.</p><p class="long">A bumblebee is a completely different species than a honeybee, though it does make honey. Bumblebees produce honey in much smaller quantities, and it isn't harvested and eaten by people. Bumblebees also live in smaller groups, of up to four hundred bees, compared to honeybees' hives that have as many as 60,000 bees. In some places, they're called <i>humblebees</i>, from the Middle English <i>humbul-be</i>, which echoes the "hum" of a bee.</p></div></div>`;
