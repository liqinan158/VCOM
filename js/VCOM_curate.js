If you’ve ever heard a minister lead a church service, then you’ve witnessed a <i>curate</i> at work.</p><p class="long">Although the word <i>curate</i> originally could mean anyone who was taking care of church property in some way, nowadays it generally refers to those people with religious training in the church. <i>Curate</i> comes from the word <i>cure</i>; a curate is supposed to cure that most important part of you — your soul. Just as a curate cares for the parish, to <i>curate</i> can also mean to care for or manage an exhibit — such as one in an art museum.</p></div></div>`;
