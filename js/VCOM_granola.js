Many people eat <i>granola</i> with yogurt. Hippies love it.</p><p class="long">We have the great cereal man W.K.Kellog to thank for the word <i>granola</i>, probably from the word <i>grain</i>. The word was originally coined as a trademark (now lapsed) in the 19th century. Although granola is just a delicious food, it’s associated with liberal planet-loving tree huggers, and not always in a good way. If you’re wearing socks with sandals and have a few leaves in your long, uncombed hair, people might tell you you’re "looking <i>granola</i>." Because you are.</p></div>`;
