If you are fluent in French, you have a <i>mastery</i> of the language. If you win every game of chess, you show a <i>mastery</i> of the game.</p><p class="long"><i>Mastery</i> is from <i>master</i>, who is someone knowledgeable about a subject, like a master painter. Masters are also people with power â€” butlers sometimes call their employer master. Mastery refers to a similar power or ability. Beethoven showed mastery in composing. Shakespeare displayed mastery in writing. Apple has had mastery over the field of computers and smartphones. Often, both senses are mixed: if someone has mastery over a field skill-wise, they probably have mastery in terms of dominance too.</p></div>`;
