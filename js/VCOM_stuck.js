If your foot gets <i>stuck</i> in the mud, it means you can't get your foot out of its messy trap.</p><p class="long">The lid of a jar can be stuck, and your car can get stuck in traffic; either way, the thing that's stuck isn't going anywhere. You can also use <i>stuck</i> when you can't figure out what to do: you can be stuck on an especially hard math problem or feel stuck in a complicated relationship. The verb <i>stick</i> comes from the Old English <i>stician</i>, pierce or remain fastened.</p></div></div>`;
