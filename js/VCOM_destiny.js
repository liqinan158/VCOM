You might think it's your <i>destiny</i> to own a dog, but your sad goldfish survival rate should tell you that happy pets probably aren't in your future.</p><p class="long">A noun meaning <i>fate</i>, <i>destiny</i> is synonymous with other nouns like <i>divine decree</i>, <i>fortune</i>, and <i>serendipity</i>. There's no avoiding destiny — it's going to happen no matter what you do. But before you get bogged down worrying about what the distant future holds, remember what Winston Churchill said: “It is a mistake to look too far ahead. Only one link in the chain of destiny can be handled at a time.”</p></div>`;
