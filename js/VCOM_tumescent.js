An overripe peach could be described as <i>tumescent</i>, swollen and bursting with juice.</p><p class="long">You'll often find the adjective <i>tumescent</i> describing body parts swelling with sexual excitement, but it can be used for anything that's distended or enlarged. Ripe fruit, puffy hairdos, bloated bellies â€” all of these are tumescent. Things can be figuratively tumescent too, like an actor's tumescent ego, or overblown, florid, tumescent writing: "I couldn't help giggling when she read her <i>tumescent</i> poetry aloud." The Latin root is <i>tumere</i>, "to swell."</p></div></div>`;
