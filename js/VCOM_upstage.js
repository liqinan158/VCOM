If you try to <i>upstage</i> your <i>Grease</i> costar, you'll attempt to pull the audience's attention away from him and onto you at the back of the stage doing cartwheels.</p><p class="long">A child actor might accidentally upstage an adult simply by being adorable, or a minor character could upstage the star of a play with an amazing performance. When you upstage someone, the audience's focus shifts from that person to you. Another way to use the verb <i>upstage</i> is to describe the acting technique of moving back on the stage, away from the audience, so that another actor must turn her back toward them.</p></div>`;
