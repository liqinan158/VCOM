Try batting or fluttering your <i>eyelashes</i> to get attention. You'll either get what you want or look silly, or both.</p><p class="long">Eyelashes are small, usually dark and curved, and having plenty of long, lush eyelashes is considered attractive in everyone, male or female. The combination of your blinking eyelids and the fringe of eyelashes helps keep small particles out of your eyes â€” and eyelashes are sensitive in a similar way to a cat's whiskers, so that your eyes will shut reflexively when some object comes too close.</p></div></div>`;
