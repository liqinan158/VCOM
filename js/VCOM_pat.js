Dogs like getting a pat on the head, or maybe a pat of butter from the dinner table. When it's an adjective, pat means "way too simple" or "glib," as in "I asked a serious question â€” please don't give me a <i>pat</i> answer." To "have something down <i>pat</i>" is to know it by heart.</p></div></div>`;
