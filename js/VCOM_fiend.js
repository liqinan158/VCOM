They may try to steal your soul, or perhaps just want to hurt your feelings.  Either way, <i>fiends</i> never mean you well.</p><p class="long">The Old English root word for <i>fiend</i> translates to “an enemy, the devil, a demon”: three cruel characters that would delight in causing you harm.  Watch out for fiends like them.  A less wicked type of fiend is one who loves something so much that it’s scary, like a sugar-addicted jelly bean fiend, or a snowboarding fiend.  Fiend is a good example of the “<i>i</i> before <i>e</i> except after <i>c</i>” rule, so follow that and you’ll always spell it right.</p></div></div>`;
