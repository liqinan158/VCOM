After a humiliating loss in the first game of the World Series, your favorite baseball team had the <i>last laugh</i> when they swept the next four games and won the series.</p><p class="long">Having the last laugh is a kind of vindication â€” you have to go through some unpleasantness first, often being ridiculed or considered a failure, before ultimately triumphing. Many movie plots rely on the satisfaction of a character getting the last laugh, like a scientist whose belief in aliens is mocked until the day a UFO lands in her home town, or an unpopular kid at school who has the last laugh after being voted class president.</p></div></div>`;
