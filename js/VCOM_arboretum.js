The concept of the arboretum goes back even further than the word itself, all the way to the ancient pharoahs of Egypt, who raised and studied trees from other lands. The oldest known arboretum in the Western world is the Trsteno Arboretum, in Trsteno, Croatia, which was established in the 15th century.</p></div>`;
