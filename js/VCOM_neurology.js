A medical student who is interested in <i>neurology</i> will learn about strokes, epilepsy, and other nervous system disorders.</p><p class="long">The nervous system is made up of the brain, spinal cord, nerves, and ganglia throughout the body. Neurology involves the structure and function of these parts, and it also investigates diseases and disorders involving them.
