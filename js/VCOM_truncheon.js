If you find yourself face-to-face with a <i>truncheon</i>, you better behave.</p><p class="long">A truncheon is used by a police officer as a less deadly weapon than a gun. Just the sight of a police officer's truncheon is enough to make most people cooperate, but police are trained to use a truncheon to neutralize a violent suspect. Truncheons are also called batons, billy clubs, and nightsticks. The word <i>truncheon</i> comes from the Old French <i>tronchon</i>, "a broken off piece" or "a stump," is based on the Latin word <i>truncus</i>, "cut off."</p></div></div>`;
