At the end of a stressful day of work, it’s good to have some <i>guffaws</i> with your friends.</p><p class="long"><i>Guffaw</i> operates just like the word laugh: you can give a <i>guffaw</i>, or you can <i>guffaw</i>. It comes from the Scottish word <i>gawf</i>, which is onomatopoetic, meaning that it’s spelled the way it sounds. Imagine a big happy Scotsman snorting "gawf, gawf, gawf" at the end of a joke, and you’ll know what a <i>guffaw</i> is. Refined ladies and gentlemen don’t guffaw––and are much the worse for it.</p></div></div>`;
