People who have <i>dyslexia</i> have trouble matching the sounds in words with the letters and letter combinations that make those sounds.</p><p class="long"><i>Dyslexia</i> is from the Greek roots <i>dys</i>, "difficult," and <i>lexis</i>, "word." Although <i>dyslexia</i> literally means "difficulty with words," someone who has dyslexia may also have trouble in other areas like math, telling time, or even telling left and right. However, there's no lack of intelligence associated with dyslexia: famous dyslexics include Thomas Edison, John Lennon, and Whoopi Goldberg.</p></div></div>`;
