Babysitting might seem like an easy job, but depending on the kids it can actually be incredibly <i>demanding</i>.</p><p class="long">A demanding job might require a lot of physical work, like farming, or a lot of patience and diplomacy, like being a teacher or a marriage counselor. When a person is described as <i>demanding</i>, it usually means that he or she has very high standards or is especially hard to satisfy. The word comes from the Old French <i>demander</i>, "to request or demand," by way of the Latin <i>demandare</i>, "entrust."</p></div></div>`;
