The <i>ineluctable</i> conclusion is that you haven't the faintest idea what it means. <i>Ineluctable</i> means impossible to avoid.</p><p class="long">A five syllable beauty like <i>ineluctable</i> is obviously not the kind of word you throw around in daily speech. It's far more often used as a written word, as in the common phrase "ineluctable conclusion." Used interchangeably with the more common <i>unavoidable,</i> though <i>ineluctable</i> implies an unsuccessful attempt to battle against whatever is ineluctable: after all, it comes from the Latin word "to struggle."</p></div>`;
