To <i>eviscerate</i> can mean to remove the entrails of a creature. On the Discovery Channel you can watch a vulture <i>eviscerate</i> or take out the guts of a dead animal.</p><p class="long">The word <i>eviscerate</i> comes from the Latin <i>eviscerare</i>, meaning "to disembowel." It's not strictly used in such a gruesome sense though. Sure, you can eviscerate a chicken by gutting its insides, but <i>eviscerate</i> can also be used to describe when you deprive something of its most important quality. If you take away the disco ball, it could eviscerate the spirit of your dance party.</p></div>`;
