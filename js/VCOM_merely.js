If you say "I was <i>merely</i> trying to help," your efforts were probably not appreciated and you're likely to be stalking off with your nose in the air.</p><p class="long"><i>Merely</i> comes from the Latin <i>merus,</i> ("undiluted"). But "undiluted" is positive — as in, "that's the undiluted truth" — in a way that <i>merely</i> is not. When you use <i>merely,</i> it always has a negative, disapproving tinge to it: You might say, "She was merely a minor player in that drama," but if you said, "She was merely the star of the show," you would mean it ironically, since being the star is the most important role.</p></div>`;
