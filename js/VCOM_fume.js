You would <i>fume</i> if your teacher accused you of cheating when you didn't.</p><p class="long">As a verb, <i>fume</i> is usually used figuratively to mean "to feel very angry," whereas as a noun, it is used more as its Latin root <i>fumus</i> "smoke, steam, vapor." A strong-smelling gas, smoke or vapor is also called a fume. In cartoons, when a character is fuming, it is often drawn with fumes coming out of its ears. You may fume about the inconsiderate person who sits in the car with the engine running, spewing clouds of exhaust fumes.</p></div></div>`;
