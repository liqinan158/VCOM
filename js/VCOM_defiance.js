It happens when someone or a group of someones openly flouts or challenges authority.</p><p class="long">We owe this lovely descriptive term to the French — specifically to the Old French word <i>defier</i>, which means to defy. (Don't mix it up with <i>deify</i>; that means to make someone or something into a god.) If you've ever studied Latin, you'll spot the <i>fi</i> from <i>fidare</i> "to trust" that inspired the Marines' "semper fi" motto and the popular moniker for pooches––"Fido." Combining <i>fi</i> with <i>de-</i> negates it. So an act of defiance is essentially an act of not trusting.</p></div>`;
