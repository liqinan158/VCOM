A <i>follower</i> of Hinduism, for example, usually worships many gods.</p><p class="long">You might be a follower of Islam and also a follower of a popular self-help writer. In either case, you are devoted, loyal, and interested. You can also use the word <i>follower</i> to talk about someone who literally follows another person. When you play tag and the person who's "it" runs behind you as you dodge around trees, that person is a follower. The Old English root is <i>folgere</i>, "servant or disciple," from <i>folgian</i>, "follow, accompany, or pursue."</p></div></div>`;
