You can also use the noun <i>lace</i> to describe the cord you tie your sneakers with, and the verb <i>lace</i> can mean twist or braid or intertwine: "The two friends <i>lace</i> their arms around each other and skip across the playground." <i>Lace</i> is surprisingly related to <i>lasso</i>, a loop of rope carried by a cowboy â€” both words are rooted in the Latin <i>laqueus</i>, "noose or snare."</p></div></div>`;
