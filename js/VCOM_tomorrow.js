When someone says, "Children are tomorrow's leaders," it means fairly soon, not "when they wake up in the morning." Speaking of <i>morning</i>, the Old English word <i>morgen</i> means "morrow or morning," so <i>tomorrow</i> means "to morning." The morning that follows today is always tomorrow.</p></div></div>`;
