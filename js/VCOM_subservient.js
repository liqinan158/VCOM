Something that's <i>subservient</i> has been made useful, or put into the service of, something else.</p><p class="long">Our word <i>subservient</i> is unusual because it actually comes from the Latin word of exactly the same spelling and almost the identical meaning â€” "subjecting to" or "complying with." Usually words change a little in spelling or meaning when they are adopted from another language, but this one did not. Maybe the word <i>subservient</i> seemed so <i>subservient</i> that it could comply with the rules of any language!</p></div>`;
