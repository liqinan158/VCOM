Your <i>sorority</i> probably has a lot of social events such as meetings, mixers, galas, and fundraisers.</p><p class="long">First used in the 1530s, the noun <i>sorority</i> stems from the Middle Latin word <i>sororitas</i>, meaning "sisterhood, of or pertaining to sisters." Although members of a sorority aren't actually biological sisters, the idea is to form a strong bond between members — or "sisters" — based on commitment to the group. To build allegiance, members of a sorority might wear the same sweatshirts with Greek letters and attend social events and regular club meetings.</p></div>`;
