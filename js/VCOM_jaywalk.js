If you dare to <i>jaywalk</i>, you might be violating a pedestrian traffic law. Shame on you.</p><p class="long">When you jaywalk, you don't follow the rules of the road that protect pedestrians and drivers. If you dash across the street against a red light, you jaywalk. Likewise, if you meander across a busy road rather than waiting at a crosswalk, you also jaywalk. <i>Jaywalk</i> comes from <i>jay walker</i>, coined in Kansas City in 1906, from the sense of <i>jay</i> as an ignorant person. <i>Jaywalk</i> was first used in Hutchinson, Kansas in 1909.</p></div>`;
