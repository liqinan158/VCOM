Usually, we think of sad little children when we think of <i>orphans</i>, but anyone whose parents have both died is an <i>orphan</i>.</p><p class="long">A home for <i>orphans</i> is no substitute for a house with loving parents, even if they're adopted. Bambi, Annie, and Oliver Twist are probably the most famous orphans. Each lost their parents in different ways, but all of them had their lives similarly changedâ€”they felt adrift without a parent to guide them. Orphans often spend lots of time looking for friends or surrogates to fill the gap left by their deceased parents.</p></div></div>`;
