In other words, a <i>quadroon</i> had one grandparent of African descent.</p><p class="long">The word <i>quadroon</i> is seen today as being deeply offensive and completely obsolete. In the southern states of the US, particularly before the Civil War, a white person might have used the term to describe someone of mixed race, particularly if the person had one white and one racially mixed parent. The word comes from the Spanish <i>cuarteron</i>, "one who has a fourth," from <i>cuarto</i>, "fourth."</p></div>`;
