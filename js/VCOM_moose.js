You're more likely to see a <i>moose</i> in Canada than in Mexico; they like the cold.</p><p class="long">The moose is the enormous cousin of the deer, living not in groups or herds, but leading solitary lives once they leave their mothers. During mating season, males will sometimes compete over a female by slamming their impressive antlers together. In other parts of the world, moose are called "elk," but in North America the word comes from the Abenaki <i>moz</i>, whose root means "he strips off," as moose feed on bark stripped from trees.</p></div>`;
