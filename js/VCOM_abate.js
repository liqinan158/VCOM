Your enthusiasm for skiing might <i>abate</i> after falling off a ski lift and getting a mouthful of snow.</p><p class="long"><i>Abate</i> comes from the Old French verb <i>abattre,</i> "to beat down," and means to reduce or become less intense or numerous. As an intransitive verb, it is often used with something physically, emotionally, or figuratively violent, as in "the flood of fan mail began to <i>abate</i>." Using it transitively, if you take measures to abate pollution or noise, you reduce them. Pronounce <i>abate</i> with the stress on the second syllable (uh-BATE).</p></div></div>`;
