If you talk your little brother into stealing cookies from the cookie jar, you're corrupting him. Something corrupt is rotten, spoiled, or out of commission, like a file that makes your computer crash. A corrupt person — a criminal, a crook, or a cookie thief — brings society down with immoral and dishonest behavior. <i>Corrupt</i> goes back to the Latin roots <i>cor-,</i> "altogether," and <i>rumpere,</i> "break."</p></div>`;
