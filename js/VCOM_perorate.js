If you were expecting your teacher's remarks at the beginning of class to be a quick announcement, your heart will sink when he begins to <i>perorate</i>.</p><p class="long">There are two ways to use this somewhat old-fashioned word. The first is as a near-synonym of "orate," although to perorate is to give an even more flowery, pretentious speech than a mere oration. If you perorate when it's your turn to comment at a town meeting, it's unlikely you'll be taken seriously. An older meaning of <i>perorate</i> is to end a long speech with a summary of your main points.</p></div>`;
