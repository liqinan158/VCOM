That strong sense of friendship lends irony to the name of the book, and later the movie, called <i>The Amityville Horror</i>, about a horrifying town with a weirdly cheerful name. In truth, though, <i>amity</i> means "mutual understanding and peace." Wouldn't it be nice if all of the world's nations lived in amity?</p></div></div>`;
