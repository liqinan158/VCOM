Many people are born with a <i>nevus</i> somewhere on their bodies. Can you find yours?</p><p class="long">Whether you have a strawberry birthmark on your cheek, or a series of tiny moles dotting your shoulders, you can say you have a nevus. This word is most often used by doctors, including dermatologists (skin doctors), who like to keep an eye on nevi (which is the plural form of <i>nevus). Every once in a while, a nevus will develop a malignancy, or become cancerous. The Latin root of <i>nevus</i> is <i>gnaevus</i>, "born in," or "birthmark."</i></p></div></div>`;
