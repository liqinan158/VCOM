Modern <i>shanties</i> are commonly found in shantytowns, informal neighborhoods made up of crude, homemade shelters.</p><p class="long">A crude, run-down shack can be called a shanty, and the temporary, portable structures that ice fishermen set up for shelter are also shanties. This sense of <i>shanty</i> derives from the French Canadian <i>chantier</i>, or "lumberjack's headquarters." <i>Shanty</i> can also refer to a song that sailors sing while they work. This meaning comes from <i>chanty</i>, "boisterous sailor song," from the French <i>chanter</i>, "to sing."</p></div>`;
