Some people love eating unfamiliar food — things they've never tasted before — while others aren't fond of it. When something (or someone) is <i>familiar</i>, it's known to you — the word shares a Latin root with <i>family</i>. Add the "not" prefix <i>un-</i>, and you've got <i>unfamiliar</i>.</p></div>`;
