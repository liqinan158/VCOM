As the myth goes, a <i>changeling</i> was substituted by fairies.</p><p class="long">Do you ever feel like your parents might not be your real parents? Then maybe you’re a changeling. A changeling is part of a switcheroo by fairies who switch out a couple’s real baby with another baby. The new baby is the changeling. Fortunately, fairies are mythical creatures, so the concept of a changeling is also fanciful. The <i>-ling</i> part appears in many other Middle and Old English words: <i>underling, hireling, duckling</i>, and <i>yearling</i>, to name a few.</p></div></div>`;
