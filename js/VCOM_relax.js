If you want to <i>relax</i> after a crazy day at school, you might watch TV, take a nap, or do yoga to help you unwind.</p><p class="long"><i>Relax</i> can also refer to behavior that grows less formal or restrained, like a beach wedding where the bride and groom relax the usually formal ceremony by wearing casual clothing. <i>Relax</i> can also mean to become less tight. When you relax your grip on a pen, your hold loosens up. <i>Relax</i> can also refer to something that becomes less severe or strict.
