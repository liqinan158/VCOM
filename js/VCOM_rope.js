Use a <i>rope</i> to make a swing, tie a hog, or keep people out of your tree house.</p><p class="long">Ropes are handy on sailboats for tying up sails; you also use ropes for mountain climbing, lassoing a steer, raising a curtain on a theater stage, and doing aerial tricks in the circus. As a verb, <i>rope</i> means "catch with a <i>rope</i>," or colloquially, to convince someone to do something: "She'll try to <i>rope</i> me into helping with the bake sale." When you show someone "the <i>ropes</i>," you explain the way things are done.</p></div>`;
