A burglar might <i>plunder</i> a jewelry store and then sneak off with her <i>plunder.</i></p><p class="long"><i>Plunder</i> is an old Middle High German word that originally meant "household goods and clothes": in other words, your stuff. During the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), English speakers acquired this word while fighting in the land that is today Germany, but with the added meaning of taking the plunder as, well, plunder. As both a noun and verb, a synonym for <i>plunder</i> is <i>loot</i>.</p></div></div>`;
