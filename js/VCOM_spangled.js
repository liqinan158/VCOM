The American flag is called star-<i>spangled</i>, because it is full of stars.</p><p class="long">Something spangled is covered with little decorations. A shirt with rhinestones all over it is spangled. A hat with little jewels on it is spangled. A banner with beads is spangled. When something is spangled, it's been spritzed up, spruced up, and made more colorful. Something spangled is usually more interesting to look at: itâ€™s more detailed.</p></div>`;
