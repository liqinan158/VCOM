Ironically, if you utter an oath, such as a curse word or obscenity, you also <i>swear</i>.  Do you <i>swear</i> to put a quarter in this jar for every time you <i>swear</i>?</p><p class="long">The two separate meanings of <i>swear</i> come from branches of the same etymological tree. Both meanings have ties to Old Norse <i>sverja</i>, but sometime in the Middle English, the word became on one hand <i>sweren</i> with the meaning "to promise," while another version, <i>swerian</i>, became "to curse." Both might come from the idea of an oath being connected to a deity, but while one referred to truth, the other went to the dark side, negatively invoking a sacred name.</p></div></div>`;
