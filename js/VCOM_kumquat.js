If you're a fan of sour candy, you might love the taste of a fresh kumquat, and the sensation of biting through its sweet rind to a sour burst of juice at the center. Kumquats originated in China, and their name comes from the Cantonese <i>kamkwat</i>, from <i>kam</i>, "golden," and <i>kwat</i>, "orange."</p></div>`;
