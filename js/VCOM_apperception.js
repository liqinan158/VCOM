You get a perception of a chair through your eyes, but <i>apperception</i> is how your mind relates it to chairs you've seen before.</p><p class="long">We have many perceptions: information we take in through our senses, like "It's cloudy today." An apperception goes one step further by considering the perception in relation to things youâ€™ve perceived in the past. "There's Julia" is a perception, but "Julia is my friend" is an apperception, because it's based on past experience. "My stomach hurts" is a perception, but "I might throw up" is an apperception. Apperception is a sophisticated mental process that keeps developing through our lives.</p></div>`;
