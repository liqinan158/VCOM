When a baby is born, the doctor or midwife often says, "It's a girl!" or "It's a <i>boy</i>!"</p><p class="long">A boy usually grows up to be a man, just as a girl most often becomes a woman. A delivery boy is a young man whose job involves taking pizzas to people's homes, and you might call to your dog, "Here, <i>boy</i>!" unless your dog is female. <i>Boy</i> is also an exclamation: "Oh <i>boy</i>! I can't wait for my vacation next week!" The Old English root is <i>boie</i>, "boy," but also "servant" or "commoner."</p></div></div>`;
