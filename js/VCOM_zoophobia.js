If you have <i>zoophobia</i>, you probably shouldn't pursue a career as a veterinarian.</p><p class="long">This word's roots couldn't be more clear: <i>zoo-</i> relates to animals, from the Greek <i>zoion</i>, and <i>phobia</i> means "irrational fear," also from a Greek root, <i>phobos</i>. Some people with zoophobia are terrified of every non-human animal, although it's more common for zoophobia to relate to a single type of animal, like alligators or lions. In any case, if you suffer from zoophobia, the idea of visiting the zoo likely fills you with dread.</p></div>`;
