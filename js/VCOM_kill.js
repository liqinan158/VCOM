So, you could <i>kill</i> a deer by shooting it with a hunting rifle or <i>kill</i> a bill by voting against it.</p><p class="long">Hunters kill animals for their meat, and drivers sometimes kill an animal accidentally, or inadvertently kill a plant, simply by forgetting to water it. Certain inanimate things are also said to <i>kill</i>, like poison or disease or drunk driving. In each of these cases, death is caused and life is taken. You can also kill figuratively, as when a school board kills the foreign language program or a thunderstorm kills your hopes of a picnic.</p></div>`;
