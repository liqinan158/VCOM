In some parts of the country, store clerks put your stuff in a <i>sack</i>, but in other parts the same stuff goes in a bag. <i>Sack</i> is also an exciting verb.</p><p class="long">While a sack is often just a bag, as a verb it can do a lot more. A boss might sack, or fire, an employee who’s no longer needed. In American football, if you sack a quarterback, you tackle him. This comes from the other meaning of sack, which is to raid and plunder a town, like when the Visigoths sacked Rome.
