Your dog stands <i>sentry</i> over your house, but he would be more effective if he barked at strangers instead of licking their hands.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>sentry</i> came from the French <i>sentinelle</i>, which has a similar meaning.  It was in the 17th Century that the word was first associated with someone on a watchtower as a military guard.  You could only enter the dreaded ice fortress after sneaking past the sentry posted outside.  Don't let his button eyes and carrot nose fool you â€” he's a sharp one!</p></div>`;
