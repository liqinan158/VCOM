var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">incapacitate</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If you are <i>incapacitated</i>, you can’t do what you normally do, what you’re being asked to do — or perhaps, much of anything. To <i>incapacitate</i> someone is to cause him or her to be unable to function normally, like a bad cold that <i>incapacitates</i> you.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>incapacitate</i> is related to the word <i>capacity</i>. <i>Capacity</i> comes from the Latin word <i>capacitas</i>, meaning “that can contain,” or how much something — brain, bucket or otherwise — can hold. The prefix <i>in-</i> reverses the meaning and when the suffix <i>-ate</i> is added, <i>incapacitate</i> means someone has been made unable to “contain” much — like attention, effort, or energy.</p></div>`;
