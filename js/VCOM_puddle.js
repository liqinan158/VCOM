A little boy with new rain boots might decide to jump in every <i>puddle</i> he sees on his way to school.</p><p class="long">It's charming to see a puddle on a brick walkway or to watch a duck wash itself in a puddle. It's less charming to find a puddle in your basement after three days of rain. You can use <i>puddle</i> as a verb, too, to say, "I'm watching your cereal milk <i>puddle</i> in the middle of the table and wondering when you're planning to clean it up." <i>Puddle</i> comes from the Old English <i>pudd</i>, "ditch or furrow."</p></div></div>`;
