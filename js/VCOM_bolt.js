It's a quick, sharp word that either means to move quickly or refers to a stroke of lightning, as in "lightning <i>bolt</i>."</p><p class="long">The god Zeus was fond of tossing <i>bolts</i> of lightning down upon mortals who angered him. If you were one of those mortals, you'd have been smart to bolt inside as soon as the rain began. To <i>bolt</i> is to run as quickly as you can. Racehorses are often described as bolting out of the gate. Other uses of <i>bolt</i> include the lock in your door, the act of locking that lock, and what a dog does when it gulps down his food.</p></div></div>`;
