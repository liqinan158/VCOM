If you <i>consolidate</i> student loans, you put them all together into one big loan. If you <i>consolidate</i> your childhood toys, you grab them all up and put them in one place. Preferably a toy box.</p><p class="long"><i>Consolidate</i> comes from the Latin roots <i>com-</i> ("together") and <i>solidare</i> ("to make solid"). So, <i>consolidate</i> is to bring things together to make something solid, stronger, or easier to handle. A general might consolidate his troops, a librarian might consolidate his grammar books, and someone with credit-card debt might consolidate the debt from different cards onto one.</p></div></div>`;
