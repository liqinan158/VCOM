Lilliput is the name of a fictional island whose people, the Lilliputians, stand only about six inches high. In addition to acting as an adjective to describe something that is very small — like the lilliputian cups and plates in a child's doll house — <i>lilliputian</i> can also be a noun that refers to extremely small people.</p></div></div>`;
