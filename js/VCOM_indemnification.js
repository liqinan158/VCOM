Did your loud partying make your neighbors move out? You may find yourself paying an <i>indemnification</i>, meaning compensation for damages or distress.</p><p class="long">More often than not, an indemnification is usually arranged up-front as a form of insurance against bad things that might happen. For example, a film crew might agree to indemnification before being allowed to film in a particular location. Indemnification has the general sense of being a preventative action, something that protects against any future losses.</p></div>`;
