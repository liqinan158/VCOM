var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">plenitude</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The noun <i>plenitude</i> means the state of being full or complete; also, an abundance. After the thirty inches of snow your town got over the weekend, you may joke that you have a <i>plenitude</i> of snow.</p><p class="long">You can remember the meaning of <i>plenitude</i> if you remember that both <i>plenitude</i> and the word <i>plenty</i> come from the same Latin word <i>plenus</i>, meaning full or complete. Note that the spelling of <i>plenitude</i> has only one "t," although people misspell the word as <i>plentitude</i> because they closely relate <i>plenitude</i> and <i>plenty</i>. You can even find the variant spelling in some dictionaries.</p></div></div>`;
