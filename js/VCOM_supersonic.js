Seriously. <i>Supersonic</i> describes things that can travel faster than the speed of sound, like the passenger jet Concorde that used to zip from New York to London in under four hours.</p><p class="long">Anything supersonic is so fast that you see it before you hear it. A high-speed fighter jet is supersonic, but there aren't any supersonic passenger planes since Concorde's retirement in 2003. Space shuttles and modern bullets are still supersonic. Originally, the word <i>supersonic</i> meant "having to do with sound waves beyond human hearing," but by 1934 it described movement exceeding the speed of sound, with <i>ultrasonic</i> taking on the old meaning. <i>Sonic</i> comes from the Latin <i>sonus</i>, or "sound."</p></div></div>`;
