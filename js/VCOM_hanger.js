When your brother drops his jacket on the floor, you might remind him to put it on a <i>hanger</i> and hang it up in the closet.</p><p class="long">Clothes and coat hangers are common, often made from metal or wood that's bent into a triangular shape. Other hangers include picture hangers and plant hangers — really, anything from which you can hang something is a hanger. A person who does the hanging — hanging your new wallpaper, for example — is another kind of <i>hanger</i>. Be careful not to confuse these hangers with a <i>hangar</i>, which is a garage where airplanes are kept.</p></div>`;
