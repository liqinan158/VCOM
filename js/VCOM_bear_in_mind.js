When you <i>bear in mind</i> the fact that your friend is scared of heights, you won't suggest a ride on a huge Ferris wheel.</p><p class="long">Your doctor might give you a clean bill of health, adding, "<i>Bear in mind</i> that you've been sick, and take it easy for a while." When you're babysitting, you might promise the parents that you'll bear in mind the fact that their kids go crazy if they eat sugar. In either case, you're keeping a fact or an idea in your thoughts. This phrase combines the "carry or hold" meaning of <i>bear</i> with an old fashioned sense of <i>mind</i> â€” "memory."</p></div>`;
