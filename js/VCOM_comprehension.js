When you lack <i>comprehension</i> of a difficult word, you will likely need to look up its definition and usage in a cool, down-to-earth online dictionary!</p><p class="long"><i>Comprehension</i> actually comes from the Latin term, <i>comprehensionem</i>, which means "a seizing." When you have comprehension of a subject, you have seized information and incorporated it into your own knowledge. Any kind of mental grasping of an idea or a subject is a kind of comprehension. You might attempt comprehension of a curious situation, like the fact that your goofy roommate always manages to date models. Sometimes, such mysteries are beyond comprehension!</p></div></div>`;
