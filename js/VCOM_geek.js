var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">geek</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Geek</i> is a slang term for someone who is really intelligent or knowledgeable, especially about a particular topic. If you're a Star Trek geek, you know absolutely everything about the famous television show and its spin-offs. Live long and prosper!</p><p class="long">Intelligence does more good than stupidity, so the negative way people sometimes use the term <i>geek</i> seems unfair.  So if you're a geek when it comes to computers, chess, books, sports statistics, or just about anything — be proud! The Scottish root word  <i>geck</i> translates as “fool,” and many famous geeks were called fools before their ideas changed the world.  Remember, today’s geek is tomorrow’s billionaire.</p></div>`;
