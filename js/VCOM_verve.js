Dancers are noted for their <i>verve</i> on the stage. Morticians? Not so much.</p><p class="long">Similar words to <i>verve</i> include <i>vim</i>, <i>vigor</i>, and <i>Ã©lan</i>. <i>Verve</i> comes from the Latin root word <i>verba</i>, meaning "words," and in English originally meant a special talent in writing. Although the "special talent" sense is now archaic, <i>verve</i> is still an excellent choice to describe a writing style.</p></div>`;
