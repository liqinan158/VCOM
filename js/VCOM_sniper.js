The U.S. Army has a special <i>sniper</i> school for training soldiers.</p><p class="long">Sometimes criminal shooters are described as <i>snipers</i>, especially if they shoot at people from a hidden spot. However, this word most often means "trained marksman," especially someone who's trained in the armed forces or by law enforcement, like a member of a SWAT team. <i>Sniper</i> comes from the less-common verb <i>snipe</i>, "shoot birds from a hidden place," from the noun <i>snipe</i>, "long-billed marsh bird."</p></div>`;
