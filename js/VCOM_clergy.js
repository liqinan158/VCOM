If the only clerks you think of are those that work in shoe stores, think of it this way: when you join the ministry of a church, the idea is that you serve the church. <i>Clergy</i> is the word for all of the clerics combined, and is paired with the <i>laity</i>, which are all the people in the church who aren't in the clergy.</p></div></div>`;
