A cake recipe might instruct you to beat three eggs until they're <i>foamy</i>.</p><p class="long">A mug of root beer is foamy on top, and waves on a beach have a bubbly, foamy appearance too. A handful of shaving cream is foamy, and so is a dollop of whipped cream on top of your ice cream sundae. <i>Foamy</i> comes from the Old English <i>faemig</i>, "covered with foam," from <i>fam</i>, which means both "foam" and "the sea" in Old English.</p></div></div>`;
