If you need something to be <i>precise</i>, like the positioning of a safety net for a stunt jump over a canyon, there's no room for error.</p><p class="long">The word <i>precise</i> might make you think of a scientist carefully measuring the mass of a chemical for an experiment or an accountant double checking her calculations. But there's value to being precise in less formal situations as well. When making a grilled cheese sandwich, for example, itâ€™s important that the arrangement of ingredients be precise: place a tomato in each corner and ensure that the cheese covers every inch of bread so that each bite is full of gooey delight.</p></div>`;
