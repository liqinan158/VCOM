You might have spent hours choosing your first-day-of-school <i>outfit</i>.</p><p class="long">An outfit is often selected for a special occasion, like a graduation outfit, an outfit for your cousin's party, or your rodeo outfit. An <i>outfit</i> is also a kit or set of tools that serve a specific purpose, and as a verb it means "provide with" or "equip."
