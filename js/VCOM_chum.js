You and your best <i>chums</i> might spend the weekend camping together.</p><p class="long">The informal word <i>chum</i> is more common in Britain than the US, but you can still talk about your school chums or the new chum you made on a Caribbean cruise. Another kind of <i>chum</i> couldn't be more different from a buddy: it's chopped up fish parts used as bait on a fishing boat. This meaning comes from the Scottish <i>chum</i>, "food," while the first definition was Oxford University slang for a roommate or "chamber fellow."</p></div>`;
