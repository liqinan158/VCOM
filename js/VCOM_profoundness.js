The <i>profoundness</i> of your favorite movie's final moments may make you cry every single time you watch it.</p><p class="long"><i>Profoundness</i> and <i>profound</i> come from the Latin root <i>profundus</i>, which means "deep, vast," and also "obscure." This sense of obscurity, or being hard to understand, is evident in philosophical profoundness â€” you know it's deep and important, but you're not sure you totally get it. Another kind of profoundness is intensity. After you wake from a terrible nightmare, the profoundness of your fear may keep you frozen in terror for several minutes.</p></div></div>`;
