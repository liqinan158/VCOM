If you are too <i>zealous</i> in your efforts to decorate the house with Christmas lights, you might cause a power outage for the whole neighborhood.</p><p class="long"><i>Zealous</i> is the adjective for the noun <i>zeal</i>, "eager partisanship"; the latter has a long e, but <i>zealous</i> has a short one: ZEL-uhs. It can have a slightly negative connotation, and people are sometimes described as <i>overzealous</i>, meaning they try too hard. <i>Zealous</i> rhymes with <i>jealous</i> (and in fact they both derive from the same Greek word), but don't confuse them: a jealous person might be resentful of someone who makes zealous efforts to achieve success.</p></div></div>`;
