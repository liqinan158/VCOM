A stick of butter will <i>soften</i> after sitting on the counter for an hourâ€”or you can <i>soften</i> it by squishing it with a wooden spoon.</p><p class="long">You can literally soften things, the way a sculptor softens clay or you soften the skin on your hands with lotion. Turning down the sound is another way to soften something: "I'll <i>soften</i> the radio so it doesn't keep you awake." When you make something gentler or less severe, you also soften it, like when a lawmaker tries to soften the effect of a law by proposing a tax cut in return.</p></div></div>`;
