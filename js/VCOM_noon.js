Many people sit down to eat lunch right at <i>noon</i>.</p><p class="long">You can also call noon <i>midday</i>, and its opposite is midnight â€” also twelve o'clock, but falling in the middle of the night. The word <i>noon</i> comes from a Latin root, <i>nona hora</i>, or "ninth hour." In medieval times, noon fell at three PM, nine hours after a monk's traditional rising hour of six o'clock in the morning. Over time, as <i>noon</i> came to be synonymous in English with <i>midday</i>, its timing changed to twelve PM.</p></div>`;
