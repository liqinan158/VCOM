Americans have opted for the "e"-less spelling, while <i>judgement</i> has lingered in the U.K. But even there, <i>judgment</i> has now become the conventional spelling in legal usage. Use your judg(e)ment when deciding how to spell this word, and leave out the "e" for an American audience.</p></div></div>`;
