You'd probably be <i>irritated</i> if someone ate the leftover Indian food that you were saving for lunch.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>irritated</i> describes a state that's a little milder than anger. When you're irritated about something, you're impatient or exasperated, the way you feel when someone rubs you the wrong way. <i>Irritated</i> can also mean this quite literally; your wrist might be irritated by the rubbing of your new watch band. The word <i>irritated</i> comes from the Latin <i>irritatus</i>, which means "excite or provoke." Anything that provokes you in an annoying way can make you irritated.</p></div>`;
