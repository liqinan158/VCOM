The word comes from the military but has spread out â€” police might <i>raid</i> a shady nightclub to find bad guys, or a babysitter might <i>raid</i> the refrigerator.</p><p class="long">When an army launches a raid, you can say they raid, or attack abruptly. This verb can also be used to mean "search" or "enter unexpectedly," as when police officers raid a suspect's home or summer campers' raid a neighboring cabin. The military meaning is the oldest, and the word comes from the Scottish <i>rade</i>, "a riding" or "a journey," from the Old English <i>rad</i>, which is also the root of <i>road</i>.</p></div></div>`;
