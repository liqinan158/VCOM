You've probably seen paintings of nineteenth century women wearing <i>snoods</i>.</p><p class="long">A snood covers and pulls back the hair, much like a hairnet worn by a restaurant worker. But while a hairnet is functional, meant to keep strands of hair from ending up in customers' food, a snood is ornamental, more like a hat or scarf. It's uncommon to see women wearing snoods these days, but they show up all the time in nineteenth century art. The root of <i>snood</i> is the Old English <i>snod</i>, "hair ribbon."</p></div></div>`;
