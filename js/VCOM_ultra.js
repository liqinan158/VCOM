Neither would be a good fit for your own ultra relaxed philosophy of life. <i>Ultra</i> means "beyond" in Latin, and its meaning of "outside the norm" comes from the French word <i>ultra-royaliste</i>, or "extreme royalist." Eventually, it was shortened to just <i>ultra</i>, to describe any extreme opinion.</p></div></div>`;
