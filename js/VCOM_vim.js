If you've got <i>vim</i>, then you probably pack a little extra oomph in your life!</p><p class="long"><i>Vim</i> is an odd-looking word, but it stands for a simple concept: being ready for activity, especially vigorous activity. Someone who is always playing sports or going on trips is full of vim. Someone who lies on the couch watching TV all day shows very little vim. This word often appears in the phrase "<i>vim</i> and vigor." If you have vim, you have energy and you're ready to put that energy into all sorts of activities; you're up for anything.</p></div>`;
