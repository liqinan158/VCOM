But if someone offers you a bowl of <i>cereal</i>, donâ€™t expect a pile of grass. <i>Cereal</i> is also a popular breakfast food served in a bowl with milk.</p><p class="long">You can use the word <i>cereal</i> when you talk about a grain crop, the harvested grain, or the prepared breakfast food. Oatmeal is a hot cereal, and Cheerios is a cold one. Originally, <i>cereal</i> meant "having to do with edible grain," from the Latin <i>Cerealis</i>, "of grain," but also "of Ceres, the Roman goddess of agriculture." Next time you enjoy a bowl of Fruit Loops, make sure to thank Ceres, the goddess of agriculture.</p></div></div>`;
