If your boss announces a <i>relaxation</i> of the company dress code, that means lots of happy people will be wearing jeans to work.</p><p class="long"><i>Relaxation</i> carries many shades of meaning. It can describe being free from responsibility, like a relaxation of your usual obligations that comes while you're on vacation. The feeling of rest and peacefulness that can come from this freedom is also called <i>relaxation</i>. It comes from Latin: <i>re-</i> means "again," <i>laxare</i> means "loosen," and the suffix <i>-ation</i> means "the state of." So relaxation is the state of loosening something again.</p></div></div>`;
