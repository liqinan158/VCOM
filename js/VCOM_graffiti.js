That’s the debate about graffiti.  For some people, graffiti looks ugly and damages the property where it’s left.  Others consider graffiti a form of self-expression and a celebration of public spaces.  The word comes from the Italian <i>graffito</i>, which means “a scratch,” and like a deep scratch, graffiti can be difficult to remove.   It’s also difficult to spell, but remember that there are two <i>f</i>s and only one <i>t</i> and you’ll get it right every time.</p></div>`;
