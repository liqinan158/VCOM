To be a <i>musher</i>, you need (among other things) to learn commands and dress warmly.</p><p class="long">The sport of driving a team of dogs is known as <i>mushing</i>, and a person who participates is a <i>musher</i>. Both terms come from the command "Mush!" that mushers have traditionally called to urge the sled dogs forward. In the late 1860s, this term was recorded as <i>mouche</i>, which likely comes from the French <i>marche</i>, "go" or "run." Today, even more confusingly, mushers are more likely to say "Hike!" than "Mush!"</p></div></div>`;
