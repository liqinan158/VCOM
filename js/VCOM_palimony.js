The name of this legal agreement is <i>alimony</i>, from a Latin root, <i>alimonia</i>, or "nourishment." Alimony has been around for hundreds of years, while the newer <i>palimony</i> wasn't coined until 1979. Palimony is still fairly uncommon, and the term includes the general division of money and other assets when a couple separates.</p></div></div>`;
