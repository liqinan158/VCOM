For example, in New York, Spanish Harlem is also called El <i>Barrio</i>. Outside the U.S., <i>barrio</i> refers to a district in Spain or a Spanish-speaking country.</p><p class="long">The word <i>barrio</i> means "neighborhood" in Spanish, and in most Spanish-speaking places, that's exactly what it means. In Cuba and Spain, barrios are official divisions of municipalities. But in New York, Los Angeles, Tucson, Miami, and other U.S. cities, a barrio isn’t an official district, it’s just the neighborhood where Spanish speakers settled and/or still live.</p></div></div>`;
