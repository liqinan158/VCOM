Anything that distracts you from this sentence is clearly an example of <i>irrelevance</i>.</p><p class="long">The Latin root word for <i>irrelevance</i> is <i>relevare</i>, which means “raising up.” The prefix <i>ir</i>- means “not,” therefore if a situation does not relate to or raise your interest, it’s irrelevant. In a courtroom, lawyers who lose sight of their case argue about irrelevances, and your sister speaks with irrelevance when she wakes you up to talk about rainbows. It’s always best to focus on important things, but irrelevance now and then won’t kill you.</p></div></div>`;
