We see frequent <i>fluctuations</i> in the stock market, as prices go up or down, and also in the weather, which is always changing.</p><p class="long">The original form of the word <i>fluctuation</i> appeared as a mid-15th-century French word derived from the Latin <i>fluctuationem</i>, meaning "vacillation." The verb stem <i>fluctuƒÅre</i> meant "to undulate," referring to waves, giving rise to the idea of change and movement that is at the heart of the word. It might help to remember that <i>fluctuation</i> has the same root as the word <i>fluent</i>, and to think of it as something flowing, with frequent change along the way.</p></div></div>`;
