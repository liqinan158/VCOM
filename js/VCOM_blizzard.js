We're not talking <i>flurry</i> or a <i>snowsquall</i>. It's the kind of snow storm you read about.</p><p class="long">If you had to shovel 5 inches of snow off of your sidewalk, the snow storm was probably just a snow storm, an annoyance perhaps but not a <i>blizzard</i>. A <i>blizzard</i> is a huge snowstorm that results in the disruption of normal activities. Offices close, schools are shut down, streets are snow-packed, and people stay at home. The word can also be used figuratively, to mean "a rash" of something â€” like the blizzard of insurance forms you had to complete after surgery.</p></div>`;
