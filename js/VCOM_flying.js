You can also use this word to describe anything that's soaring through the air, like a <i>flying</i> squirrel or <i>flying</i> insects.</p><p class="long">Use <i>flying</i> for anything that flaps or flutters above the ground, from flying fish to flying turkeys. It's also good for describing things that are propelled or blown into the air: "As the baseball hit the window, I ducked to avoid the flying glass." "The wind picked up and I watched the flying leaves dance around my yard." Some things only appear to fly, like a flying buttress, an architectural projection that "flies" from the side of a building.</p></div></div>`;
