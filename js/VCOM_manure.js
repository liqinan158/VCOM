The manure itself might be, for example, a combination of cow dung and straw, or slightly decomposed chicken waste. Sometimes the word <i>manure</i> is used for any kind of fertilizer, including those made entirely from plants. The earliest meaning of <i>manure</i> was "to cultivate land," from an Old French root word, <i>manouvrer</i>, "to work with the hands or cultivate."</p></div></div>`;
