Even though Juliet says to Romeo, “a <i>rose</i> by any other name would smell as sweet,” don’t go calling it a dandelion.</p><p class="long">Roses have multi-layered petals and smell wonderfully sweet. They come in a wide variety of colors that can convey various meanings: a single red rose, for example, sometimes means, "I love you." <i>Rose</i> is also the past tense of <i>rise</i>, as in “Yesterday, the water <i>rose</i> to the top.” As an adjective, <i>rose</i> means "pink," and when the word is pronounced <i>row-SAY</i>, it means a rose-colored wine. The Latin source of <i>rose</i> is <i>rosa</i>, which probably comes from an Iranian root.</p></div></div>`;
