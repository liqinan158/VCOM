Often it's used to describe a person who shows a moment of weakness or fright: he was so tough, I thought he'd never <i>flinch</i>, but snakes really freak him out.</p><p class="long">To <i>flinch</i> is to pull away suddenly or recoil when something frightens or hurts you. People flinch at different things. Needles, for example, cause some people to flinch, while they're not even noticed by others. If you can withstand something awful without showing it, you're likely to hear someone say "Wow! You didn't even <i>flinch</i>!" Think of it as a combination of <i>flee</i> and <i>pinch</i>. If you don't flee when you get pinched, you don't flinch.</p></div></div>`;
