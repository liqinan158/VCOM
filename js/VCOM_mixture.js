Sometimes, like in the case of ice cream with fudge, a <i>mixture</i> can turn out delicious. At other times, though, like with oil and water, a <i>mixture</i> just fails to jive.</p><p class="long">A <i>mixture</i> is a concoction of several parts combined. In chemistry, it describes a composition made up of two or more substances that can be separated. When it comes to textiles, <i>mixture</i> describes fabric that consists of various yarn or materials. Note the difference between <i>mix</i> and <i>mixture</i>, though. Elements in a <i>mix</i> retain their unique parts even though they have been thrown together. In a <i>mixture</i>, elements are blended in such a way that they forfeit their individuality.</p></div>`;
