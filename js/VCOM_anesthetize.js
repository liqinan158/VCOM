Oral surgeons also anesthetize patients before removing their wisdom teeth. In both cases, special drugs are used to put the patient under, or make him sleep long enough for the procedure to be finished before he wakes up. A doctor whose job it is to anesthetize patients is called an <i>anesthesiologist</i>. The root word is Greek: <i>anaisthesia</i>, "lack of feeling or sensation."</p></div></div>`;
