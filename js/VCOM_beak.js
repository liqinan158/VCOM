A <i>beak</i> is the hard, pointed structure sticking out from a bird’s face.</p><p class="long">The word <i>beak</i> refers to the bill on a bird, which protrudes from the face and is used for eating, grooming, and pecking. You can think of it sort of like the mouth of a bird, only it’s made up of hard, horny material rather than flesh. The word <i>beak</i> is sometimes used informally to refer to a person’s nose, especially if the nose is large, prominent, and protruding — in other word, sort of like a bird’s beak.</p></div></div>`;
