A scrimmage is also a practice between two squads. You can also use <i>scrimmage</i> as a verb for other types of practicing. A basketball player might scrimmage by shooting one hundred free throws, for example. Originally, <i>scrimmage</i> was a variation on the word <i>skirmish</i>, and meant "a confused struggle between players."</p></div>`;
