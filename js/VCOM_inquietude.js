If you're worried about a friend driving home in the snow, your <i>inquietude</i> won't let you relax until you hear that she's arrived safely.</p><p class="long">The feelings of unease or fretfulness that go along with inquietude might come from a fear of heights, worry about someone you love, or general anxiety. This noun comes from the Latin <i>inquietus</i>, "not quiet." Interestingly, the adjective version of this word isn't <i>inquiet</i>, which isn't a real word â€” instead it's <i>unquiet</i>, meaning "restless or anxious."</p></div>`;
