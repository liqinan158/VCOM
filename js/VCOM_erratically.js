Or, your anxiety about getting an important grade could make you behave erratically, chewing your nails nervously one minute and laughing loudly the next. Things that are <i>erratic</i> are uneven or unpredictable, and the Latin root is <i>erraticus</i>, "wandering, straying, or roving."</p></div>`;
