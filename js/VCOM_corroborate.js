If you swear to your teacher that you didn't throw the spitball, and your friends <i>corroborate</i> your story by promising that you were concentrating on math homework, she might actually believe you.</p><p class="long">For example, a witness in court corroborates the testimony of others, and further experimentation  can corroborate a scientific theory. Near synonyms are <i>substantiate</i> and <i>confirm</i>. <i>Corroborate,</i> originally meaning "to support or strengthen," was borrowed from Latin <i>corrōborāre</i>, formed from the prefix <i>cor-</i> "completely" plus <i>rōborāre</i> "to strengthen" (from <i>rōbur</i> "strength").</p></div>`;
