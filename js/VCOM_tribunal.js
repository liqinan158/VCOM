If you've done something wrong and you get caught it's likely you'll be brought before a <i>tribunal</i>, although not all <i>tribunals</i> are there to determine guilt.</p><p class="long">Say, for example, you'd like to join a secret society. That society might convene a tribunal to determine whether you're worthy of joining. One way to remember <i>tribunal</i> is to focus on the <i>tri</i> at the beginning of the word. A tribunal is there to "try" a case. A tribunal is a group of people who oversee a trial. Your mom and dad could be a tribunal. You could also think of it as the group who oversees their tribe, which is, in fact, where the word comes from.</p></div>`;
