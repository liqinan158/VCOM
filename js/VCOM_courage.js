Unlike the Cowardly Lion, who went all the way to the Emerald City to see if the Wizard had any <i>courage</i> to spare.</p><p class="long">In Middle English, <i>courage</i> referred to “what is in one’s mind or thoughts." Today, anyone with <i>courage</i> has only fearless feats and <i>courageous</i> acts in mind. Having courage means acting when others are afraid of the danger, or simply acting without fear of failure. As the American poet Robert Frost advised, “Have courage and a little willingness to venture and be defeated.”</p></div></div>`;
