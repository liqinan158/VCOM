The <i>theremin</i> is distinctive for being the only musical instrument that a player never touches.</p><p class="long">A thereminist plays by moving their hands close to, but not touching, the theremin's two oscillating antennas. These hand movements change the instrument's pitch and volume by interfering with the frequency of radio waves. The instrument is named for its inventor, Léon Thérémin, a Russian scientist and KGB spy.</p></div></div>`;
