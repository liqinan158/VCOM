You might hope that your relationship with your high school boyfriend will last into <i>infinity,</i> but, realistically, you know that's not likely to happen.</p><p class="long">You've probably come across infinity in mathematics — a number, like pi, for instance, that goes on and on, symbolized as ∞. Astronomers talk about the infinity of the universe, and religions describe God as infinity. A more earthbound example is an infinity pool — a swimming pool designed to trick the eye and look like it doesn't have an edge, so the water goes on forever. You may know the Latin phrase <i>ad infinitum,</i> which means "and on and on."</p></div>`;
