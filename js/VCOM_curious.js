A curious student asks lots of questions. A curious little monkey, like the famous Curious George from the children’s book series, may be so curious to know how a clock works that he breaks it trying to get a closer look inside. <i>Curious</i> can also describe something unusual, like a house that is painted a curious shade of purple.</p></div></div>`;
