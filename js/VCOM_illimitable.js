It's more common to say something's <i>limitless</i> or <i>measureless,</i> but <i>illimitable</i> is good if you want to sound literary or formal, say if you're talking about the "illimitable power of human endeavor."  If you use <i>illimitable</i> to describe something like your appetite for candy, it will sound kind of funny, which is perfectly fine as long as you're going for a laugh.</p></div>`;
