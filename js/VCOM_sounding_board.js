The reaction of your <i>sounding board</i> gives you an idea of how your eventual audience will react.</p><p class="long">A writer might have a good friend who acts as a sounding board, reading drafts of her novel before she submits it to a publisher. Big companies also use sounding boards, trying out new products or ideas on them to gauge how successful they might be. The original, literal <i>sounding board</i> is a device — often an actual board that vibrates — meant to help amplify a speaker's voice from a stage, podium, or pulpit.</p></div></div>`;
