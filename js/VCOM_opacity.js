A professor whose lectures are known for <i>opacity</i> is going to find himself in a room full of some very frustrated students.</p><p class="long">In its literal sense <i>opacity</i> is used to talk about objects that don't allow light to shine through. A window that has accumulated a lot of dirt and dust is characterized by its <i>opacity</i>, as opposed to a transparent window, which is one you can see right through. The word <i>opacity</i> is used more generally for anything obscure, unclear, or incomprehensible, like the opacity of a novel full of ten-syllable words or a dictionary that doesn't give you any clear or straightforward definitions.</p></div>`;
