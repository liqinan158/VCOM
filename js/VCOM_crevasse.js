var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">crevasse</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If you're heading to the North Pole by sled, watch out you don't fall into a <i>crevasse</i> â€” a deep fissure or crack in the snow or ice. Similar to the term "crevice," though "crevice" usually refers to a fissure in a rock face. Neither one is a nice place to get stuck.</p><p class="long">The word <i>crevasse,</i> as its spelling suggests, comes from an old French word, the verb <i>crevare,</i> meaning "to burst or break," and indicating how a crevasse was formed in the first place. The reason for the difference in the two terms, <i>crevasse</i> and <i>crevice,</i> was originally to indicate a difference in size: in general a crevasse is much larger than a crevice, which can often be extremely small.</p></div>`;
