Sometimes this group of musicians is called a "symphony <i>orchestra</i>," and it's directed by a conductor with a baton. The word <i>orchestra</i> comes from the actual space in which an orchestra plays; the Greek <i>orkhestra</i> means "a space where a chorus of dancers performs," from <i>orkheisthai</i>, "to dance."</p></div>`;
