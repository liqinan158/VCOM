When something is <i>abandoned</i>, it's been cast off or deserted.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>abandoned</i> describes something that's been given up or discarded. You can use it to talk about a kitten abandoned at an animal shelter, an old car abandoned by the side of the road, or a person's dreams of becoming an opera singer abandoned when they had kids. It comes from the French phrase <i>mettre a bandon</i>, "put someone under another's control."</p></div></div>`;
