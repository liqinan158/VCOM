It's common for <i>chintz</i> to be printed with big, colorful flowers.</p><p class="long">Frequently used in upholstery and other home decor, chintz is a lightly glazed, many-colored fabric. Traditionally, chintz was made from calico, a type of printed cotton, and featured a light background with bright floral patterns. This style of decorating is now known generally as <i>chintz</i>, whether it's dishes or wallpaper that feature bright flowers. The derogatory adjective <i>chintzy</i>, or "cheap," comes from the perceived low quality of chintz. The word has a Sanskrit root meaning "bright."</p></div></div>`;
