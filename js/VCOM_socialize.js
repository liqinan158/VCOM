If you have been studying alone for some time, you might take a break at the coffee shop to <i>socialize</i> with some friends.</p><p class="long">You can socialize somebody else, or educate her in social patterns. Parents socialize their kids through their upbringing, and clubs often socialize their members through a uniform.  If you want to hang out with motorcyclists, you might want to dress in leather. It is also possible to socialize institutions, where benefits are open to a wide section of society. If voters socialize medicine, that service becomes available to all at government expense.</p></div></div>`;
