Some people call such <i>desultory</i> wanderings spontaneous. Others call it "being lost."</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>desultory</i> comes from the word <i>desultor</i>, which was a circus rider who would leap from the back of one galloping horse onto another. From this literal sense of jumping from one thing to another, we get the modern meaning of <i>desultory</i> as jumping between things without a logical purpose.</p></div>`;
