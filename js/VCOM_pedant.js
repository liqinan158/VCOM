var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">pedant</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>pedant</i> is an annoying person who is focused on minor details and book knowledge rather than ordinary common sense. In war, it can be dangerous to have a pedant as commander — he'll insist on textbook maneuvers instead of adapting to circumstances on the ground.</p><p class="long">This word was borrowed from French <i>pédant</i> or Italian <i>pedante</i> "teacher, schoolmaster," but its ultimate origin is unknown. One theory is that the original meaning of Italian <i>pedante</i> was "foot soldier," associated with the Italian word <i>pedagogo</i> "teacher" because teachers are always on their feet. Another theory is that Italian <i>pedante</i> was formed from the root of Greek <i>paideuein</i> "to teach," which happens to be the source of English <i>pedagogue</i> "teacher." In fact, a <i>pedagogue</i> is a pedantic teacher.</p></div>`;
