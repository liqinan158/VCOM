It means lacking in knowledge or understandingâ€”the kind you might have if you were older or more sophisticated.</p><p class="long">Although it sounds a lot like "being knighted", <i>benighted</i> has nothing to do with knights and, in fact, includes the word "night" (as in the opposite of day) and not "knight" (as in "of the Round Table"). One way to remember what <i>benighted</i> means is to think of a person "being nighted" or, put into the dark. A benighted person is in the dark about things: they don't know because they can't see. The Dark Ages are thought to have been a benighted time, full of primitive ideas.</p></div></div>`;
