Nearly every string quartet includes at least one <i>violin</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>violin</i> comes from <i>viola</i>, from the Italian <i>viola da braccio</i>, which was a popular medieval instrument. The earliest violins had only three strings, while modern instruments have four. Starting around the 16th century, the violin became a very popular instrument, particularly among nobles. Most violins are built from maple wood, and their strings are made of dried animal gut or steel and are sometimes plated with silver.</p></div>`;
