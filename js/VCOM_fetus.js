Once upon a time, you started as an embryo, matured into a <i>fetus</i>, and were then thrust into the world as a newborn.</p><p class="long"><i>Fetus</i> is a Latin word that means "the bearing, bringing forth, or hatching of young." Even though the Latin points to a fetus "hatching," contemporary science only regards viviparous vertebrates as having fetuses. In other words, if an animal has a backbone and was delivered via live birth, it was once a fetus. If a kitten has claws, whiskers, and ears, but is still inside its mother's womb, it's a fetus. In the UK, <i>fetus</i> is spelled <i>foetus</i>.</p></div></div>`;
