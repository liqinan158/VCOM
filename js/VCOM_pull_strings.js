If your college application gets a second look because your mom knows the admissions director, you <i>pull strings</i> to increase your chances of acceptance.</p><p class="long">This idiom has been around since the 1800s. It comes from puppetry and the way a puppeteer pulls a puppet's strings to make it move and perform a certain way. When you pull strings, you use your influence to make people do things to your advantage, whether it's asking your uncle who owns a candy store to hire your best friend or leveraging your family's friendship with a theater director to get yourself a starring role in her new play.</p></div></div>`;
