These areas ruled by <i>satraps</i> were called "satrapies."</p><p class="long">The Persian emperor Cyrus the Great first chose satraps to rule individual provinces, around 530 BCE. Each satrap controlled a specific amount of land, collecting taxes and maintaining law and order. The word <i>satrap</i> continued to be used in various places, including India and East Asia, to refer to local rulers. The word comes from the Latin <i>satrapes</i>, with the Old Persian root <i>xšathrapavan</i>, "guardian of the realm," from <i>xšathra-</i>, "realm," and <i>pavan-</i>, "guardian."</p></div></div>`;
