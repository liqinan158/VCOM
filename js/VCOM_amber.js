Many cats have green eyes but those with <i>amber</i> eyes are likely to have yellow or white fur.</p><p class="long">Amber is also a translucent golden or honeyed-yellow colored gemstone, often used to make jewelry. That's where the color amber gets its name. Amber comes from the ocean floor â€” most of it is harvested from the Baltic Sea off the coast of Russia. The most likely origin of <i>amber</i> is the Latin word for "bitter," <i>amarus</i>, as the color yellow was often associated with bitterness and envy.</p></div>`;
