That means dull, flavorless, or just plain “blah.”</p><p class="long"><i>Bland</i> comes to us from the Latin word <i>blandus</i>, meaning “mild, smooth, flattering, alluring.” Funny, because today you wouldn't say there's anything "alluring" about something bland. People still use <i>bland</i> to mean pleasant and tranquil, but it more often has a negative connotation. Use it to describe plain old oatmeal before you’ve added brown sugar and berries to it, or to depict the forgettable, uninteresting personality of the lunch lady who served it to you.</p></div>`;
