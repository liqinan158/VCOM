So to <i>eschew</i> something isn’t simply to avoid it, the way you would avoid walking in a puddle––it's stronger than that. You <i>eschew</i> things that you find morally or aesthetically wrong, or that you have chosen to find wrong. A dieter might <i>eschew</i> a chocolate sundae, not because he doesn’t like it, but because he’s afraid of what it will do to his waistline.</p></div></div>`;
