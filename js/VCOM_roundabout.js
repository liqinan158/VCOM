Instead of every car stopping, they enter the <i>roundabout</i> slowly, and traffic moves almost continuously.</p><p class="long">In the UK, an amusement park ride that moves in a circle, like a carousel, is also a <i>roundabout</i>, but in North America this noun almost always means what's sometimes called a "traffic circle" or a "rotary." As an adjective, <i>roundabout</i> describes things that aren't straightforward, but are indirect or unclear: "After his <i>roundabout</i> confession, I'm not even sure he realizes what he did wrong."</p></div>`;
