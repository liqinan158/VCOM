Doing sit-ups every night and learning to speak Mandarin might be part of your new <i>self-improvement</i> routine.</p><p class="long">Anything you do in an attempt to improve yourself is self-improvement. Volunteering at a homeless shelter, going to college, learning to meditate â€” all of these things can lead to self-improvement. Often, <i>self-improvement</i> and <i>self-help</i> are used interchangeably. The <i>improvement</i> part of this word originally meant "making money with something," but by the 1640s it came to mean "the act of making better."</p></div></div>`;
