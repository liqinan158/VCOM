If you want to impress your friends, call that sculpture in the park that looks like an oval an <i>ovoid</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Ovoid</i> can also be used as an adjective that means "egg-shaped," as in the ovoid chocolates in a box of candy. <i>Ovoid</i> comes from the Latin word <i>ovum</i>, meaning "egg." The suffix <i>-oid</i> means "like." When you combine those, you can easily see how <i>ovoid</i> came to mean "egg-like." To correctly pronounce <i>ovoid</i>, accent the first syllable and give it the long <i>o</i> sound: "OH-void."</p></div>`;
