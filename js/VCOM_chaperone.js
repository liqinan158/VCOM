A <i>chaperone</i> is someone who looks after and supervises another person or a group of people.</p><p class="long"><i>Chaperone</i> can also be spelled <i>chaperon</i>, without the <i>e</i>. It originally meant a woman whose duty was to accompany a younger woman and make sure she wasn't harmed and didn't get into trouble, especially when she was with a man. These days, <i>chaperone</i> is most often used to describe an adult who supervises a group of kids or teenagers. The Old English meaning was "protective hood or head covering," and today the word <i>chaperone</i> retains that "protective" quality.</p></div>`;
