If you are <i>proactive,</i> you make things happen, instead of waiting for them to happen to you.</p><p class="long"><i>Active</i> means "doing something." The prefix <i>pro-</i> means "before." So if you are proactive, you are ready before something happens. The opposite is being reactive, or waiting for things to unfold before responding. Think about winter cold season. A proactive person washes his hands and takes vitamins; a reactive person gets sick and takes cold medicine.</p></div>`;
