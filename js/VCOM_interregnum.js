If you're a rebel leader, you may try to gain power during an <i>interregnum</i>.</p><p class="long">Pronounce <i>interregnum</i> with the accent on the third syllable: "in-ter-REG-num." It comes from Latin: <i>inter-</i> means "between" and <i>regnum</i> means "kingship, dominion, rule, realm." An interregnum can be marked by no government at all, or it can refer to a different kind of leadership between two similar regimes.</p></div></div>`;
