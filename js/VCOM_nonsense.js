The most famous <i>nonsense</i> poem is Lewis Carroll's "Jabberwocky."</p><p class="long"><i>Nonsense</i> means exactly what it sounds like: not containing a lick of sense. Nonsense words are made up. But sometimes if you say something in a really confusing way, people will say you're speaking nonsense: even though you're using normal words, you don't make any sense. Sometimes people will dismiss ideas that they don't like by calling them nonsense, but you might know better. Little household knick-knacks that have no purpose are also called nonsense.</p></div>`;
