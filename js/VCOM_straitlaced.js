Your <i>straitlaced</i> parents will be alarmed if you dye your hair purple and drop out of school to become a mime.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>straitlaced</i>, which can also be spelled <i>strait-laced</i> or <i>straightlaced</i>, is a synonym for "uptight" or "stuffy." The general idea is that straitlaced people are too rigid or narrow in their thinking, based on the old-fashioned adjective <i>strait</i>, "tight," and the fashion of lacing women's dresses extremely tightly. Phrases like "strait and narrow" and the word "straitjacket" share this "tight" root with <i>straitlaced</i>.</p></div>`;
