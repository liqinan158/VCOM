A <i>rotary</i> is also a traffic circle.</p><p class="long">Just as the Earth rotates around the sun, rotary objects move in a circle or orbit. A rotary telephone has a circular dial that turns, and a rotary mower has a cutting blade that moves in a circular motion. A type of street where traffic flows in a circle — sometimes called a <i>roundabout</i> — can also be called a rotary. The word stems from the Latin word <i>rotarius</i>, "pertaining to wheels," from its root word <i>rota</i>, or "wheel."</p></div></div>`;
