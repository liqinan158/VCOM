You might tearfully declare that after your favorite TV show ends, you'll nevermore watch television, or feel sad that you'll nevermore be a little kid playing tag without a care in the world. The most famous use of <i>nevermore</i> is in Edgar Allen Poe's poem "The Raven:" "Quoth the raven, '<i>Nevermore</i>.'"</p></div></div>`;
