When chilly breezes start to <i>blow</i>, it's time to close your windows.</p><p class="long">People blow candles out on birthday cakes and blow up balloons â€” a person blows by directing a flow of air from the mouth in a steady stream. When the wind blows, an air current moves. Another way to blow something is to burst, break, or ruin it: "If I drive over that broken glass, I'll <i>blow</i> a tire," or "I just know I'm going to <i>blow</i> my audition." You can also blow money, by wasting or squandering it.</p></div></div>`;
