They are ground-dwelling monkeys, and in the wild they form complex families and groups with higher- and lower-ranking members. If you visit a zoo with a primate area, you'll probably see baboons. The Old French word for <i>baboon</i> is <i>baboin</i>, or "ape," which might come from <i>baboue</i>, "muzzle" or "grimace."</p></div>`;
