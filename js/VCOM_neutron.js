The hydrogen atom is the only atom without a <i>neutron</i>.</p><p class="long">The basis for the word <i>neutron</i> is both "neutral" and the suffix "-on," which probably comes from the Greek <i>ión</i>, "to go." The word <i>ion</i> first appeared in English in 1834, and <i>neutron</i> appeared in 1921, to represent the neutral part of an atom. Don't let the "neutral" part fool you, though — a neutron bomb, while "smaller" than other nuclear weapons, is still capable of mass destruction, as it emits more radiation, causing a wider sweep of damage to life.</p></div></div>`;
