If you're learning a new language, you might declaim a sentence until it sounds clear and natural when you say it. <i>Declaim</i> was originally spelled <i>declame</i>, similar to the Latin word <i>declamare</i>, meaning "to practice public speaking," but later became <i>declaim</i> as its other meaning came into greater use.</p></div>`;
