It is usually used with the word "in" or "into"; "in <i>abeyance</i>" suggests a state of waiting or holding.</p><p class="long">The word <i>abeyance</i> has a legal ring to it, and for a good reason â€” appearing in English in the 16th century, it comes from the Anglo-French word <i>abeiance</i>, a legal term for waiting or hoping to receive property. Nowadays, the word is used in a similar way. Different legal rights, like property rights, can be held in abeyance until matters are resolved.</p></div></div>`;
