If you feel <i>cooped</i> up, you feel like you’re stuck in a small space, like a giant chicken in a tiny cage.</p><p class="long">A coop is where chickens get shelter from bad weather and predators. Without a hyphen, the word <i>co-op</i>, which is short for co-operative organization, turns into <i>coop</i>. That can be confusing to chickens because they don’t know if they will have meetings or a safe place to lay eggs. <i>Coop</i> comes from the Old English word <i>cype</i>, "basket" or "cask," with the Latin root <i>cupa</i>, "cask" or "tub."</p></div></div>`;
