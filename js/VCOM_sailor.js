If you want to be a <i>sailor</i>, it's good to start by learning to swim.</p><p class="long">If you work on a cargo ship or help to pilot a schooner in the summer, you can call yourself a sailor. You're also a sailor if you learn how to sail a small boat around a lake. Even though the boats that sailors work on don't necessarily have sails, that's where the word comes from — the verb <i>sail</i>. Before <i>sailor</i> was coined in the 15th century, people used <i>mariner</i> and <i>seaman</i>.</p></div></div>`;
