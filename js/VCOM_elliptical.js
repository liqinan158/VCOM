Many comets have an <i>elliptical</i> orbit around the Sun that brings them closer at some times and farther away at others.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>elliptical</i> refers to the shape of an ellipse, which is an elongated circle, stretched into an oval. This word can also be used to describe a way of speaking that cuts out extra, unnecessary language.
