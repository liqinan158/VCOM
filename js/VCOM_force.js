If you've ever walked outside in a blizzard, you've experienced the <i>force</i>, or strength, of the wind. May the <i>force</i> be with you!</p><p class="long"><i>Force</i> has other meanings as well. A powerful person can exert a force just by using particular words or body language. Written words can exert a force, or have a strong influence, on your opinion. As a verb, <i>force</i> means to make something happen using physical strength or some other powerful effort, which is what you do when you try to force a square peg into a round hole through vigorous pounding. And of course, in the Star Wars movie franchise, <i>the force</i> refers to the mystical energy contained in all living things. May that definition of this word always be with you.</p></div></div>`;
