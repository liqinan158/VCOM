The <i>intoxicating</i> smell of your mom's lasagna might make you forget momentarily that you said you'd meet a friend for pizza.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>intoxicating</i> is perfect for describing things that exhilarate or thrill you. The sound of an audience cheering for you at your accordion concert might feel intoxicating, and a ride on a roller coaster can also be wonderfully intoxicating. A more literal meaning of <i>intoxicating</i> is "making one drunk," and the word itself comes from a Latin root, "to poison."</p></div>`;
