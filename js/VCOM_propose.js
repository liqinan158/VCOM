If you <i>propose</i> to your girlfriend, you <i>propose</i> getting married, and you probably give her a ring, too.</p><p class="long">The word <i>propose</i> comes from the Old French root words <i>pro,</i> meaning "forth" and <i>poser,</i> meaning "put, place." Using <i>propose</i> to refer to an offer of marriage was first recorded in the 1700s but the verb also has other meanings. It can mean to present for consideration or criticism, like proposing a four-day school week or "to nominate someone for an elected office or official post."</p></div>`;
