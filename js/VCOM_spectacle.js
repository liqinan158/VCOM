Get on top of your desk at work in your underpants while playing the kazoo and you're making a <i>spectacle</i> of yourself.</p><p class="long">The word <i>spectacle</i> comes from the Latin <i>spectaculum</i> meaning "public show," an apt translation because a spectacle, like a public show, is something worth watching. A ballet is a spectacle, or an elaborate production worth watching. Often the word is used to describe something that has a particularly exciting visual element to it â€” like an acrobatic display or a magic trick. It's something you have to see to really appreciate.</p></div>`;
