You can <i>applaud</i> by clapping your hands at a performance, or you can <i>applaud</i> with just your mouth, as when you tell someone "I <i>applaud</i> your decision to start exercising."</p><p class="long">The verb <i>applaud</i> goes back to the Latin verb <i>applaudere,</i> "to clap," and it came into English use in the 15th century. Part of the word <i>applaud</i> is <i>laud</i>, which means "praise," and <i>laud</i> is close in spelling to <i>loud</i>. When you applaud, you give loud praise by clapping you hands together. If you really like what someone is doing and want to pat them on the back for it or show encouragement, you might just say "I <i>applaud</i> your efforts."</p></div></div>`;
