It's not uncommon for rooms to have <i>wainscoting</i> on the lower half of their walls.</p><p class="long">Before the 18th century, wainscoting frequently covered the entire surface of a wall, paneling a dining room or library from floor to ceiling. Newer houses are more likely to have wainscoting only on the bottom part of a wall, if at all. The wall-covering material itself can also be called <i>wainscoting</i> or <i>wainscot</i>. The original wainscoting was made of oak, but softer wood is more common today.</p></div></div>`;
