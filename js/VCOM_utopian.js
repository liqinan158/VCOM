A utopia is an ideal society, and a scheme or vision for producing such a society can be called <i>utopian</i>.</p><p class="long">In 1516, the English philosopher Thomas More published <i>Utopia</i>, a book about an island nation with the perfect form of government. This novel gave us the adjective <i>utopian</i>, which  can be used to describe plans for or works of fiction depicting ideal societies. <i>Dystopian</i> literature, by contrast, describes nightmarishly repressive worlds. It's ironic that More himself may have conceived of his Utopia as a <i>dystopia</i>, or at least a satire. The name of More's novel is anglicized Greek for "no place" â€” which makes a lot of sense if you think about it.</p></div>`;
