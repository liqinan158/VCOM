If you're doing research in very old newspapers, your library might have them available on <i>microfiche</i>.</p><p class="long">Microfiche is basically tiny photographs of old, fragile materials like journals, magazines, and newspapers. Before information began to be saved electronically on computers, microfiche was one way to save space in archives and libraries â€” instead of shelves full of journals, they could store drawers of thin photographic film containing an enormous amount of information.
