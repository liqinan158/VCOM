If you were a Presidential advisor and you convinced him to make a National Day of Pet Appreciation, then you <i>prevailed</i> upon him to recognize pets.</p><p class="long"><i>Prevail</i> can be used for different kinds of success. If you prevail upon someone, you have influence on them. If you prevail over someone, you win. Say you’re a big fan of a losing team. You might cheer, “Despite all odds, we will prevail!” To use <i>prevail</i>, there has to be some kind of contest or conflict. That could be internal, like when you have a pile of homework to do, but your desire to play video games prevails over your discipline.</p></div>`;
