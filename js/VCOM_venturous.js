Your <i>venturous</i> nature might make your mom call you a daredevil.</p><p class="long">Use the adjective <i>venturous</i> when you need an old fashioned way to describe a daring person. Mountain climbers and competitive skiers are venturous, and a little girl on her brand new skateboard, zipping down the driveway, is also venturous. It's more common these days to use the related, original adjective <i>adventurous</i>. Both words come from the Old French root <i>aventuros</i>, which means "chance, accidental, or fortuitous."</p></div>`;
