Most of the country's oranges and other citrus come from Florida, with California a close second. But oranges aren't the only citrus fruits. There are lemons, limes, grapefruits, just to name just a few. You can recognize a citrus fruit by its brightly colored, thick, and peelable rind. Citrus fruits are juicy and pulpy and make for a great breakfast. Not for me, though. All the acid in citrus makes my stomach upset.</p></div>`;
