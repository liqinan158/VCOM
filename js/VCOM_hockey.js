A flat puck is knocked across the ice with long, paddle-shaped sticks. Field hockey is similar, though there is less contact between players, and a ball, instead of a puck, is smacked with sticks. The origin of <i>hockey</i> is slightly unclear, although it may stem from the Middle French <i>hoquet</i>, "shepherd's staff," which resembles a hockey stick.</p></div>`;
