Boxes or other materials that are placed on one end of the conveyer belt are transported to the other end with no human effort, making them a popular choice in warehouses, manufacturing centers, and other kinds of busy factories. The earliest conveyer belts were used in coal mines in the late 1800s.</p></div></div>`;
