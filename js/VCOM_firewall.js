Another kind of <i>firewall</i> is the one a computer system uses to block potentially dangerous external networks or hackers.</p><p class="long">The original firewall was exactly what it sounds like: a wall that provides a safe barrier against fire. These firewalls are often used in large buildings (or between structures that are connected) to prevent a fire from spreading once it's started. The term was borrowed to describe something in computing that plays a similar role, limiting the access to a network, usually from the internet. Your firewall helps protect your computer against viruses and malware.</p></div>`;
