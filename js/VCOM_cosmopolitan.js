Places can also be described as cosmopolitan, meaning "diverse," or bustling with lots of people of varying nationalities. Any way you use it, <i>cosmopolitan</i> implies a sophistication, which might explain why both a well-known alcoholic cocktail and a famous women's magazine are both named after the word <i>cosmopolitan</i>.</p></div></div>`;
