A <i>gift</i> may be the present you receive on your birthday or it may be a natural <i>gift</i> or talent you possess — like your <i>gift</i> for reading lips.</p><p class="long">People give gifts to mark special occasions, like birthdays, weddings, anniversaries. and some holidays. Sometimes tourists buy gifts while on vacation and bring them home to their friends and family. Another kind of gift is a special ability: "She has such a <i>gift</i> for learning languages." The root of <i>gift</i> is probably the Old Norse <i>gipt</i> or <i>gift</i>, which means both "gift" and "good luck."</p></div></div>`;
