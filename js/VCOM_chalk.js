While <i>chalk</i> is made of shells and the skeletons of sea creatures, it's usually found above sea level in pits or quarries.</p><p class="long">Chalk is made of the element calcium carbonite, and it has agricultural uses, as well as showing up (in tiny amounts) in both toothpaste and antacids. The kind of chalk that you use for writing on a blackboard or decorating the sidewalk was originally made from calcium carbonite, but modern writing chalk is more often made of gypsum, a related form of calcium. <i>Chalk</i> comes from the Latin <i>calx</i>, "limestone," with the Greek root <i>khalix</i>, "small pebble."</p></div></div>`;
