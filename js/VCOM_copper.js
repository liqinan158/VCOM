Your grandmother might make her famous chocolate caramel sauce in a shiny <i>copper</i> pot.</p><p class="long">Before 1983, pennies were 95 percent copper. Today, they're almost entirely zinc (a less expensive metal), coated with a thin copper plating. They look the same, but the older coins are quite a bit heavier.

You can also use <i>copper</i> for things that have a similar color: "His copper curls make him stand out from the other choir members."</p></div></div>`;
