If you cut a sandwich in half, you can have one <i>moiety</i> for lunch and give the other <i>moiety</i> to a pigeon.</p><p class="long">One moiety plus one moiety equals a whole. <i>Moiety</i> is a synonym for the noun <i>half</i>; a semicircle or your better half can be referred to as a moiety. In anthropology, <i>moiety</i> is used to describe one of two distinct groups of a tribe. <i>Moiety</i> can also mean "a part" in general, as Shakespeare used it in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>: "The death of Antony / Is not a single doom; in the name lay / A moiety of the world."</p></div></div>`;
