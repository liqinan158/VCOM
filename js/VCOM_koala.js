They do resemble bears, with their round bodies and ears, thick gray fur, stubby tails, and bear-like behavior. The name <i>koala</i> comes from the Australian Aboriginal language Dharug, in which this animal is called a <i>gula</i>. Koalas are famous for eating eucalyptus leaves and being generally adorable.</p></div></div>`;
