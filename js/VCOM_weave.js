var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">weave</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Weaving</i> involves lacing strips of fabric, string, or some other material together to make something. You can <i>weave</i> wool to make a rug, or <i>weave</i> the details of a story together to make a great book.</p><p class="long">While <i>weave</i> originally only meant to make cloth by interlacing material, it later came to also mean more generally “combine into a whole.” Think of a spider and how it weaves its web, or of how some songs expertly weave in unexpected elements, like the sound of a siren or the waves crashing. You can also use <i>weave</i> to describe a swaying motion, like that of a car darting through traffic when it’s trying to move ahead.</p></div>`;
