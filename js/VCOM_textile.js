A <i>textile</i> is a cloth. You’re probably wearing a <i>textile</i> right now!</p><p class="long"><i>Textile</i> comes from the Latin word, <i>textilis</i> for "woven fabric” and that's exactly what it is. If you’re in the textile business, you’re dealing with the stuff that gets turned into clothes, flags, dishrags, or anything else made of cloth. If you knit a scarf, you create a hand-made textile — although the word is more often used in art or industry, as in textile design or textile imports.</p></div></div>`;
