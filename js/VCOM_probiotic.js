If you have indigestion, your doctor may suggest you try taking <i>probiotics</i>.</p><p class="long">Long before the term <i>probiotic</i> was coined, scientists noticed that people who traditionally ate yogurt had long, healthy lives. Nobel winner Élie Metchnikoff is credited with the idea that good microbes in the gut can push out the bad ones. These good microbes, in the form of food additives or supplements, got the name <i>probiotics</i> from the Latin <i>pro</i>, "for," and the Greek <i>biōtikos</i>, "fit for life" or "lively."</p></div>`;
