In the Catholic church, people can achieve <i>sainthood</i> after death. People like Mother Theresa that is, not just any chump.</p><p class="long">You can use this noun in the religious sense to describe the status of Catholic saints: "Mother Theresa officially achieved <i>sainthood</i> almost twenty years after her death." You can also use <i>sainthood</i> to talk about less-saintly people: "My sister pretends like she's headed for <i>sainthood</i>, but then she sticks her tongue out at me when my parents aren't looking!"</p></div></div>`;
