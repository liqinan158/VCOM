In a wolf pack, one male wolf fights the others, wins, and becomes the <i>dominant</i> wolf in the group.</p><p class="long"><i>Dominant</i> derives from the Latin <i>dominus</i> which means "lord or master." If you grew up with a Latin mass, you will recognize this as one of many words for God. If you're dominant, it means you treat others as if you're their master. You can also use <i>dominant</i> to describe something frequent or common. For example, when cell phones first came out, their dominant use was for making calls. Now cells phone do so much more, some people hardly make calls on them at all.</p></div></div>`;
