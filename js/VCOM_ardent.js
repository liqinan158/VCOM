A pop star's <i>ardent</i> admirers might go so crazy at his concert that they faint from excitement.</p><p class="long"><i>Ardent</i> is most often used to modify words like <i>supporter, fan, advocate, admirer,</i> and <i>defender</i> — but also <i>opponent</i>. Although you can either ardently support or oppose something, support is by far the more common use. The word literally means "burning" or "glowing" — it's from Latin <i>ardere</i>, "to burn." In poetic use, the word is sometimes used to mean "glowing," as Alexander Pope did in his 1718 translation of Homer's <i>Iliad</i>: "From rank to rank she darts her <i>ardent</i> eyes."</p></div>`;
