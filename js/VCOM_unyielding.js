That includes stubborn, <i>unyielding</i> personalities and stiff, <i>unyielding</i> mattresses.</p><p class="long">You know people who never change their minds, even when they're wrong? You could say they're unyielding. This word refers to people who refuse to budge and never give up. Sometimes thatâ€™s a good thing, and sometimes it's just plain annoying. Physical things can be unyielding if they're hard or impossible to stop. A hurricane or tornado is unyielding, and so is a speeding train. When you see the word <i>unyielding</i>, think "Can't or won't be stopped."</p></div></div>`;
