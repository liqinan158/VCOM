A related word is inferno which means a really big fire, the kind that you might find in Hell. Although it might be used to describe something really hot or something evil, <i>infernal</i> is usually used when someone is complaining about something they really don't like such as the infernal dog next door that keeps barking.</p></div></div>`;
