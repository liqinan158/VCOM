It’s logical that you’d use the word at a zoo, where critters and beasts hang out.</p><p class="long">This is an easy word to remember if you think about zoos. In fact, <i>zoo</i> is short for Zoological Gardens, the first of which was created by the London Zoological Society to house the society’s wild animals. <i>Zoo</i> comes from the Greek word for animal, <i>zoion</i>, plus <i>-ology</i> for “the study of” and then <i>-ical</i>, an ending that makes the word an adjective. If you’re describing something that has to do with the study of animals, <i>zoological</i> is your word.</p></div>`;
