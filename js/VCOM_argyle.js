If your grandmother visits Scotland, she might bring you back an <i>argyle</i> sweater.

Kilts frequently come in various argyle designs, and Scottish Highlanders have traditionally worn argyle socks since the 17th century. The word itself was inspired by the tartan belonging to the Campbell clan, from Argyll in the west of Scotland.</p></div>`;
