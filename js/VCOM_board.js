You can cut vegetables on a cutting <i>board</i>, post a flyer on a bulletin <i>board</i>, or cause a power outage on a circuit <i>board</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>board</i> frequently finds itself as half of a compound word where the action takes place: You stand on a surfboard, type at a keyboard, or lose on a checkerboard. You can also sit on a board, meaning a team, of directors, or board, meaning stay, at a hotel. If you want to leave your hotel, you may board, or climb onto, your hovercraft. Remember: Being stiff as a board is not the same as being bored stiff.</p></div></div>`;
