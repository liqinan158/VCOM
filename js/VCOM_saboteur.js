var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">saboteur</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>saboteur</i> is a person who makes a mess of a situation on purpose.  You might call your little brother a <i>saboteur</i> for letting the air out of your bicycle tires, but you could be a <i>saboteur</i> in return by filling his shoes with cold spaghetti.</p><p class="long"><i>Saboteur</i> is a noun that is fairly new to the English language; it was first used in the early 1900s, and it refers to a person who deliberately destroys or obstructs something.  It comes from the French word, <i>saboter</i>, which really and truly means to kick something with an old-fashioned wooden shoe.  We can only hope that one day the word <i>Nikeur</i> might enter the English language to mean a person who kicks something with a sneaker.</p></div>`;
