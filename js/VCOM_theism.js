Practicing Catholics, for example, subscribe to <i>theism</i>.</p><p class="long">If you believe that God created the universe, you believe in theism. Its opposite is atheism, which means not believing in any god or higher spiritual power. There are different types of theism, such as monotheism, which is belief in only one god, and polytheism, belief in more than one god. The root of <i>theism</i> is the Greek word <i>theos</i>, or "god." English philosopher Ralph Cudworth was the first to use the term <i>theism</i>, in the 1600s.</p></div>`;
