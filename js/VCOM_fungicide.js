If your beautiful roses are dying because mildew is attacking their leaves, you might need to spray them with a <i>fungicide</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>fungicide</i> is formed by taking <i>fungus</i>, "a mushroom" in Latin, and adding the suffix <i>-cide</i>, or "killer." So just like <i>matricide</i> means killing one's mother and <i>pesticide</i> means something that kills bugs, <i>fungicide</i> means something that kills fungi. Whether you have a fungus growing on your bathroom ceiling or your tomato plants, you probably need a fungicide to get rid of it.</p></div>`;
