Like the time you warned your dad against eating a whole box of donuts.  He got sick, right?  That was a <i>prophetic</i> warning.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>prophetic</i> traces all the way back to the Greek word <i>prophētikos</i>, meaning "predicting." You know who's really good at predicting stuff? Prophets. Usually, <i>prophetic</i> is used to describe a thing — like a warning, a feeling, or a complaint — rather than a person.</p></div></div>`;
