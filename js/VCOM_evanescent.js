var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">evanescent</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A beautiful sunset, a rainbow, a wonderful dream right before your alarm clock goes off — all of these could be described as <i>evanescent</i>, which means “fleeting” or “temporary.”</p><p class="long"><i>Evanescent</i> comes from the Latin <i>ex</i>, meaning "out of," and <i>vanescere</i>, meaning "to vanish." When pronouncing this word, emphasize the third syllable and note that the <i>c</i> is silent. You might want to practice saying <i>evanescent</i> a few times right now; if you stumble over pronunciation when you need this word the most, whatever you’re describing — be it a shooting star or a whiff of fragrant perfume — will be gone.</p></div>`;
