The <i>phonograph</i> was the first machine that could both record and play sounds.</p><p class="long">Thomas Edison invented the phonograph in 1877, and it evolved first into the gramophone and then the record player or turntable. Phonographs are distinguished by the large horns through which music is broadcast. A record revolves on the phonograph's base, and when the stylus or needle is placed on top, it vibrates and reproduces the recorded sounds. The word comes from the Greek roots <i>phono</i>, "sound," and <i>graph</i>, "instrument for recording."</p></div>`;
