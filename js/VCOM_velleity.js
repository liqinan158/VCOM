If you have a <i>velleity</i> to run a marathon, the marathon sounds like a good idea — but you probably aren't going to start training.</p><p class="long">The word <i>velleity</i> comes from the Latin word <i>velle</i>, to wish or to will. A mild impulse to do something, unaccompanied by any real motivation to follow through, can be called a <i>velleity</i>. If you dream of going on safari in Africa, but you never even look into how much it costs, that dream was just a velleity. Your dream of speaking fluent Spanish is a velleity if you never get around to opening your textbook.</p></div>`;
