You might have an <i>assignation</i> with your new girlfriend if the two of you were keeping your relationship private.</p><p class="long">Any kind of clandestine meeting can be called an <i>assignation</i>, but it most often describes a romantic tryst. Every encounter between the two main characters in Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" is an assignation, since their families don't approve of their relationship. The word <i>assignation</i> meant "appointment by authority" in the 14th century, from the Latin <i>assignationem</i>, "an assigning or allotment," with the "meeting by arrangement" meaning arising in the late 17th century.</p></div></div>`;
