You might want to take your car in for a <i>tune-up</i> before leaving on a cross-country road trip.</p><p class="long">A tune-up is typically a series of small repairs and adjustments to a car's engine â€” not so much to fix something that's broken but to help the car run more efficiently or to keep it running longer. Sometimes <i>tune-up</i> is also used in the context of sports or exercise: "The volleyball team had one last tune-up before the big match." <i>Tune-up</i> comes from the "musical adjustment" meaning of <i>tune</i>.</p></div>`;
