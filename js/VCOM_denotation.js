Although Paris might make you think of romance, its <i>denotation</i> is simply "the city of an old tribe called the Parisii."</p><p class="long">The Latin word <i>denotare</i> means "to mark," and <i>denotation</i> originally meant "the act of marking or the expression of something through a sign." Now we tend to use <i>denotation</i> in opposition to <i>connotation</i>, which is indirect or symbolic meaning. The denotation of <i>rose</i> is a particular kind of flower, while the connotation is of romantic love; the denotation of <i>river</i> is a body of water, while its connotation might be the unending flow of time.</p></div></div>`;
