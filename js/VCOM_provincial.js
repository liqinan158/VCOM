Someone from a small province outside of Provence, France, might seem a little more <i>provincial</i> and less worldly than someone from, say, Paris.</p><p class="long">Something or someone provincial belongs to a province, or region outside of the city. <i>Provincial</i> has a straightforward meaning when describing where someone is from, but it has some other shades of meaning too. Something provincial can be quaint and in a pleasing rural or country style, but it also can imply someone less sophisticated, as in someone with provincial, or simple, tastes. Individuals or groups of people who are considered narrow-minded are often labeled provincial, even if they're from the city.</p></div>`;
