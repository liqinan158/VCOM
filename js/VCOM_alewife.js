There are different names for alewives in different locations, including <i>gaspereau</i> in Atlantic Canada and <i>kiack</i> in Nova Scotia. In the 14th century, an <i>alewife</i> was a tavern or bar keeper's wife: the fish got the name in the 1600s, as a kind of bad joke, from the shape of its rounded abdomen.</p></div></div>`;
