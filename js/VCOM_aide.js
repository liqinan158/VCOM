It refers to a person who helps or acts as an assistant, such as a nurse's aide or a presidential aide.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>aide</i> is actually a shortened form of the 17th century French phrase, <i>aide-de-camp</i>, which meant "camp assistant" and was the title given to the secretary of a high-ranking military officer. It was used extensively throughout the Revolutionary War, and the shortened form is considered an Americanism. Today, we apply the word <i>aide</i> to anyone who serves as an advisor or as an assistant.</p></div></div>`;
