A group of kindergartners can often be found chatting <i>garrulously</i> to each other.</p><p class="long">When a politician responds garrulously to an interview question, it can be hard for her audience to find the actual answer among the chatter. But someone speaking garrulously can also be friendly and welcoming, like when you're new to group and feeling a little shy. The adverb <i>garrulously</i> and its related adjective <i>garrulous</i> both come from the Latin root <i>garrulus</i>, "talkative," with its origin in <i>garrire</i>, "to chatter."</p></div>`;
