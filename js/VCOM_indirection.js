Spies are often forced to use <i>indirection</i> to keep their identities hidden.</p><p class="long"><i>Indirection</i> involves tricking people by making them pay attention to the wrong things. For example, magicians use indirection to distract their audiences during performances, and a politician uses indirection when he gets voters upset about one issue so they'll forget about another. In Latin, <i>directus</i> means "straight," and in <i>indirection</i>, it's combined with <i>in</i>, or "not." When you practice indirection, in other words, you're not being straight.</p></div></div>`;
