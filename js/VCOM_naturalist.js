He just might grow up to be a <i>naturalist</i>, or a scientist who specializes in studying nature.</p><p class="long">A biologist whose interest lies primarily in the study of plants or animals can be called a <i>naturalist</i>, although these days it's more likely she'll be called a natural historian, a botanist, or a zoologist. The noun <i>naturalist</i> comes from the Latin word <i>natura</i>, "course of things, natural character, the universe," or literally, "birth." Be careful not to confuse <i>naturalist</i> with <i>naturist</i>, which is another word for a person who prefers to be naked â€” a nudist.</p></div></div>`;
