When something is tactical, it is artfully arranged, or planned. This most often refers to military or naval operations, but it doesn't have to.  When someone does something with a goal that is beyond the immediate result of his action, that can be seen as a tactical move. For example, renovating your kitchen might be a tactical move if you're planning to eventually sell your house and want to increase its property value.</p></div>`;
