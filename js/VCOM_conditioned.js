Many people become <i>conditioned</i> to eat something sweet after dinner.</p><p class="long">Most adults, through the habit of brushing their teeth every morning and night for their whole lives, become conditioned to brush regularly. In other words, they've been taught or trained to do it. Another way to be <i>conditioned</i> is to be in great physical shape: "I've never felt so <i>conditioned</i> as when I took that tap dancing class!" The adjective <i>conditioned</i> comes from the Old French <i>condicion</i>, "stipulation, state, or behavior."</p></div>`;
