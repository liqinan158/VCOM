Most towns have a spooky old woman with a lot of cats who all the neighborhood kids suspect of being a <i>witch</i>.</p><p class="long">The classic picture of a witch is a woman dressed in black with a tall, pointy hat, a broom, and an ugly face — this kind of witch is a popular Halloween costume. Another kind of witch is a serious believer in the religion called Wicca.
