The Greek <i>theoria</i>, "contemplation or viewing," is at the root of both words, from a root meaning "to see." In the social sciences, a theoretician might analyze society through the lens of economics, and in chess, a theoretician studies and writes about the theory and strategy of the game.</p></div></div>`;
