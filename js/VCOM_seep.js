When you see the word, imagine water coming in through your sneakers on a rainy day. It's not a lot of water, but your feet still get pretty wet.</p><p class="long">The word <i>seep</i> is related to the Dutch word for ooze. Oil seeps from the earth and blood seeps from a wound. <i>Seep</i> falls somewhere between gush and drip on a scale of how liquid flows and suggests a liquid that is thick, and unwanted. In the figurative sense, some things that seep, like bad thoughts that seep into your mind, are also unwanted. But sometimes you wish that the flow would increase like when financial aid only seeps into a disaster zone.</p></div>`;
