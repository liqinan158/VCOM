Think of the words <i>dashing</i>, <i>jaunty</i> and <i>spiffy</i> when you think of <i>dapper</i> as these are all near synonyms. All of these words are used specifically to describe men. Although there doesn't seem to be a parallel term for a well-dressed woman, if you call her <i>chic</i> or <i>stylish</i>, she will be pleased.</p></div>`;
