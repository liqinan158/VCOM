Santa Claus, with his constant "ho-ho-hoing" is a <i>jovial</i> figure.</p><p class="long"><i>Jocose</i> and <i>jocular</i> are similar words, but they refer more to things that actually cause laughter. <i>Jovial</i> is from Middle French, from Late Latin <i>jovialis</i> "relating to Jupiter, the ancient Roman god of the sky," from <i>Jupiter</i> "Jupiter" plus the Latin prefix <i>-alis</i> "relating to." In astrology, people born under the sign of Jupiter are joyful.</p></div></div>`;
