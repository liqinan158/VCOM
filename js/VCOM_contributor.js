Writers and people who donate money in particular are called <i>contributors</i>.</p><p class="long">Writers whose work is included in a book, magazine, or newspaper are called contributors. Some have specific titles like "<i>contributing</i> editor" or "<i>contributing</i> writer." If you give money for a cause or a company, that contribution also makes you a contributor. This word is used mainly for writing and donating, but it can be used in other cases for people who help with something. The surest way not to be called a contributor is to do nothing: contributors have to contribute.</p></div>`;
