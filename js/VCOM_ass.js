var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">ass</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Literally, your <i>ass</i> is your buttocks. In slang, an <i>ass</i> is a jerk or an idiot. Neither is highly regarded.</p><p class="long">When people are being slangy or folksy, you hear this word a lot: "Get off your ass!" "Watch your ass!" "Why are you such an ass?" "Get your ass in here." Though this isn't one of the very worst swear words, it is considered harsher than <i>butt</i> and lots of people consider <i>ass</i> to be an inappropriate word. You would be a lot better off using softer words like <i>bottom</i> or <i>tush</i> in most situations. Sometimes <i>ass</i> can also mean <i>sex</i> â€” another use worth avoiding.</p></div>`;
