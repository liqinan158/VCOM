If a <i>klutz</i> is carrying a tray of full glasses across a dining room, you can be sure they'll end up on the floor.</p><p class="long">This informal word is perfect for talking about a goofy oaf who trips over his own feet and seems to drop anything he's holding. You might say, "Don't let my brother move your TV â€” he's such a <i>klutz</i>!" <i>Klutz</i> is the Americanized version of the Yiddish <i>klots</i>, which means "block or lump," and also "clumsy person or blockhead." A related word in German is <i>klotz</i>, "boor, clod, or wooden block."</p></div></div>`;
