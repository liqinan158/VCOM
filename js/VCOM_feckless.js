They don’t contain a word <i>feck</i>, only the negative counterpart <i>feckless</i>. The “feck” in <i>feckless</i> began as a short form of <i>effect</i> used in the Scots dialect. So <i>feckless</i> essentially means "ineffective," but is also used to describe someone who is irresponsible, incompetent, inept, or without purpose in life.</p></div></div>`;
