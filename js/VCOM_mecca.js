The huge outlet mall near your hometown is a <i>mecca</i> for shoppers and bargain hunters.</p><p class="long">When it's capitalized, <i>Mecca</i> is the holiest city for Muslims, the place where Muhammad was born. Observant Muslims believe it's important to make a pilgrimage to Mecca at some point in their lives. Because this city near the Red Sea draws so many visitors every year, the word <i>mecca</i> gradually came to mean "place where people really want to go." So you might describe Las Vegas as a mecca for gamblers and Cirque du Soleil fans. The original Arabic word is <i>Makkah</i>.</p></div>`;
