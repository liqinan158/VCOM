People who have <i>hiccups</i> usually make a "hic" sound.</p><p class="long">Hiccups are a kind of spasm that can be brief or linger frustratingly. One man famously suffered from hiccups for 68 years — for that whole time, not a single folk remedy (doing a headstand, drinking water fast, being scared by someone, and so on) worked to relieve them. The word <i>hiccup</i> is imitative of the sound of hiccups. An Old English word for it was <i>ælfsogoða</i>, "elf heartburn," since hiccups were thought to be caused by elves.</p></div></div>`;
