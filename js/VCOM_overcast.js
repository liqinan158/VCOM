An <i>overcast</i> day can be dark, cold, and gloomy, or just quiet and calm.</p><p class="long">A day that's gray and cloudy is overcast, and a dull, sunless sky can also be described this way. A less common way to use <i>overcast</i> is when you talk about sewing — an overcast stitch catches the edge of the fabric to keep it from fraying — and the stitch itself is sometimes called an <i>overcast</i>. Before the weather-related adjective was coined, <i>overcast</i> was a verb meaning "to cover" or "to overthrow."</p></div></div>`;
