When you and your family move into a new house, you are taking <i>occupancy</i> of that home.</p><p class="long">You're probably most familiar with the word <i>occupancy</i> from signs in auditoriums and concert halls that state the room's "maximum <i>occupancy</i>." A maximum <i>occupancy</i> of 100 means only 100 people can safely fit inside that room at one time. A single-<i>occupancy</i> hotel room is meant for one person. The opposite of occupancy is <i>vacancy</i>––when no one is in possession. Hotels let you know when they have a vacancy by flashing a sign.</p></div></div>`;
