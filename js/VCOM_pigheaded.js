It's almost impossible to get a <i>pigheaded</i> person to listen to your advice.</p><p class="long">If your brother refuses to wear a winter coat on a freezing winter day, obstinately sticking to this decision even after he steps outside and starts shivering, he's pigheaded. While the original meaning of this adjective was, briefly, "having a head resembling a pig's," it's long been used to mean "stupidly stubborn." This figurative meaning comes from the reputation of pigs as being stubbornly willful.</p></div>`;
