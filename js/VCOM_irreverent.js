You might have a more light-hearted approach, poking fun of the way other people seem to almost blindly show their devotion. For example, when people at the Louvre are standing in hushed awe in front of the "Mona Lisa" it would be <i>irreverent</i> to holler "What's so great about that?"</p></div></div>`;
