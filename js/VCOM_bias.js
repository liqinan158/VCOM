But most often, <i>bias</i> is used to describe unfair prejudices: "The authorities investigated a case involving <i>bias</i> against Latinos." It is also a verb meaning "to show prejudice for or against," as in "They claimed the tests were <i>biased</i> against women." (In British English, it takes an extra S in the forms <i>biassed</i> and <i>biassing</i>.) The word goes back at least to Old Proven√ßal, a former language of southern France, in association with the sport of lawn bowling, where it referred to the tendency of a ball to roll in one direction or the other.</p></div></div>`;
