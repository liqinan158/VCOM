When <i>wind</i> rhymes with "kind," it means to turn, as in <i>winding</i> one's watch.</p><p class="long">There are all kinds of ways to wind: You can wind a ball of yarn, wind up to take a swing, or wind your way home. There are all types of wind, too, from a light breeze (top wind speed of 7 mph) to a hurricane-force wind (wind speed greater than 73 mph). A wind instrument is one where the music is made by blowing into or over a mouthpiece.</p></div>`;
