After the tickets are sold, a drawing determines which ticket holds the winning number. People <i>raffle</i> off everything from fruit baskets to cars.</p><p class="long">You might enter a raffle at a school gathering, a fair, or another event. The proceeds from selling raffle tickets often go toward a good cause, like a charity. When a group holds a raffle, you can also say that they <i>raffle</i> the prizes off â€” your French club might raffle off a bicycle to raise money for your trip to Montreal, for example. A <i>raffle</i> was originally "a dice game."</p></div>`;
