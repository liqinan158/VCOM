You might use <i>multimedia</i> to give a presentation at school.</p><p class="long">Multimedia might include video, audio clips, and still photographs, for example. A newspaper's online presence could use multimedia as well, combining graphics, sound, and animation. The word itself, sometimes spelled with a hyphen as <i>multi-media</i>, has been used since 1962, from <i>multi-</i>, or "many," rooted in the Latin <i>multus</i>, "many or much;" and media, the plural form of <i>medium</i>, or "system of communication."</p></div></div>`;
