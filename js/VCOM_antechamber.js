If you visit a friend who lives in a mansion, her butler may ask you to wait in the <i>antechamber</i> while he summons her.</p><p class="long">You're most likely to come across an antechamber in a very grand building or home â€” in most houses, a similar room would probably be called a "foyer" or a "hall." Sometimes the area where you wait before entering a museum or office is called an <i>antechamber</i>, but it's more often just a "waiting room." Palaces and crypts and pyramids often have antechambers. The word comes from the French <i>antichambre</i>.</p></div></div>`;
