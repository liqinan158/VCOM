Then you know how to <i>commend</i> someone â€” in other words, to express approval aloud.</p><p class="long">The most common meaning of <i>commend</i> is "to compliment." You commend someone when you tell them "Well done!" You can even say "I commend you on your hard work." Back in the days of Charles Dickens, <i>commend</i> often meant to put (someone or something) in the hands of someone else for safekeeping. Case in point: David Copperfield was out of luck when his cruel stepdad commended him to the equally cruel schoolmaster Mr. Creakle at Salem house.</p></div></div>`;
