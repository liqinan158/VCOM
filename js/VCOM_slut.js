It is not cool to call any woman a <i>slut</i>.</p><p class="long">This is a sexist word that should be used with caution or not used at all. Calling women <i>sluts</i> is a way of shaming them about their sex lives, and that's really no one else's business. Unfortunately, there are a lot similar words to <i>slut</i>, such as <i>adulteress</i>, <i>hussy</i>, <i>whore</i>, <i>loose woman</i>, <i>strumpet</i>, and <i>trollop</i>. The word is sometimes used for men, as in <i>man-slut</i>, which may be a sign that our ideas of sluttiness are changing.</p></div>`;
