You might have <i>gauzy</i> curtains that allow light to shine through them as they blow in the breeze.</p><p class="long">Use the adjective <i>gauzy</i> to describe something light and translucent. A girl's curtain of long hair and her summery cotton dress might both be gauzy. The word comes from <i>gauze</i>, which is a light, filmy fabric made of a thin, sheer material. The French root is <i>gaze</i>, which in turn comes either from the Arabic <i>gazz</i>, "raw silk," or possibly from the city of <i>Gaza</i>, where this type of fabric is made.</p></div></div>`;
