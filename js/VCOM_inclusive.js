An exclusive club might let you in, but an <i>inclusive</i> one will ask you to join, no strings attached.</p><p class="long"><i>Inclusive</i> is an adjective with several meanings: It can be used to describe something that's broad or extensive, such as thorough, inclusive research project. Or it describes a group that's particularly welcoming to all kinds of people. And an inclusive range is one where the limits are included along with what lies in between: a survey of “20-40 year-olds, inclusive” tells us 20 and 40 year-olds were counted, too.</p></div>`;
