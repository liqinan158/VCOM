Your poetic sensibility might allow you to choose exactly the right word to create a particular tone when you’re writing. <i>Sensibility</i> can also refer to your sensitivity to good or bad impressions — it’s sort of like your feelings. Used in this way, the word is often plural. Your brother’s thoughtless remarks may offend your sensibilities.</p></div></div>`;
