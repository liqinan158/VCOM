A <i>wrinkle</i> is a dent or line where that smoothness is interrupted.</p><p class="long">You might fret about a wrinkle in your skirt or a new wrinkle on your face. Another kind of wrinkle is more figurative: a small complication or problem that arises suddenly. You could describe a torrential rain storm as a wrinkle in your plan to film a sunny scene in your movie, for example. The Old English root is <i>gewrinclod</i>, "wrinkled, crooked, or winding," and it comes from the verb <i>wrinclian</i>, "to wind."</p></div></div>`;
