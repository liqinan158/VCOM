var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">irresolute</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Irresolute</i> describes someone who feels stuck. A decision must be made, a plan acted on, but the <i>irresolute</i> person just doesn't know what to do.</p><p class="long"><i>Resolute</i> describes certainty. When someone is resolute, things get done: plans are made and carried out. But add the prefix <i>ir</i> to <i>resolute</i> and you get its opposite. An irresolute person isn't necessarily a slacker — he or she just doesn't know what to do. Maybe it's confusion. Maybe it's a matter of waiting for better information to come along. Either way, if someone is irresolute, you'll need to be patient — or willing to nudge him or her into action.</p></div></div>`;
