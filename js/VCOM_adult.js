A full-grown person is called an <i>adult</i>: they can vote, rent cars, and choose to eat sugary cereal for dinner every night.</p><p class="long">If you're still a child, then you are not an adult — that's the noun version. Childish people don't behave in an adult manner — that's the adjective. A child might be scared by the Wicked Witch of the West, but an adult knows she's not real. Learning the difference between real life and make-believe is one of the upsides of becoming an adult.</p></div>`;
