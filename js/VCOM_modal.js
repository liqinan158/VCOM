A modal verb is a helper that gives additional information about the verb that follows it, and includes such words as "can," "will," "should," and "may," among others.</p><p class="long">The English word <i>modal</i> has long been used as a term in logic and statistics, such as "modal values." Toward the end of that century, the term was used in music, suggesting a use of harmonies and melodies based on other than the standard major and minor scales, in a style found in medieval liturgical music. Modal logic, in philosophy, is a supposition or conclusion based on the ideas of probability and necessity rather than concrete fact.</p></div>`;
