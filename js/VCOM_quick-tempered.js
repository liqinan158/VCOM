If you find yourself yelling at people several times a day, you may be <i>quick-tempered</i> â€” and you may want to take up meditation.</p><p class="long">Quick-tempered people are irritable and a little bit unpredictable. You could also describe them as "short-tempered" or "hot-tempered." Some people can laugh off things that irritate or aggravate them, or think them over thoughtfully, or just ignore them. Everyone else is quick-tempered. This adjective uses the noun sense of <i>temper</i>, which can mean both "state of mind" and specifically "angry state of mind."</p></div>`;
