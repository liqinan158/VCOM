An allergic reaction, too much exercise, or just being stressed out can bring on an asthma attack. When someone has an asthma attack, it's very hard for them to get a good breath of air. Fortunately, asthma is not usually a life-threatening disease, and people who are asthmatic are fine most of the time.</p></div></div>`;
