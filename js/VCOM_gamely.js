If you study vocabulary <i>gamely</i> (and we know you always do), you make it a point to have a great time learning new words.</p><p class="long">When you're game for something, you're excited and ready to do it. Likewise, to act gamely is to have a positive, upbeat approach to something. If you gamely agree to help your friend cram for a test, you might show up with snacks and good music â€” just to make things a little more fun. When you behave gamely, you're bringing good vibes. A coach who runs practice in a gamely manner is likely to inspire confidence in the team.</p></div>`;
