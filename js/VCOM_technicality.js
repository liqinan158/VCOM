You might consider your scuffed, unpolished shoes to be an unimportant <i>technicality</i> when you're dressing for a job interview.</p><p class="long">You can use the noun <i>technicality</i> for any small point or detail, but it's most likely to come up in the context of a court trial or a conversation with an attorney. A legal technicality is a small but ultimately important detail of the law. For example, a robbery suspect might have his trial dismissed on a legal technicality if the arresting police officer neglected to show him a search warrant before searching his house.</p></div></div>`;
