You can also use this verb to mean "be present in," so you might say that vampires populate your favorite books, or that animated characters populate most of the movies you watch. <i>Populate</i> also means "fill in" in computing: "Will you populate that spreadsheet with data?" The Latin <i>populus</i>, or "people," is at the root of <i>populate</i>.</p></div></div>`;
