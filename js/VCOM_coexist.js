If you, your roommate, and a cat all live in an apartment together, you can say the three of you <i>coexist</i>.</p><p class="long">You can use the verb <i>coexist</i> to simply mean "exist together," or it can mean something more specific â€” to live peacefully or tolerantly in the same place. Two countries might have to work to find a way to coexist despite years of conflict, for example. The word has been around since the 1600's, but it wasn't used in this second, diplomatic way until 1931. <i>Coexist</i> combines <i>exist</i>, "be" or "live," with the prefix <i>co</i>, "together."</p></div>`;
