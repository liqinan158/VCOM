It comes from the Greek word <i>tessera</i>, "a cube or square of stone or wood." Later, it came to mean "made of small square stones or tiles," or mosaics. <i>Tessellated</i> can also refer to an interlocking pattern, such as one made by paving stones on a walkway: "The <i>tessellated</i> pavement in front of the church was over 150 years old."</p></div>`;
