You could <i>isolate</i> yourself  from people by living in a remote hut or, if you're a biologist, you could <i>isolate</i> a chromosome.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>isolate</i> comes from the adjective <i>isolated</i>, which comes from the Latin <i>insulatas</i>, meaning “made into an island.” You may have heard the John Donne quote, “No man is an island.” Donne was claiming that no matter how much you might try to isolate yourself from the rest of humanity, in the end people are all connected to one another. Humanity’s need for connectedness may, in fact, be illustrated by the fact that jailers frequently isolate criminals as punishment.</p></div>`;
