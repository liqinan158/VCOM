If you felt sick but were determined to make it to your bowling tournament anyway, you might say, "I'll be there with my bowling shoes on, <i>irregardless</i> of how much I'm sneezing and coughing."</p><p class="long">Although <i>irregardless</i> often gets used to mean "regardless," it's considered highly informal, if not flat-out wrong. <i>Irregardless</i> probably grew out of a combination of the words <i>regardless</i> and <i>irrespective</i>, and it's been used ever since the 18th century as a humorous or over-emphasized version of <i>regardless</i>. If you want to be taken seriously, though, leave off the <i>ir-</i> at the beginning.</p></div>`;
