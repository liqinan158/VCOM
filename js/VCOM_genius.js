A <i>genius</i> is someone who possesses this brilliance, like a child prodigy who learned the piano at age 3 and played sold-out concerts by age 5.</p><p class="long"><i>Genius</i> comes from the Latin word of the same name, meaning "guardian deity or spirit which watches over each person from birth" or "innate ability."  Your genius — your superior talent — at the game of chess could make you a world champion. Your amazing genius would also make you a genius. The word can be used more lightheartedly to describe a natural ability or flair for something. You may have a genius for putting together stylish outfits.</p></div>`;
