Often, the secretary of an organization or club is the person who gets stuck taking the <i>minutes</i>.</p><p class="long">The best minutes provide a summary of the most important items that were discussed during a meeting. Parent-teacher organizations, city councils, and court hearings all include someone who takes minutes. In the case of a hearing, every single word spoken in the courtroom, unless specifically excluded by the judge, is included in the minutes. The Latin root of <i>minutes</i> is <i>minuta scriptura</i>, "rough notes," or "small writing."</p></div></div>`;
