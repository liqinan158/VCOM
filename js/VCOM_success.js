For others, it means getting straight As, starring in the school play, and winning the class election. <i>Success</i> means achieving a goal, and everyone's goals are different.</p><p class="long">We tend to think of success as a triumph or victory, but if you look at its linguistic roots in Latin, <i>success</i> literally just means "result." At some point several centuries ago people probably began using <i>success</i> as shorthand for "good success," and eventually they dropped the <i>good</i> altogether.  That would explain why in formal settings you still occasionally hear the phrase "good success," even though we now think of all successes as good.</p></div>`;
