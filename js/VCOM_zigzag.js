A line drawn in a <i>zigzag</i> shape makes a lot of short, sharp turns. The letter Z is a <i>zigzag</i> itself, and a thunderbolt is also often represented as a <i>zigzag</i>.</p><p class="long">The first turn a <i>zigzag</i> line makes is called a <i>zig</i>, and the second is called the <i>zag</i>. <i>Zigzag</i> can also be a verb. If you're describing how you got lost in the desert, you might say, "I meant to go straight, but then I <i>zigged</i>, and then I <i>zagged</i>." <i>Serpentine</i> describes a line that curves, but the curves are rounded (like a serpent), not short and sharp like a zigzag.</p></div></div>`;
