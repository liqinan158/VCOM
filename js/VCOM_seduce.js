A gorgeous day could <i>seduce</i> you from doing your homework.</p><p class="long"><i>Seduce</i> means something close to <i>attract</i>, <i>beguile</i>, <i>tempt</i>, and <i>mislead</i>. The word often has romantic overtones, but it doesn't have to: a clever criminal could seduce someone into a life of crime. When you're being seduced, it implies you're being tricked a little bit, often into something that's enticing but not so good.</p></div>`;
