When pronouncing this word, the main accent is on the first syllable, and the secondary accent is on the third syllable. <i>Ignominy</i> is from Latin the <i>ignominia,</i> formed from the prefix <i>in-</i>, "no, not," plus <i>nomen</i>, "name." The implication is that if someone has suffered ignominy, they have lost their good name or reputation.</p></div>`;
