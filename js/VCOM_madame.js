It’s officially for married women, like <i>Mrs.</i> in English, but it’s often used for any exotic woman, married and French or not.</p><p class="long">The title <i>madame</i> is sometimes used interchangeably with <i>madam</i> or <i>ma'am</i>, although usually the first one is intended for French-speakers. In Gustave Flaubert's novel <i>Madame Bovary</i>, the main character, Emma Bovary, is a married woman. <i>Madame</i> was originally used only to refer to or address women of high rank or royalty. In French, <i>madame</i> literally means "my lady."</p></div>`;
