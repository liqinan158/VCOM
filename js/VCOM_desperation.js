If you learned that your friend had sold her beloved shoe collection, you'd know she did it out of <i>desperation</i>.</p><p class="long">When you've lost hope or have run out of possible solutions to a problem, you're experiencing desperation. The word implies a reckless kind of frustration. For example, a person who hasn't eaten in three days might steal food out of desperation. The origin of the word traces back to the Latin <i>desperare</i>, "to lose all hope," which is formed from the prefix <i>de-</i>, "without," added to <i>sperare</i>, "hope."</p></div></div>`;
