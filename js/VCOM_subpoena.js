If you receive a <i>subpoena</i>, it doesn't mean you've done anything wrong; it just means you may have information that's needed by the court.</p><p class="long"><i>Subpoena</i> can also be a verb: You can subpoena someone by giving them a subpoena. If you receive a subpoena but fail to carry out its instructions, you're in big trouble. This fact is suggested by the Latin roots of this word: the prefix <i>sub-</i> means "under" and <i>poena</i> means "penalty." One nice thing about a subpoena is that it's not a summons; if you get one of those, it means you're being sued.</p></div></div>`;
