Haunted houses, for example, give many people the <i>heebie-jeebies</i>, while others get the <i>heebie-jeebies</i> from circus clowns.</p><p class="long">If something gives you the heebie-jeebies, it makes you very nervous. The word is especially useful when something — or someone — gives you the creeps, but you can't put your finger on exactly what it is that makes you jittery. <i>Heebie-jeebies</i> first appeared in print in the US, originally in a 1923 "Barney Google" cartoon by Billy DeBeck, who is also credited with inventing the word <i>horsefeathers</i>.</p></div>`;
