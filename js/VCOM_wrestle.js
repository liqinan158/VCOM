You might want to consider the ping pong team instead.</p><p class="long">Athletes wrestle wearing uniforms and helmets, and they follow very specific rules. Others wrestle more spontaneously — a bar bouncer might have to wrestle with an unruly patron, or a parent might need to wrestle a squirming toddler into her car seat. Yet another way to wrestle is with an idea or a problem, a kind of mental struggle. The Old English root, <i>wræstan</i>, means "to wrest," or to yank something out of another person's grasp.</p></div>`;
