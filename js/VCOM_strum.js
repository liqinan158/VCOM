It's pretty easy to <i>strum</i> a ukulele, but it sounds better if you know some chords.</p><p class="long">You might tell the guitar player in your band, "<i>Strum</i> a few chords of that song we wrote yesterday." You can also strum idly on your sister's banjo without playing actual chords, just by running your thumb down the strings. <i>Strum</i> is a noun, too, meaning "the sound or act of strumming." This word dates from the 18th century, and experts think it's imitative, sounding a bit like an actual strum.</p></div></div>`;
