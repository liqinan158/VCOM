We can't move forward â€” we can only reverse and go back in the direction from which we came."</p><p class="long">If you investigate <i>impasse</i> a little more closely, you'll discover <i>passer</i>, the French word for <i>to pass</i>. The <i>im-</i> prefix is a negative, meaning that there's no way any passing is going to occur. It's <i>im</i>possible. An <i>impasse</i> is any situation in which the parties involved can't, or won't, move forward or make any sort of progress. Either they are literally stuck, like two big trucks trying to pass each other on a narrow road, or they are figuratively stuck, as in two politicians who are unable to reach an agreement on a new policy.</p></div>`;
