You can immobilize a battery-operated toy by taking the battery out.</p><p class="long">You could immobilize your brother's car by letting the air out of his tires, or immobilize your little sister by making her so scared of an imaginary monster in the bathroom that she can't move a muscle. In both examples, someone or something is prevented from moving. To <i>immobilize</i> is to make <i>immobile</i>, or motionless, from the Latin root <i>immobilis</i>, which means both "immovable," and also "hard-hearted."</p></div></div>`;
