Many students need to get part-time jobs to pay their college <i>tuition</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>tuition</i> comes from the Anglo-French word <i>tuycioun,</i> meaning "protection, care, custody." Some people say college protects you from the "real world," at least while you are in school, but tuition is a reality all students face. <i>Tuition</i> can describe any payment made for instruction, however, even for a knitting class. That tuition can probably be covered without student loans or scholarships, though.</p></div></div>`;
