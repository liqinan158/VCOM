If you order pizza and see the delivery driver pull up in front of your house two minutes later, you'll be amazed at the <i>immediacy</i> of your pizza's arrival.</p><p class="long">Something that's immediate, or instantaneous, has the quality of <i>immediacy</i>. Another way to use this noun is to mean "directly," or "firsthand." For example, when people first viewed live news reports on television, they probably marveled at the immediacy of watching something as it was happening, directly and without delay. <i>Immediacy</i> has been in use since about 1600, and it comes from the adjective <i>immediate</i>, with its Latin root of <i>immediatus</i>, "without anything in between."</p></div></div>`;
