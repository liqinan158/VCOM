var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">crushing</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Something that's <i>crushing</i> is terribly upsetting or overwhelming. Your favorite team's <i>crushing</i> loss to its rival comes as a huge, disappointing surprise.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>crushing</i> can be used to describe physical devastation, like a boxer's crushing blow to his opponent's face, but it more often describes a humiliating or dismaying situation. Bad news might be a crushing blow, and being turned down for a date to the prom could feel like a crushing rejection. <i>Crushing</i> comes from the Old French <i>cruissir</i>, a variation on <i>croissir</i>, "to gnash, crash, or break."</p></div>`;
