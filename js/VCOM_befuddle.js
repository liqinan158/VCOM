A sticky exam question can <i>befuddle</i> you, or an awkward question about your whereabouts the night before (how can you remember? You were <i>befuddled,</i> after all.)</p><p class="long">In sixteenth century Britain a popular thing to do (about the only thing to do) after the hogs had been fed and the chickens put away for the night was <i>fuddle</i> â€” in other words get pretty drunk. <i>Befuddled</i> was simply the confused state too many pots of mead put your poor brain in, and that's still its basic meaning today. Nowadays, <i>befuddle</i> has a more general meaning of confusion and uncertainty not necessarily caused by too much booze.</p></div></div>`;
