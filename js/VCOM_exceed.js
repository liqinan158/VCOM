If you <i>exceed</i> the speed limit, you might get a speeding ticket.</p><p class="long"><i>Exceed</i> and <i>excess</i> share the Latin root <i>excedere</i> meaning to "go beyond."  An <i>excess</i> is too much of something, like the piles of candy after Halloween, and <i>exceed</i> means the action of going too far in a good or bad way. You exceed in school when you get straight A's. When Dr. Jekyll transforms into Mr. Hyde, he experiences "a grinding in the bones, deadly nausea, and a horror of the spirit that cannot be <i>exceeded</i> at the hour of birth or death." No thanks! It helps to remember that like <i>speed</i>, <i>exceed</i> ends with <i>-eed</i>.</p></div>`;
