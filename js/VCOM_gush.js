Things that <i>gush</i> come streaming out.</p><p class="long">Water can gush out of a hose or a drinking fountain, and you can also call the jet of water itself a gush. A more figurative way to gush is to talk enthusiastically about something — you might gush when you're describing your favorite teacher. <i>Gush</i> comes from the twelfth century English word <i>gosshien</i>, originally "make noises in the stomach," and later "pour out." <i>Gush</i> is an onomatopoeic word — it sounds like what it means.</p></div></div>`;
