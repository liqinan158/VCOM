var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">appositive</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">In grammar, an <i>appositive</i> word or phrase is one that describes the word or phrase right next to it. "My cat" is the <i>appositive</i> phrase in the sentence, "I'd like you to meet Burrito, my cat."</p><p class="long">While this adjective, strictly speaking, means "beside" or "adjacent," it's most commonly used to talk about grammar. If you say, "I saw Lady Gaga, a famous singer, at the supermarket," you've used the appositive phrase "a famous singer," which describes Lady Gaga. <i>Appositive</i> can also be used as a noun. In the song "Do-Re-Me," from <i>The Sound of Music</i>, the appositive "a deer" adds information, explaining exactly what a "doe" is.</p></div>`;
