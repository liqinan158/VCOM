Richard Nixon's diplomacy with China in the 1970's was an example of <i>realpolitik</i>.</p><p class="long">Realpolitik is put into practice when governments deal in straightforward, goal-oriented ways with other governments. Nixon's conversations with the communist Chinese government are such a good example of realpolitik because he felt diplomacy was important despite Americans' distrust of communism. The word <i>realpolitik</i>, coined in 1914, comes directly from German, in which it literally means "practical politics."</p></div></div>`;
