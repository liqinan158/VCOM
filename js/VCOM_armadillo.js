You're most likely to see an <i>armadillo</i> in South or Central America, or possibly in the southern US.</p><p class="long">Armadillos range from the size of a chipmunk to as big as a large dog. They're nocturnal, so they mostly hunt for food at night and sleep during the day, and are excellent diggers, with very sharp claws. Armadillos are distinctive because of the bony plates that cover them and their protective habit of rolling into a ball. <i>Armadillo</i> is Spanish, the diminutive form of <i>armado</i>, or "armored."</p></div>`;
