But it is often a mean word, suggesting leaving something or someone behind when they need you to stay. One way to remember the meaning of this verb — to abandon or desert — is to remember this little sentence: "<i>For</i> heaven's <i>sake</i>, don't leave me, or heaven is lost!" Lose the <i>heaven</i>, and you have <i>forsake</i>.</p></div>`;
