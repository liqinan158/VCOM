In the ancient world, <i>chariots</i> were usually the fastest way to travel, and also a convenient method for transporting armies and archery platforms.</p><p class="long">In ancient Rome, chariots were used in races and processions, while the Hittites used them for waging battles. Ancient Greece and Rome both had famous tales of warring charioteers, but both societies mainly used chariots for racing and parading. One Greek myth describes the sun god Helios's son, Phaethon, inexpertly driving the horse-drawn sun chariot for a day and nearly setting the Earth on fire.</p></div></div>`;
