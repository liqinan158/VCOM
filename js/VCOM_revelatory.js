A <i>revelatory</i> article in a tabloid paper might give you the scoop about a celebrity's (previously) private life.</p><p class="long">A revelatory artwork might show you something in a completely new light, like a giant art installation that incorporates the natural landscape around it, or a piece of music that stirs a deep feeling of nostalgia or sadness when you listen to it. People often describe religious experiences as revelatory, and early uses of <i>revelation</i> were also religious, meaning "disclosure of information from a divine source." The Latin root is <i>revelare</i>, "uncover or lay bare."</p></div></div>`;
