The <i>muteness</i> of the audience at a comedy show might indicate that the comedian isn't very funny â€” although <i>muteness</i> is probably preferable to outright booing.</p><p class="long">When it's a result of a physical or psychological condition or injury, you can also call muteness <i>mutism</i>. Both words come from <i>mute</i> and its Latin root <i>mutus</i>, "silent or speechless." In fact, <i>muteness</i> often simply means "silence." The muteness of your typically noisy family at dinner might be uncharacteristic, while the muteness of your meditation group is perfectly ordinary.</p></div>`;
