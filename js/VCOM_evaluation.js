For example, before you start an exercise program, get a medical <i>evaluation</i>, to make sure you're able to handle the activity.</p><p class="long">At the heart of the noun <i>evaluation</i> is the root word <i>value</i>, which means "worth." So an evaluation is an examination to find the worth of something. We do this every day â€” maybe making an evaluation of the prices in a store to decide whether or not to shop there. We might get an appraisal of our property, which is an evaluation to determine its worth in preparation for taking out a mortgage. Evaluation is vital in planning our lives.</p></div>`;
