And while your closet might be full of messy piles of shirts and sweaters, the ones you see at a clothing store are folded neatly in piles. <i>Neatly</i> comes from <i>neat</i>, which originally meant "free from dirt," and later gained the meaning "tidy." The Latin root is <i>nitidus</i>, "gleaming."</p></div></div>`;
