In many religions, monks and nuns practice <i>monasticism</i>.</p><p class="long">Do you live as though you're a monk in a monastery? Then you can describe your lifestyle as monasticism. In fact, all three of these words share the same Greek root, <i>monos</i>, or "alone." Monasticism is usually religious, but it can be used to describe any mode of living that's either solitary or within a community that's isolated from the rest of the world. Your monasticism may lead you to buy a cabin in the woods, where you can be self-sufficient and spend a lot of time meditating.</p></div></div>`;
