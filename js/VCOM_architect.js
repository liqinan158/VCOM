If you become an <i>architect</i>, you'll be responsible for drawing the blueprints, planning the work, and sometimes even overseeing the construction of a building.</p><p class="long">Frank Lloyd Wright was a famous <i>architect</i> who helped complete over 500 projects in his lifetime, including private homes, skyscrapers, museums, churches, and schools. Architects work on buildings of all types, and the Greek root <i>arkhitektōn</i> literally means “chief builder.”  An architect can construct other things too, like the architects who design a video game, or the architect of your misfortune who dumped green slime on your head at a school dance.</p></div></div>`;
