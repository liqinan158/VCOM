Either way, they're not the life of the party.</p><p class="long">This is a word that describes people and behaviors that are not very welcoming to others. Yelling, swearing, pushing, and generally being a jerk are all antisocial behaviors. Being a hermit and avoiding contact with other people is antisocial, too. Though this is a negative word, it's not entirely bad. We all need to get away from others once in awhile, and people who seem antisocial may just need a little space.</p></div></div>`;
