var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">fun</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you are having <i>fun</i>, you are having a good time. Watching little kids jump around inside an inflatable bouncy house, you can instantly tell how much <i>fun</i> they're having.</p><p class="long">There is no mistaking fun when you're having it, and it's generally used to mean exactly what it sounds like, some activity or experience that's purely enjoyable. When <i>fun</i> takes the form of an adjective, it's informal, not strictly grammatically correct. So while you can say, "Being with her is so much <i>fun</i>," you can't correctly say, "She is such a <i>fun</i> girl." <i>Fun</i> turns a little bit mean when you're making fun of, or teasing, your friend. In this case, it might be fun for you, but it's probably not very much fun for him.</p></div>`;
