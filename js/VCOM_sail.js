Part of learning to <i>sail</i> a boat is learning how to use the <i>sails</i>.</p><p class="long">Most sailboats have two sails, the mainsail and the jib or headsail on the front of the boat. When you sail, you pilot the boat, or simply ride on it â€” you can also say you go for a <i>sail</i>. Additionally, the verb <i>sail</i> is used when something seems to float on the air: "The kite <i>sails</i> high in the blue sky." You "<i>sail</i> through" something when it's very easy and quick.</p></div>`;
