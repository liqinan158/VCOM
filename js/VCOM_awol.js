Likewise, a volunteer at an animal shelter who skips his weekly shift is awol. This term is actually an acronym, an abbreviation of the military phrase "absent without leave." You'll often see it spelled in all capital letters: <i>AWOL</i>. The term became popular around World War II in the US military, and it caught on with civilians in the 1960s.</p></div>`;
