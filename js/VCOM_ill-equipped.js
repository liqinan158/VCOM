If you faint at the sight of blood, you're probably <i>ill-equipped</i> to be a surgeon.</p><p class="long">Soldiers without weapons or armor are ill-equipped for battle, and if you don't have an umbrella or a raincoat, you're ill-equipped for walking to school in the pouring rain. You might also be emotionally or temperamentally ill-equipped. If you are afraid of heights, you are most likely ill-equipped to be a roofer. When someone's <i>equipped</i>, they have the proper equipment, and when you add the prefix <i>ill-</i>, it's clear they're lacking what they need.</p></div>`;
