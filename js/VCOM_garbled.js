If you get a bad phone connection, your friend's message might sound <i>garbled</i>. Or, if you have rewritten the same sentence numerous times, its message might also be <i>garbled</i>.</p><p class="long">When you were young you may have played the game telephone, where one student thinks up a line, whispers it to his neighbor, who whispers it to his neighbor, and so on, down the line. At the end, the last person to receive the message shouts it out; it usually has nothing to do with what the first person said: it has been garbled along the way. Most of the change is accidental, the price of being human and imperfect — you hear "dope" rather than "hope." Besides messages, facts can get garbled — remember the history test where you wrote 1960 instead of 1860?</p></div></div>`;
