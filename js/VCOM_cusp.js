You'll see lots of cusps in Gothic churches — a point where two arches meet, or where decorative curves meet to form a point. The little points that stick out on the surface of your teeth that are flat on top — the ones you use for grinding — are also called <i>cusps</i>. Those teeth right behind your canine teeth but before your molars have two cusps, and they're called <i>bicuspids</i>.</p></div>`;
