If you get a bad burn, a doctor might clean it and cover it with <i>gauze</i>.</p><p class="long">In medicine, gauze has several uses. Sterile gauze is usually kept in a sealed package, to ensure that it's perfectly clean. It can be used to clean cuts, scrapes, and burns, and also acts as a large bandage. There is also a non-medical fabric called <i>gauze</i> that's used in light, warm-weather clothing. The word's origin is mysterious â€” one guess traces it to the Arabic <i>gazz</i>, or "raw silk."</p></div></div>`;
