Chemicals or even manure can be used for <i>fertilization</i>. That may not smell very nice, but your plants will grow better as a result.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>fertilization</i> also can refer to the process that allows humans and animals to reproduce. Fertilization occurs when an egg and sperm come together. Fertilization might happen if your dog keeps hanging out with that golden retriever down the street â€” then you can look forward to raising some puppies. Similarly, fertilization of a plant can occur when a bee transfers pollen from one flower to another.</p></div>`;
