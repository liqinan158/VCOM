var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">metaphysical</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Add the Greek prefix "meta-" (beyond) to the base "physical" (nature), and you get <i>metaphysical</i> â€” a near synonym to the Latinate word "supernatural." Both concern phenomena that are outside everyday experience or knowledge.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>metaphysical</i> entered the English language through Aristotle, whose <i>Metaphysics</i> is a collection of treatises that follows his <i>Physics.</i> <i>Physics</i> concerned natural philosophy, what we would call "science" today, while <i>Metaphysics</i> dealt with more abstract questions about the reality beyond what we perceive with our senses. Look at a physical object, say an apple. At what exact point did that apple come into existence? If you eat it, does it cease to exist, or does it still exist but in a changed way? These are metaphysical questions.</p></div>`;
