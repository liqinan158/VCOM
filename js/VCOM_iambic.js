var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">iambic</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">An <i>iambic</i> line of prose or poetry is one that consists of iambs. Got it? No, well let's try: an iamb is two consecutive syllables where the first is unstressed, the second stresed, as in "de-DUM." It's that simple.</p><p class="long">What do you get if you put five iambs together? No, it's not a joke, it's <i>iambic pentameter</i> (<i>penta</i> from the Greek for "five") as in: "de-DUM, de-DUM, de-DUM, de-DUM, de-DUM." It sounds better as: "If MU-/-sic BE / the FOOD / of LOVE,/ play ON." Now that's poetry. If <i>iambic pentameter</i> was good enough for Shakespeare, Milton, and Donne, then maybe you should give it a try.</p></div></div>`;
