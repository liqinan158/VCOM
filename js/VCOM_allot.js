Use the verb <i>allot</i> when you need to describe the act of assigning portions of something — be it snacks, time, or blame. The word is often used in the sense of an official group, such as a government or a corporation, dividing up and distributing small portions of something desirable, such as funding, shares, or land: “Zenitech Corporation was able to <i>allot</i> land rights to four groups in the area.”</p></div></div>`;
