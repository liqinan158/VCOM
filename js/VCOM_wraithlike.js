People walking on a foggy beach could look <i>wraithlike</i> from far away.</p><p class="long">Things appearing vague and shapeless can be described as <i>wraithlike</i>: a play might feature wraithlike dancers moving on a darkened stage, and the haunted house at the state fair might feature wraithlike creatures gliding around and screeching. This adjective comes from the noun <i>wraith</i>, or "ghost," which is Scottish in origin, possibly stemming from an Old Norse root that means "guardian angel."</p></div>`;
