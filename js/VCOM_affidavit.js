When you state something in an <i>affidavit</i>, you're pledging to the powers that be that you're not lying. The word usually appears in legal settings; if you watch a lot of cop shows or courtroom  dramas, it probably rings a bell. "According to the <i>affidavit</i>, Mrs. Smith told police she found the burglar in her closet wearing her most expensive pair of shoes."</p></div></div>`;
