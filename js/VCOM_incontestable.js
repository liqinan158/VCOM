The witness to a car accident could say that it's the incontestable fault of the driver who ran a red light. And once you've signed all the necessary forms and been handed the keys, you're the incontestable owner of your new car. <i>Incontestable</i> adds the "not" prefix, <i>in-</i>, to <i>contestable</i>, "opposable," or "arguable."</p></div></div>`;
