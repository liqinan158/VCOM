An easy way to <i>discomfit</i> another person is to use the age-old, childish trick of ignoring them. (Of course, we’re sure you would never do that, right? Right?)</p><p class="long">If you make someone blush, sweat, and generally want to disappear, you’ve <i>discomfited</i> her. Centuries ago, <i>discomfit</i> was used to mean “destroy completely in battle” — an experience that surely left the defeated armies feeling something more than mere discomfort. Some scholars have suggested that the contemporary meaning of <i>discomfit</i> arose due to confusion with the word <i>discomfort</i>. Don’t be <i>discomfited</i> by choosing the wrong word; use this word to mean “embarrass.”</p></div></div>`;
