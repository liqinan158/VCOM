If you like being pampered, you might treat yourself to a day at a spa.</p><p class="long">You might go to a spa to get a massage and sit in a sauna, or to visit the naturally warm springs in Sonoma, California or Saratoga Springs, New York. The springs themselves are often called <i>spas</i>, and as a result even a Jacuzzi bathtub with underwater jets is sometimes referred to as a <i>spa</i>. The word comes from the town of Spa, Belgium, which has been known for its mineral springs since the 15th century.</p></div></div>`;
