Visit a museum if you are in need of a dose of <i>culture</i>.</p><p class="long">A useful thing to remember about <i>culture</i> is that it is closely related to <i>cultivate</i>, whose root meaning is "to till the soil." Even in Latin, the source language, <i>cultura</i> was used metaphorically (Cicero said philosophy was <i>cultura animi</i>, the "cultivation of the soul"), and in English it moved from the agricultural sense to training, development of language and literature, mental development through education, and finally the ideas, customs, and intellectual and artistic conditions of a society or group.</p></div></div>`;
