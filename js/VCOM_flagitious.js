As sheriff, it's up to you to bring the <i>flagitious</i> outlaws to justice.</p><p class="long">Remember that <i>flagitious</i> has three syllables and the "t" is pronounced like "sh" (similar to "ambitious").  Use <i>flagitious</i> when you want to emphasize the extremely brutal nature of a crime or other bad action.  The crime scene photos showed the results of actions so flagitious you could not bear to look at them.</p></div>`;
