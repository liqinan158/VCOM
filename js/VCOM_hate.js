So much that you'd stay in bed even if your favorite movie star came by your house to make you your favorite breakfast? In that case, you could say you <i>hate</i> it.</p><p class="long"><i>Hate</i> is a powerfully strong verb, and it's one you should probably save for those things you really detest, that you have a passionately negative feeling about. An exception is when you use it in a sentence like, "I <i>hate</i> to bother you, but I'd like another cup of coffee." In this case, you're not using the word <i>hate</i> literally, but in more of a polite way; you simply want to emphasize that you're not trying to bother someone while still getting what you want.</p></div>`;
