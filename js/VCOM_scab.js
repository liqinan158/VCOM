Skin has an amazing ability to repair itself, and a scab is evidence of this. <i>Scab</i> is also a slang term for someone who crosses a picket line during a strike, choosing to work instead of joining coworkers in protesting low wages or harsh treatment by an employer. This kind of scab first meant "unpleasant person" in the late 1500s.</p></div>`;
