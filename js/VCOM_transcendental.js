You could describe the time you spend in the woods hiking as a physical and a <i>transcendental</i> experience.</p><p class="long">When something is transcendental, it's beyond ordinary, everyday experience. It might be religious, spiritual, or otherworldly, but if it's transcendental, it transcends — or goes beyond — the regular physical realm. The adjective <i>transcendental</i> is used to describe a particular kind of meditation, a specific school of philosophy, and even a type of number in mathematics. <i>Transcendental</i> and <i>transcend</i> come from the Latin word <i>transcendere</i>, or climb over or beyond.</p></div></div>`;
