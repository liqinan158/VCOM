A car thief's <i>premeditation</i> might include following a driver and noting where he typically parks his Mercedes.</p><p class="long">You're most likely to see the noun <i>premeditation</i> when someone's talking about crime. Almost any kind of crime or wrongdoing is considered worse, especially in a courtroom, if there's premeditation involved. An assault that's spontaneous isn't punished as harshly as one that involves premeditation, in which the attacker plans the assault before carrying it out. The Latin root, <i>praemeditationem</i>, combines <i>prae</i>, "before," and <i>meditari</i>, "to consider."</p></div>`;
