var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">hydraulic</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The adjective <i>hydraulic</i> refers to a process using pressurized water or other fluid to generate great mechanical power, without the wear and tear of gears or levers. <i>Hydraulic</i> systems are popular for use in heavy-duty machinery.</p><p class="long">It might seem odd that the original Greek word <i>hydraulik√≥s</i> from which <i>hydraulic</i> comes referred to water (<i>hydra</i>) and also to a musical instrument made from a hollow tube (<i>aulos</i>). You might ask, "What's a musical instrument got to do with <i>hydraulics</i>?" Well, you can see the connection when you know that something that's hydraulic means it is operated through the pressure of water or liquid through a pipe or hose, easily generating great force (instead of music).</p></div>`;
