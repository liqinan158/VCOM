A dairy farmer might catch milk in a metal bucket, announcing at the end of the morning, "I got six <i>buckets</i> of milk!" The expression "to kick the <i>bucket</i>" means to die â€” this particular meaning might stem from the French <i>buquet</i>, "balance," a beam that was used for hanging slaughtered animals.</p></div></div>`;
