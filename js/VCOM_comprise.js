The periodic table <i>comprises</i> 118 elements, because the whole <i>comprises</i> the parts.</p><p class="long">In its traditional use, the word <i>comprise</i> is the opposite of <i>compose</i>: if A comprises X, Y, and Z, then X, Y, and Z compose A. But because <i>compose</i> and <i>comprise</i> sound so much alike, people have long confused the two. So now you often hear things like "The band is <i>comprised</i> of a guitarist, a bassist, and a hairy drummer," whereas sticklers would prefer "is <i>composed</i> of" in that sentence. The word is undergoing a usage shift, making it just as hairy as that drummer!</p></div></div>`;
