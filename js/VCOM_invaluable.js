But some things––family photos, heirloom jewelry––are <i>invaluable</i>, meaning extremely valuable, or priceless.</p><p class="long">At first glance, you would think that <i>invaluable</i> means "not valuable." But to understand its meaning, you'd have to know that it was formed from the prefix <i>in-</i> "not" plus the verb <i>value</i>, plus the suffix <i>–able</i> "able to be." So something <i>invaluable</i> has such great value that its value can't be calculated.</p></div></div>`;
