It is the strongest way in English to express hatred, even stronger than <i>loathe</i>. We only use abhor in formal contexts; you might say "I abhor that man," but you would be less likely to say "I abhor spinach" unless you tend to express yourself in highfalutin terms no matter what the occasion.</p></div>`;
