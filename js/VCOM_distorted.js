Okay, so maybe your hair looked kind of weird that day, but your whole body wasn’t really that misshapen.</p><p class="long">This adjective is derived from the Latin verb <i>distortus,</i> which means “to twist different ways.” When something is distorted this can mean that it has been changed from the original form in any way. Someone can have a distorted worldview, or facts from an event can be distorted in the retelling. If a politician is misquoted in the newspaper, then it could be said that her opinion has been misrepresented or distorted by the media.</p></div></div>`;
