If you spend hours watching television shows about animals, maybe you’ve got an <i>ecologist</i> inside you trying to get out.</p><p class="long">To be an ecologist, first you have to learn about ecology — the study of organisms and how they relate to their environment. <i>Ecology</i> is a word that comes from the Greek <i>oikos</i>, meaning “house.”  Basically, ecologists study the environment like it’s a big house, and all the living creatures in it are roommates.
