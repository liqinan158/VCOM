If you know someone who talks just to hear his own voice, you can call what he says <i>blatherskite</i>.</p><p class="long">The person you're sitting beside on a long flight might spout blatherskite the whole time, or you might gradually realize a political speech is nothing but blatherskite. In both cases, the words don't really mean much, and there are far too many of them. <i>Blatherskite</i> became US slang in the early 19th century from <i>bletherskate</i>, or "foolish fellow," featured in the Scottish song "Maggie Lauder," which was popular with Continental soldiers during the American Revolution.</p></div></div>`;
