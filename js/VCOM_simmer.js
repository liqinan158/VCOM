But it can also be used to describe a feeling that's been simmering or slowly developing over time. It's also a word used to describe suppressed anger â€” that feeling just before you boil over. Just in case you do boil over, you might need to take a moment to simmer down, a casual expression that means, "Chill out, my friend."</p></div>`;
