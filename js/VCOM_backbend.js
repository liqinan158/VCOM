You have to be flexible to do a <i>backbend</i>.</p><p class="long">You might practice backbends as a gymnast, and also in yoga or dance class. Not only do you need a supple back to do a backbend, but strong abdominal muscles, steady legs, and a good sense of balance. In gymnastics, a basic backbend can lead to other moves, such as a back handspring. People with back problems should probably avoid doing backbends.</p></div></div>`;
