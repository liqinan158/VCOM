The <i>gn</i> part of both words comes from the Latin word for born, but the word root <i>mal</i> means "evil," while <i>bene</i> means "kind." A malignant tumor grows uncontrollably and spreads to other parts of the body. Less commonly, <i>malignant</i> can also be used to mean "evil or malicious," like when someone has a malignant imagination.</p></div>`;
