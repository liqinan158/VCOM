You may notice your <i>prying</i> neighbor peeking through his curtains whenever you have company.</p><p class="long">It's human nature to be curious, but when curiosity is taken too far, it's prying. Any crime or disaster is inevitably followed by crowds of prying reporters; and you might grow used to hiding your diary from the prying eyes of your little sister. <i>Prying</i> and its root, <i>pry</i>, come from <i>prien</i>, "to peer in," which may trace back to the Old English <i>bepriwan</i>, "to wink."</p></div>`;
