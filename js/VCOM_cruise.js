A <i>cruise</i> is a vacation spent on a ship that sails the ocean, periodically stopping in ports for sightseeing.</p><p class="long"><i>Cruise</i> can also be a verb that describes sailing around aimlessly for fun. You might cruise the canals of Venice in a small boat. If you don’t live in Venice, you can still cruise — but you might do it in your car. <i>Cruise</i> can be used to describe a leisurely drive taken just for fun. You might cruise around the neighborhood on a Saturday with no real destination in mind. <i>Cruise</i> can also describe traveling easily at a moderate speed.</p></div>`;
