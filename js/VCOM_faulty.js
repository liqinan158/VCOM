If your chocolate chip cookies keep coming out burned, your stove may be faulty — or you may be baking them too long. If your car's brakes are faulty, it won't stop as quickly as it should, and if your furnace is faulty, it will be a long, cold winter. <i>Faulty</i> and <i>fail</i> share a common Latin root word.</p></div></div>`;
