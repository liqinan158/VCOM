These Japanese pilots engaged in suicide missions: their goal was not only to harm the enemy, but they sacrificed their lives while doing so, crashing their planes. A kamikaze could be the pilot or the plane, and you can also speak of kamikaze missions. Today, the word is sometimes used for any situation that seems suicidal or risky.</p></div>`;
