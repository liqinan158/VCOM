When you're <i>slothful</i>, you don't want to do any work. You just want to lie around, eat bonbons, and maybe doze off a little.</p><p class="long">If you've ever seen the sloth — a slow-moving mammal — you won't be surprised that anyone slothful has a bad work ethic. When you're slothful, you don't feel like doing much of anything. Slothful people tend to sleep too much and lie around on the couch. Being slothful at work could get you fired, and slothful students won't do well at school. The furry kind of sloth is slow due to its nature, but a slothful person should get a move on!</p></div></div>`;
