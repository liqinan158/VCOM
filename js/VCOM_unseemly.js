It's a gentler, somewhat nicer word for "inappropriate" than its synonyms, the "in" words: "indecent, indecorous, indelicate, inelegant, inept" — well, you get the idea.</p><p class="long">Knowing that the "un-" prefix turns a word into its opposite, you'll see that <i>unseemly</i> means "not seemly." Let's look at that word (which is related to our verb <i>seem</i>), because it carries the real meaning. <i>Seemly</i> goes back to around 1200, to the Old Norse word <i>soemr</i>, "fitting, becoming." The negative "un-" was added in the early 14th century to denote the opposite meaning. "Seems" to make sense, doesn’t it?</p></div></div>`;
