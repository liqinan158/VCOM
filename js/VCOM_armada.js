In fact, some armadas look for pirates — another old-fashioned-sounding group that still exists. Though an armada is part of a navy, <i>armada</i> sounds similar to "army,", and it should: they both come ultimately from the same source, the Latin word <i>armata,</i> "armed." Armies and navies are two of the oldest branches of a military power, and an armada is a military fleet — another word for a group of boats or ships.</p></div>`;
