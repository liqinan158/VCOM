Drivers <i>violate</i> the law when they fail to stop at red lights, and people <i>violate</i> your privacy when they eavesdrop on your personal conversations.</p><p class="long"><i>Violate</i> comes from the Latin word <i>violatus</i> which means "to break," as in a promise or oath. As members of our society, we make unspoken promises — to follow all laws, to help people if we can, or at the very least, not hurt them. So when we violate — laws, property, people's abilities to live safe, peaceful lives — we break the promises that come with being lawful citizens.</p></div></div>`;
