A group of middle school kids might have a <i>fevered</i> reaction to the news that their favorite band is in town.</p><p class="long">While you can also use <i>fevered</i> to mean "hot" or "running a fever," it more commonly means "revved up" or "frenzied." A fevered imagination might turn spooky nighttime noises into a monster, and the arrival of a clown at a birthday party might cause both fevered excitement and terror from the guests. <i>Fevered</i> comes from <i>fever</i>, "high temperature," which has also meant "intense excitement" since the 16th century.</p></div>`;
