When a politician responds to a question <i>evasively</i>, she avoids a straightforward, honest answer.</p><p class="long">When you speak evasively, you come very close to lying â€” you're not being forthright, but are instead skirting around what's true. A criminal in court might answer a lawyer's questions evasively, and someone who's using a fake name might behave evasively when asked about his history. If you move evasively, you avoid being caught, and the Latin root, <i>evadere</i>, means "to get away or escape."</p></div>`;
