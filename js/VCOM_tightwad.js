var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">tightwad</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>tightwad</i> is someone who avoids spending money, like a relative who wraps a piece of junk from the basement in used wrapping paper and gives it to you, even though he or she could afford to buy you a nice birthday present.</p><p class="long">The “tight” part of this word refers to “close-fisted.” It’ll help you remember the meaning of <i>tightwad</i> if you picture a person with his fist tightly closed around a wad of money, not giving it up for anyone or anything. A tightwad takes being merely frugal or careful with money to a whole new level. It's not that tightwads are poor; they simply hate to part with their money, even if it's just a single dollar.</p></div></div>`;
