var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">fancier</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Someone crazy about something can be called a <i>fancier</i>. If you join a club to promote the well-being of pheasants, someone might describe you as "a pheasant <i>fancier</i>." That just means you like pheasants a lot.</p><p class="long">The word <i>fancier</i> can refer to someone who fancies (or really likes) something — such as dogs or wine or chocolate. It can also be used to describe someone who breeds a particular animal, with the intent of improving the breed. Make sure you don’t confuse this word with the adjective <i>fancy</i>, which has a comparative form that is also spelled “<i>fancier</i>.” That <i>fancier</i> would be used in the sense of “more ornamental” or “more extravagant” — as in "My prom dress is <i>fancier</i> than yours."</p></div>`;
