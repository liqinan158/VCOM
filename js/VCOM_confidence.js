A person who walks into a room, smiling at everyone and not at all nervous about the speech she's about to give? She has <i>confidence</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Confidence</i> comes from the Middle French word of the same spelling, which means "firmly trusting, bold." You can have confidence in yourself, another person, your country, even your rain boots — what you put your confidence in will not let you down. <i>Confidence</i> can also mean "in secret," like when your neighbor tells you in confidence that he and his family are thinking of moving away — he doesn't want others to know.</p></div>`;
