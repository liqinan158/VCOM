That's why it doesn't mean the same as <i>reward</i>. Instead, when you indulge, you enjoy or take part in something just because you want to â€” like indulging in a celebrity gossip magazine: you know you should be doing something more constructive, but you don't care. When you indulge someone else, you go along with whatever they want to do.</p></div></div>`;
