In his <i>haste</i> to finish the paper, he didn't notice he had replaced "taste" with "waste" during spell-checking, so his title became "Foods of Our Home State: What a Waste!"</p><p class="long">The old saying goes "<i>haste</i> makes waste," and when you try to do things too quickly, sometimes you do them wrong or have to do them all over again. You can use the noun <i>haste</i> for things done with extraordinary speed and often in a situation where there's pressure to perform or complete a task. "In her <i>haste</i> to catch the train she ran six blocks, but when she boarded, she noticed she was wearing one blue tennis shoe and one red one."</p></div></div>`;
