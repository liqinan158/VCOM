Usually, someone distinguished is older: distinguished people are wise, accomplished, and professional-looking â€” and usually have an impressive reputation to match. A teenager can't really be distinguished. They're too young to look the part, and they haven't done enough to earn the title. We admire people who are distinguished.</p></div></div>`;
