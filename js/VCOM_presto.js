Magicians love to yell <i>presto!</i> before a trick. In music, to play something <i>presto</i> is to play it at a very fast tempo.</p><p class="long"><i>Presto</i> comes from Italian for “quickly.” Officially, <i>presto</i> is the second-quickest speed that music can be played (after <i>prestissimo</i>). To a pianist, presto means one thing, while to a magician it means another. In this case, <i>presto</i> still means "fast," but it refers to the speed at which an illusion is created. If you dabble in magic tricks, you might say, "<i>Presto</i>!" at the moment you make a rabbit disappear or turn a silk scarf into a bouquet of flowers.</p></div>`;
