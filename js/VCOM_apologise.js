So if you need to say you're sorry for something you did in London, you should <i>apologise</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Apologise</i> comes from Greek word <i>apologia</i>, which means "a speech in defense of something." So use the verb <i>apologise</i> if you are making an excuse for, defending, or explaining some action. If you "accidentally" ate the last piece of pizza without offering it to anyone else and then burped in everyone's face at the table, you should probably apologise.</p></div>`;
