People who are diagnosed with <i>egomania</i> always put their own needs above those of others.</p><p class="long">Simply being vain or slightly self-absorbed isn't true egomania. People who actually suffer from egomania are out of touch with reality, having delusions of their own power and greatness, and often believe they're being persecuted or are terribly unappreciated by other people. The early 19th century word combines <i>ego</i>, "the self," or in Latin, <i>I</i>, with <i>mania</i>, "mental derangement," and in Greek "madness, passion, or fury."</p></div></div>`;
