"The trees and lights turned the campus into a <i>veritable</i> wonderland" means that the campus seemed to be transformed into a true wonderland (if there is such a thing).</p><p class="long"><i>Veritable</i> comes from the Latin <i>veritas</i> which means true. But unlike <i>true</i>, it does not describe things like statements. It is often used to enhance the word that follows it. "A <i>veritable</i> cornucopia of food" is a lot of food of different varieties. If someone calls you "a <i>veritable</i> force of nature," they don't mean that you are actually a hurricane; they just mean that you have the unstoppable quality of a big old storm.</p></div>`;
