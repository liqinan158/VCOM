Some of your favorite people are probably unpretentious, tending to be honest and genuine. When extremely talented or well-known people are unpretentious, they feel no need to show off or remind you of their accomplishments. A place can also be described as <i>unpretentious</i>, if it's simple and comfortable, like the cozy, unpretentious cafe where you like to hang out.</p></div>`;
