All of these things can be replaced with new versions of them once they break, wear out, or stop working. People are not replaceable — in fact, you could describe them as <i>irreplaceable</i>. Both words come from <i>replace</i>, with its "again" prefix <i>re-</i> and <i>place</i>, "to put somewhere."</p></div></div>`;
