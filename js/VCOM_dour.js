You might look <i>dour</i> on your way to picking up your last check from the job you just got fired from, and people should get out of your way.</p><p class="long"><i>Dour</i> and <i>endure</i> most likely come from the Latin word <i>durus</i> which means "hard." If something is hard to endure for a long enough time, it can make even the most happy-go-lucky person <i>dour</i>. <i>Dour</i> sounds like <i>sour</i> (or closer to "do-er"). It's a tomato/tamahto word, but either way â€” if you're in a sour mood, you have no sense of humor, and you're <i>dour</i>.</p></div>`;
