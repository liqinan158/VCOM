It's often a soldier, but not always. If you're watching a pot, waiting for it to boil, you're standing <i>sentinel</i> over it â€” and incidentally, it won't boil until you leave.</p><p class="long">Etymologists think <i>sentinel</i> stems from the Old Italian words <i>sentina</i>, meaning "vigilance," and  <i>sentire</i>, "to hear or perceive." It's a close cousin of <i>sentry</i>, which means the same thing. You can use <i>sentinel</i> as a noun or a verb. A kid in a snowball war might be the sentinel, patrolling the entrance to the fort. Wolves stand sentinel over their kill, stepping aside only for the alpha male, who always eats first.</p></div>`;
