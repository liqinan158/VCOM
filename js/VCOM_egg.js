When an <i>egg</i> hatches, a baby chick, snake, or lizard comes out.</p><p class="long">Fertile eggs are the ones that become animals, while those laid by infertile birds are the kind you eat, scrambled or fried, for breakfast. The ovum, a reproductive cell in female animals, including humans, is also an <i>egg</i>. Colloquially, if you "lay an <i>egg</i>," you make a total mess of something, and if you "have <i>egg</i> on your face," you look foolish. If, however, you're considered a "good <i>egg</i>," you're a pal or a nice person.</p></div></div>`;
