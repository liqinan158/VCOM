In other words, the air will gently carry this familiar aroma throughout the house.</p><p class="long">Though the verb <i>waft</i> usually involves movement through air, it has watery roots. A "wafter" was a convoy ship in the 16th century, and these words may have derived from the similar looking <i>wave.</i> <i>Waft</i> can refer to scents, sounds, and even smoke. So, if your grandmotherâ€™s sauce begins to burn, smoke could waft from the kitchen as well.</p></div></div>`;
