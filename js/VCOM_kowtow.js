Now it refers to acting like you're doing that, whether you actually bow or not.</p><p class="long"><i>Kowtow</i> is derived from the Chinese word <i>k’o-t’ou</i>, which literally means “knock the head.” As a verb, <i>kowtow</i> has the sense of “sucking up” or "flattering." Maybe you’re wondering when it would be appropriate to kowtow. The answer? When you want to worship, show respect, gain favor, or flatter. You might need to kowtow to your teacher if you failed a test, but if you kowtow to all your neighbor's requests, you might wind up mowing his lawn all summer.</p></div>`;
