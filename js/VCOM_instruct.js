To <i>instruct</i> is to give instructions, to teach.</p><p class="long">Teachers are often called instructors because their job is to instruct, to give knowledge or instructions. The subtle difference between "teach" and <i>instruct</i> is that you can teach almost anything: concepts, ideas, theories or, say, history. When you instruct someone, you're giving them a set of tools or tasks to do something specific. That's why furniture, toys, and model rocket kits come with instructions: they instruct you how to assemble them.</p></div></div>`;
