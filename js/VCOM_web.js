Other webs are more figurative, like the web of connections between people who work in the same field or the web of rules and regulations attached to filing your income tax return. There's also the World Wide <i>Web</i>, known as the Internet or just "the <i>Web</i>," named this way because it's a web-like series of interconnected documents and links.</p></div>`;
