You could say, "I have to go to the store soon. In the <i>meantime</i>, I'm playing with the dog." This word has been around since the fourteenth century, although it was originally two separate words, <i>mean time</i>. Its root is the word <i>mean</i>, which means "middle or intermediate."</p></div>`;
