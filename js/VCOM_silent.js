After your noisy houseguests leave, you'll probably enjoy being all alone in your <i>silent</i> house.</p><p class="long">Sometimes a silent reading period in a third grade class truly is silent â€” and other times, the sound of soft giggling can be heard. People are silent when they don't speak, and a silent film has no soundtrack. You might exchange a silent message with your best friend without using words, just by raising your eyebrows or shrugging your shoulders. The Latin root of <i>silent</i> is <i>silere</i>, "be quiet or still."</p></div>`;
