Their parenting style might be described as <i>lax</i>. A paperclip chain used as a bike lock? That's an example of <i>lax</i> security.</p><p class="long">While contemplating the word <i>lax</i>, you may note that it's the same as the first syllable in <i>laxative</i>. This is not a coincidence: <i>lax</i> entered English as a noun describing a substance taken or administered to relax the bowels. Interestingly, the modern definition of <i>lax</i> is closer to the Latin source word, <i>laxus</i> â€” an adjective meaning "loose." Now, <i>lax</i> can refer to any phenomenon that is insufficiently stringent or so slack as to be basically ineffectual. For example, "The entire class performed incredibly well on the test, largely due to the sleepy professor's <i>lax</i> supervision."</p></div>`;
