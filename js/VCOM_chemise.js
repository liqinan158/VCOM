If you're heading to the beach, you might throw a <i>chemise</i> on over your bathing suit.</p><p class="long">Use the word <i>chemise</i> for an unstructured garment without any defined waist — think of the dresses flappers wore in the 1920s, which hung straight down from their shoulders. It's just as common to call a nightgown or a slip — a type of undergarment worn beneath a dress — a chemise. The word comes from Old French, meaning "tunic," and was originally used for the tunics worn by soldiers beneath their armor.</p></div></div>`;
