He says, "Will all great Neptuneâ€™s ocean wash this blood clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather the multitudinous seas <i>incarnadine</i>, making the green one red." Macbeth means that there is not enough water in the sea to cleanse his hands, but instead the blood on them will stain the ocean red.</p></div></div>`;
