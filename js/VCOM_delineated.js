More often, you will hear the word in relation to something less tangible — like how a character in a novel is delineated, or depicted, by an author, or a politician who gave a speech in which her position was delineated, or defined. You might try to remember the word <i>delineated</i> by thinking of it as something with clearly defined <i>lines</i>.</p></div></div>`;
