But <i>generation</i> is also the act of creating something, such as income, ideas or kids.</p><p class="long">In 1965, Pete Townsend, the guitarist of The Who, wrote a song called "My Generation." The Who, Jefferson Airplane, Jimi Hendrix and other popular musicians of the day were called “the Woodstock Generation,” because they performed at a famous music festival in Woodstock, New York.  <i>Generation</i> is used in another way when people credit those bands — along with Elvis, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones — with the generation of rock-and-roll culture.</p></div>`;
