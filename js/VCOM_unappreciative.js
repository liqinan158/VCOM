It will probably be frustrating to throw an elaborate surprise party for your notoriously <i>unappreciative</i> cousin.</p><p class="long">To be appreciative is to show gratitude â€” by thanking someone, for example. Add the prefix <i>un-</i> ("not"), and you've got the exact opposite. If you're unappreciative of something that's been done for you or given to you, you'll seem ungrateful or even rude. If you've ever had a friend who never seemed to acknowledge your efforts, you know just what <i>unappreciative</i> means.</p></div></div>`;
