In other words, it's a decade. Call a decade a <i>decennary</i> if you’re feeling like an old fashioned British lawyer.</p><p class="long">Like <i>decade</i> and <i>decagon</i> (polygon with ten sides), <i>decennary</i> comes from the Latin root <i>decem</i> for “ten.” A hundred years is made up of ten decennaries. People tend to make a big deal about birthdays that end a decennary, like turning 10, 20, or 30, etc.. A decennary is also known as a decennium. An old definition for this word is “ten neighboring families,” but that definition is from a few decennaries ago.</p></div></div>`;
