Before the vaccine was developed, mumps was a common childhood illness. It's spread through coughs and sneezes, and while it's often mild, there are complications that can be serious, like brain infections and deafness. The name <i>mumps</i> comes from the now-obsolete <i>mump</i>, "a grimace," from a previous meaning, "to whine like a beggar." In the seventeenth century, <i>mumps</i> also meant "a fit of melancholy."</p></div></div>`;
