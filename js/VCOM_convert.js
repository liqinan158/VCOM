In this case, the Latin <i>con</i> means "around," while <i>vertere</i> means "turn." So we can figure that <i>convert</i> means to "turn around," an object or one's thoughts on an idea. For example, you might <i>convert</i> a meat eater into a vegetarian or an empty-nester might <i>convert</i> the kids' bedroom into an exercise room.</p></div></div>`;
