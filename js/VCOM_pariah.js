The pariahs were drummers, sorcerers, and servants who became untouchables in Indian society because of the unsanitary jobs they did. <i>Pariah</i> maintains this sense of untouchableness. Pariahs are not just unliked, they are avoided at all costs. Imagine how a once popular restaurant could gain pariah status if it fails health inspections three times in a row.</p></div></div>`;
