If a baseball team is defeated <i>ignominiously</i>, it's so badly trounced that every player feels embarrassed about the game.</p><p class="long">If a government uses violence against political protesters, silencing them and blocking their access to reporters and the Internet, it behaves ignominiously. If you cheat on a test, you're acting ignominiously and should feel ashamed about it. In Latin, <i>ignominiosus</i> means "disgraceful or shameful," from the root <i>ignominia</i>, literally "loss of a good name." In other words, if you act ignominiously, you risk losing your good name.</p></div></div>`;
