If you want to be a <i>granger</i> one day, you might get a job on a dairy farm or go to agricultural school.</p><p class="long">While the twelfth century word <i>granger</i> isn't used much these days, it was a common way to refer to a farmer in the late 1800s United States. The noun <i>granger</i> comes from the Old French <i>grange</i>, "barn or farm house," ultimately from the Latin <i>granum</i>, "grain." The word <i>grange</i> came to mean a U.S. farmers' association which worked for the rights of small farmers and built Grange Halls across the country for grangers' meetings and gatherings.</p></div>`;
