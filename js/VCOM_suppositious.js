If there's no evidence that your brother stole your favorite sweatshirt, it's <i>suppositious</i> to accuse him of the deed.</p><p class="long">When you use <i>supposition</i>, or an unproven belief, to decide something, that's suppositious. Both words come from <i>suppose</i> and its root, which means "to assume." This adjective is uncommon today â€” you're more likely to say "unfounded" or "based on an assumption." Still, feel free to pull out <i>suppositious</i> for situations such as the suppositious evidence a substitute teacher uses to punish the whole class for passing notes.</p></div></div>`;
