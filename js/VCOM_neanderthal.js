If your brother interrupts your garden party by spraying your guests with a hose, you can call him a <i>neanderthal</i>.</p><p class="long">When <i>neanderthal</i> is spelled with a lower-case <i>n</i>, it means a cretin or a dolt â€” a rough, mean, and slightly foolish person. If you spell it with a capital <i>N</i>, it means an extinct species of human being, and it's the root of the lower-case version. The word <i>Neanderthal</i> is German, named for the Neander Valley where human fossils have been found, and around 1926 <i>neanderthal</i> became popular British slang for a "big, brutish, stupid person."</p></div></div>`;
