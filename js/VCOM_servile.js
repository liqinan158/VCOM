To call someone <i>servile</i> is an insult.</p><p class="long">To remember <i>servile</i>, think of the word <i>servant</i> — they both derive from the Latin <i>servus</i>, "enslaved person." The Servile Wars, for example, refer to slave revolts in the Roman Empire. These days, <i>servile</i> describes someone who is so eager to please that it makes you cringe. If you apologize when someone else steps on your foot, you’re being servile.</p></div></div>`;
