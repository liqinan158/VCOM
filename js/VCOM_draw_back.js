At the sight of the large snake held by a zookeeper, most children will <i>draw back</i> â€” except for the extreme reptile fans.</p><p class="long">You might draw back from the edge of a cliff once you realize how high up the mountain you've climbed, or draw back from your dog after she's rolled in something particularly stinky. There's also a figurative way to draw back, when you change your mind, deciding to do something different than what was expected: "It surprised me when she decided to <i>draw back</i> from studying music and major in economics instead."</p></div>`;
