Your <i>genome</i> is all the genetic material contained in your 23 pairs of chromosomes, a total of more than 20,000 genes.</p><p class="long">Every organism has its own unique genome. "The Human <i>Genome</i> Project," completed in 2003, was an international effort to identify all the genes in human DNA and to determine the sequences of the 3 billion (yes, billion) base pairs â€” the smaller units that make up DNA. It took 13 years. Genome research has helped diagnose disease and find genetic markers for certain diseases.</p></div>`;
