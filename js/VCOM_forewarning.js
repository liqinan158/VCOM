You might give your elderly grandmother <i>forewarning</i> about her upcoming surprise birthday party, for example.</p><p class="long">When Paul Revere famously rode through Boston alerting patriots that British troops had landed and were preparing to attack, he gave them forewarning about the army's advance. Since they knew about it before it happened, there was time to prepare. The <i>fore</i> part of <i>forewarning</i> is from Old English roots, and it means "before in time," or "in advance of." <i>Warning</i> also comes from Old English, originally <i>warnian</i>, "to give notice of impending danger."</p></div>`;
