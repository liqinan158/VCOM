The most famous American <i>confederacy</i> consisted of the southern states who fought the northern states in the American Civil War.</p><p class="long">When you confederate — that is, join together for a common purpose — what you get is a confederacy. Americans will never forget a well-known but ill-fated confederacy, the Confederate States of America: an unrecognized state that formed in 1861, uniting the slave states that left the United States at the time of the Civil War. Any such political union could be called a confederacy (or a federation). When you see the word <i>confederacy</i>, think of togetherness in the political realm.</p></div>`;
