Most surgeries require some form of sedation, but to be <i>sedate</i> in day-to-day life means composed, quiet, and serene. Not necessarily unconscious.</p><p class="long">To be <i>sedate</i> when dining with the Queen means that you behaved with dignity and solemnity. To be <i>sedated</i> when dining with the Queen means that you were face down in the bread pudding and drooling onto the tablecloth. The medical sense of the word is to be tranquilized, either to calm your nerves after a shock or in preparation for surgery. Socially, to be <i>sedate</i> is to be serene, quiet, and composed.</p></div>`;
