When you look through <i>binoculars</i>, far-off things appear much closer.</p><p class="long">Binoculars are like a telescope for both eyes at the same time â€” they make it possible to see distant objects more clearly. Sailors, hikers, tourists, and soldiers all occasionally use binoculars, and so do some audience members at the opera, who use special small binoculars called "opera glasses." The noun comes from an adjective, <i>binocular</i>, which means "having two eyes," or "involving both eyes," from the Latin <i>bini</i>, "two by two" and <i>ocularis</i>, "of the eye."</p></div>`;
