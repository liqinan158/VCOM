If you'd like to keep a <i>walrus</i> for a pet, you'll need a big pool full of salt water and plenty of clams, a <i>walrus's</i> favorite snack.</p><p class="long">Walruses are very distinctive, both for their tusks and whiskers and their size: some male walruses weigh over 2,000 pounds. They are extremely important in Arctic indigenous culture and are referenced frequently in Western culture as well. A couple of famous examples are Lewis Carroll's oyster-eating walrus in "The Walrus and the Carpenter." and the mysterious reference in the Beatles' "I Am the Walrus."</p></div></div>`;
