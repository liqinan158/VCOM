It's easier to say than <i>contemporaries</i>, but they mean the same thing. Young, old, or in-between, if people are the same age and living in the same era, they're <i>contemporaries</i>.</p><p class="long">You might be wondering what the noun <i>contemporaries</i> has to do with the adjective <i>contemporary</i>, which describes things that happen at the same time or in the present. Both words share a common Latin origin â€” <i>con</i>, meaning "together with," and <i>tempus</i>, meaning "time." Amaze your friends at the art museum by saying, "In this contemporary gallery, the artists who created the paintings are all contemporaries."</p></div>`;
