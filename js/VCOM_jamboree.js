You can call any large celebration a jamboree, as long as it's full of celebration and raucous enthusiasm. <i>Jamboree</i> is an American English invention from the 1860's. The word's origin isn't certain, although experts suspect a connection to <i>shivaree</i>, or <i>charivari</i>, a French folk tradition of greeting a newly married couple by making a whole lot of noise, in a mock serenade.</p></div></div>`;
