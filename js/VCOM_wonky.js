Something that’s <i>wonky</i> isn’t necessarily broken; it’s just slightly “off.”</p><p class="long"><i>Wonky</i> can also describe something that isn't working correctly, such as an old TV set that shows only one channel, or maybe even your brain after you’ve just pulled an all-nighter. Important: Don't confuse <i>wonky</i> with <i>wonk</i>. A wonk is an extremely studious person, and usually wonks are very far from being wonky (except perhaps in terms of their social skills).</p></div>`;
