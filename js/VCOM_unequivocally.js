The word can be traced to the Latin <i>aequivocus</i>, meaning "ambiguous." The addition of the prefix "un" turns the meaning around to "not equivocally."  Economist John Kenneth Galbraith once said, "All of the great leaders have had one characteristic in common: it was the willingness to confront unequivocally the major anxiety of their people in their time."</p></div></div>`;
