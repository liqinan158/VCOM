You may find rotting meat <i>repulsive</i>, but maggots find it delicious.</p><p class="long">In the early 17th century, the word <i>repulsive</i> simply meant something that repelled or "pushed away." For example, the like poles of two magnets are <i>repulsive</i> to each other, pushing each other away. Today, <i>repulsive</i> usually means disturbing and sickening.  As manners guru Amy Vanderbilt said, "Do not speak of repulsive matters at the table."</p></div>`;
