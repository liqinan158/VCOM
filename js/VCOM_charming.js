More rarely, it can be something supernatural.</p><p class="long"><i>Charms</i> are magical objects and something <i>charming</i> puts you under its spell. In most cases, we mean that only figuratively â€” if you spent a charming evening with friends, it means their company was so wonderful it was almost enchanting. Charming people have a special, almost magical way of making others like them. But if you're talking about a charming witch, you better watch out for her sorcery and magic tricks.</p></div></div>`;
