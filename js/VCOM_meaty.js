Believe it or not, a <i>meaty</i> portobello mushroom can be a good substitute for a hamburger.</p><p class="long">If you serve your guests a thick, meaty stew, that means it's actually full of chunks of meat, and when you cook a pan of vegetarian "bacon," it may smell so good and meaty that you tempt even your most carnivorous friends. A figurative way for something to be <i>meaty</i> is to be full of information or substance. A meaty essay will make your history teacher much happier than one that's thin and hastily written.</p></div></div>`;
