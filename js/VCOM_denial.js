"When asked if he ate the powdered doughnut, he gave a flat <i>denial</i>. Since his face was covered with powdered sugar, the <i>denial</i> was ludicrous."</p><p class="long">To be "in <i>denial</i>" is to be fooling yourself about the reality of your situation. If you stay up late watching TV on the eve of your AP Biology final, you are probably in <i>denial</i> about your lack of preparation for the test. Now, "self-<i>denial</i> is a whole other thing; that is when someone puts others first: "During the drought, Mary made sure all her neighbors had enough water and she lived in a state of self-<i>denial</i> â€” relying on Mountain Dew as her only source of hydration."</p></div>`;
