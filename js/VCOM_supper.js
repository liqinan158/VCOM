Many families try to sit down and eat <i>supper</i> together at the end of the day.</p><p class="long">First comes breakfast, then lunch, and then finally, in the evening, it's time for supper. The word <i>supper</i> is less common today than <i>dinner</i>, although North Americans generally consider the words to be synonyms. Until the early 20th century, the meal we now generally refer to as <i>lunch</i> was called <i>dinner</i>, while the evening meal was <i>supper</i>. It comes from the Old French <i>soper</i>, "to eat the evening meal."</p></div>`;
