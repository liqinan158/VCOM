In many countries today, kings and queens are merely <i>figureheads</i>.</p><p class="long">A ceremonial president or king — one installed as a symbolic head of a country, while someone else holds the real power — is one type of figurehead. If a retiring businesswoman promotes her son to be the new CEO of her company, while putting a different person in charge of running the business, the son is just a figurehead. The word <i>figurehead</i> comes from its original meaning, the figures carved at the front of old sailing ships.</p></div></div>`;
