Everything in an <i>ecosystem</i> has an important role. Well, almost everything.</p><p class="long">The term <i>ecosystem</i> was coined in 1935, though ecosystems have been around as long as living things. <i>Eco</i> is a spin-off from the word <i>ecology</i> and describes anything having to do with the environment and our relation to it. You've probably heard of related terms like <i>eco-friendly</i> and <i>eco-warrior</i>. And <i>system</i> comes from the Greek word <i>systema</i> or "organized body, whole."</p></div>`;
