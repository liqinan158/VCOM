Either way, it's the dissection of a corpse performed to learn something about the cause of death or about a particular disease. Frequently the word <i>necropsy</i> is used when the body being examined is not human â€” in the case of a laboratory animal, for example. Whenever you see the prefix <i>necro</i>, you can be sure the word has something to do with death. In this case, it's combined with <i>opsis</i>, "a sight" in Greek.</p></div>`;
