The <i>attraction</i> of a college might be its sports program, for example, or the <i>attraction</i> of a job might be its high pay.</p><p class="long">An attraction can be a physical force as well as a psychological one â€” though sometimes, as with love, it can be hard to tell the two apart. Planets have a gravitational attraction to each other, as do opposite magnetic poles. <i>Attraction</i> can also refer to a public entertainment, such as a popular place or a performer or event. You might line up to visit a tourist attraction, or look forward to seeing the main attraction go onstage.</p></div></div>`;
