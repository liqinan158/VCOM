You could call your apartment building an <i>eyesore</i> if it's a huge, ugly concrete structure that looms over your street.</p><p class="long">Most eyesores are structures or buildings â€” an old, decrepit house that's sagging on one side and has a yard full of weeds is probably thought of as an eyesore by most of its neighbors. You might also describe a new hotel as an eyesore if it's painted a strange shade of pink that clashes with the buildings nearby. The word <i>eyesore</i> has been around since the 1500's, from the idea of "something so offensive to the eye that it hurts."</p></div></div>`;
