When you use <i>peg</i> as a verb, it means to identify someone or something: "I <i>pegged</i> you as a word lover, the first time I laid eyes on you."</p><p class="long">A coat rack might consist of a line of wooden pegs, and you might also secure a tent by driving metal pegs into the ground to hold it there. When you fasten or pierce something with a peg, you can say you <i>peg</i> it. Informally, if you peg a person, you make a judgment about them: "I'd <i>peg</i> him as a messy housekeeper based on the way his dorm room looks."</p></div></div>`;
