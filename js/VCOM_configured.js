var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">configured</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the adjective <i>configured</i> to describe something that's organized in a very specific way, for a particular use. A classroom, for example, is <i>configured</i> for play and learning.</p><p class="long">A modern zoo is configured so that animals have plenty of room to move around, and a baker's ideal kitchen is configured with space for kneading and rolling dough. When something's configured, it's arranged or set up to serve a purpose. The word comes from the verb <i>configure</i>, which is rooted in the Latin <i>configurare</i>, "to fashion after a pattern," from the stems <i>con</i>, "together," and <i>figurare</i>, "to shape."</p></div></div>`;
