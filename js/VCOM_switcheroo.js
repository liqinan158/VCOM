If your mom replaced the cookies in a cookie jar with plums, your dad might say, "She pulled the old <i>switcheroo</i>!"</p><p class="long">Most often, a switcheroo is a joke or trick â€” a magician might appear to change your ten dollar bill into a feather, and you could call this a switcheroo. Another kind of switcheroo is simply an abrupt change of direction, like a sudden switcheroo in a movie's plot that leaves you totally confused. <i>Switcheroo</i> was first used, in an informal and joking way, in 1933.</p></div></div>`;
