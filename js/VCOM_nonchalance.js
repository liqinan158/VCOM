var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">nonchalance</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Nonchalance</i> is a casual lack of concern, a relaxed state without anxiety or enthusiasm.  Like how you'd act if the girl you've had a secret crush on since grade school asks you to the prom.  (Or maybe not.)</p><p class="long">It's hard to achieve nonchalance. If you're like most people, there's always going to be something that will rattle you.  And you can forget about behaving with chalance, because chalance isn't a word. Sometimes you hear people say that so-and-so acted with "studied <i>nonchalance</i>," which means to sort of fake it. Oddly, the word's origins go back to the Latin <i>calere</i>, which is the same word as the root of <i>calorie</i>.  A calorie is a unit of energy, and to act with nonchalance is to refrain from showing too much energy or excitement, so actually, it makes sense.</p></div>`;
