Ancient oracles were thought to be mystic people that had some direct connection with the gods, like ancient Greece's famous Oracle at Delphi. There the oracle would sit over an open fissure in the rocks, inhaling strange fumes and speaking in oracular gibberish that had to be "interpreted" by a priest. Sounds like you might have better luck with a palm reader.</p></div></div>`;
