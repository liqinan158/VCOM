For example: the fact that you aced the SAT <i>attests</i> to the strength of your vocabulary.</p><p class="long"><i>Attest</i> and <i>testify</i> come from the same Latin word <i>testari</i>, which means "to declare." Although both words are kind of formal, you often <i>testify</i> in a courtroom, but <i>attest</i> doesn't require a court of law to function. You can attest to anything â€” that the funny looking shoes toned your thighs, that what someone says is true, or that the new acne medicine really works. To remember it, think of when you pass a test, you attest that you know the material.</p></div></div>`;
