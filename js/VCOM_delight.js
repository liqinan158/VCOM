You mean you think she's great: a <i>delight</i> is a source of joy, and to <i>delight</i> is to cause pleasure.

The word <i>delight</i> derives from the Latin <i>delectare</i> "to charm," which also gives us <i>delectable,</i> and the same lighthearted sense of pure, uncomplicated pleasure.</p></div>`;
