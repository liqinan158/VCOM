var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">excitable</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Someone who's <i>excitable</i> easily becomes excited, enthusiastic, or eager. A five-year-old will be especially <i>excitable</i> at her own birthday party.</p><p class="long">When you describe someone as <i>excitable</i>, you'll usually mean it as a mild criticism — the person is easily overstimulated, and becomes excited far too readily. Passing out candy in an elementary school classroom — or bacon among a bunch of puppies — will demonstrate just how excitable a group can be. <i>Excitable</i> comes from the Latin <i>excitabilis</i>, "inciting or animating," from <i>excitare</i>, "stir up" or "awaken."</p></div></div>`;
