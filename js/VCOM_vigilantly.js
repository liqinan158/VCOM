Your dog might <i>vigilantly</i> guard her special bone, growling a little when the cat walks too close to it.</p><p class="long">Doing things vigilantly means acting with attentiveness. The adverb should make you think of a night watchman vigilantly watching a security camera or a Great Pyrenees vigilantly protecting a flock of sheep from predators. The adverb comes from its related adjective, <i>vigilant</i>, or "keeping careful watch." The Latin root of both words is <i>vigilantia</i>, or "wakefulness."</p></div></div>`;
