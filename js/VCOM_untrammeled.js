If you live a truly <i>untrammeled</i> life, you feel free to follow your dreams.</p><p class="long">As opposed to a lion in a zoo, a wild animal is untrammeled, or free to roam. You could also describe a dictator's power as untrammeled, in a much less positive sense â€” he is free to make any laws he wants, and to treat his subjects however he chooses. <i>Untrammeled</i> comes from <i>trammel</i>, or "restriction," which also refers to a particular kind of fishing net. The root is Late Latin, <i>tremaculum</i>, "net made of three layers."</p></div></div>`;
