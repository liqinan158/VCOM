Then you're familiar with your <i>diaphragm,</i> the large muscle that stretches across your midriff to support your lungs and help you breathe. When you get the hiccups, your <i>diaphragm</i> spasms uncontrollably.</p><p class="long">The Greek word <i>diáphragma</i> referred to the body's midriff and came from the root <i>phrágma</i>, meaning "fence." This led to the Middle English <i>diafragma</i>, also referring to the muscular stretch below the lungs. The idea of a diaphragm as a contraceptive first surfaced in 1933. A diaphragm is also the part of the camera called a "stop," which adjusts the amount of light, and it is a thin, vibrating disc used in electronics to transfer sound.</p></div></div>`;
