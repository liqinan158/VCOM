It can mean "to be apparent, or probable," like the nice person you just met who seems like he'll make a good friend. <i>Seem</i> can also mean "to appear to exist," like when heat shimmering on pavement makes it seem like there is a puddle on the road. The word comes from the Old Norse word <i>soema</i> meaning "to befit, conform to."</p></div></div>`;
