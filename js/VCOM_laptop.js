The big computer on your desk is a desktop, and the small one on your lap is a <i>laptop</i>. See what they did there? Now shoo that lapdog and get to work!</p><p class="long">There are other kinds of portable computers, but a laptop usually has a screen that folds over the keyboard when you’re not using it. The earliest versions of laptops were made in the 1970s, and they've become lighter, thinner, more portable, and much more popular since then. The word <i>laptop</i> was coined in 1984, based on — you guessed it — <i>desktop</i>, which describes the heavier, non-portable computer.</p></div>`;
