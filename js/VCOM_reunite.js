And when a large family — all of the aunts, uncles, cousins, and second cousins — has a reunion, they also reunite. Both <i>reunion</i> and <i>reunite</i> come from the Latin root <i>unus</i>, or "one," and the "again" prefix <i>re-</i>, so <i>reunite</i> means "make as one again."</p></div></div>`;
