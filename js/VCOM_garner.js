If you want to run for office without belonging to a political party, you must <i>garner</i> enough signatures — usually a few thousand — to get onto the ballot.</p><p class="long">The word <i>garner</i> comes from the Latin <i>granarium</i> which means "store-house," usually for grain. The current use of the word carries with it the sense of something being stored up. It’s not only that you can gather enough yes-votes to overcome the opposition, there is the sense that all the things you have garnered have some weight of their own. In its other use, <i>garner</i> means “earn” or "merit." Think of movie stars garnering Oscar nominations for their excellent work.</p></div></div>`;
