A <i>discrete</i> unit is a separate part of something larger. A room is a <i>discrete</i> space within a house, just as the crankshaft is a <i>discrete</i> part of a car engine.</p><p class="long">If something is discrete, it has its own space. An ice cube comes from an ice tray, but it has its own discrete compartment. A student government might have discrete committees for different projects. Don't confuse <i>discrete</i> with its close cousin <i>discreet</i>, which means “appropriately private.” Billionaire Bruce Wayne, for example, is very discreet about his secret life as Batman. You could say Batman is a discrete, or separate, part of Bruce Wayne’s identity. Anything distinct and separated is discrete.</p></div></div>`;
