When someone in a movie bellies up to a bar and orders a well-known brand of beer, it's usually a <i>lager</i>.</p><p class="long">Brewers distinguish lagers from other beers by the yeast used to ferment it, as well as its light color and what's often described as the "crisp" taste of a lager. This type of beer was first invented in 15th-century Bavaria. The name <i>lager</i> comes from <i>lager beer</i> and its German source, <i>Lagerbier</i>, or "beer brewed for keeping," a reference to the practice of storing lager in cold places while it matures.</p></div></div>`;
