If you are banned from the library <i>in perpetuity</i> after that one time you stood on a table and played your trumpet, it means that you will never be allowed back.</p><p class="long">Using the adverbial phrase <i>in perpetuity</i> is a formal way to say "forever and ever," or "indefinitely," or "until further notice." A truly sustainable form of energy will provide power in perpetuity, and the words of a brilliant, important poet will last in perpetuity. The root is the Latin word <i>perpetuitatem</i>, "uninterrupted duration or continuity,", and it's related to <i>perpetual</i>, or "never ending."</p></div></div>`;
