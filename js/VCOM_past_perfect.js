var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">past perfect</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">In grammar, the <i>past perfect</i> is a verb tense you use to talk about something that happened and was finished in the past. The sentence "He had arrived the day before" is in the <i>past perfect</i> tense.</p><p class="long">The past perfect — which you can also call the "pluperfect" — always includes the word <i>had</i>. While a sentence like "We saw that movie" is in the simple past tense, "We had already seen that movie" is in the past perfect. The term <i>past perfect</i> reflects the fact that this peculiar verb tense combines the past with what's known as the <i>perfect</i> in grammar, demonstrating that an action happened earlier than the time you're talking about.</p></div></div>`;
