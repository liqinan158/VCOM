Fortunately, very few presidents have had the dishonor of being <i>impeached</i>.</p><p class="long">If you impeach a president, you charge him or her with a crime. Congress may vote to impeach a president, but being impeached is only the first step in removing an official from office. <i>Impeach</i> comes from the Latin <i>impedicare</i>, meaning "catch, entangle." To impeach also means to cast doubt on someone's character.  In a courtroom, a lawyer could impeach the credibility of a witness in order to discredit whatever that person said.</p></div></div>`;
