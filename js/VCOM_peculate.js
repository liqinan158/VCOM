To <i>peculate</i> is, of course, illegal â€” if you're caught, you can serve jail time.</p><p class="long"><i>Peculate</i> comes from the Latin word <i>peculium</i>, meaning private property, which itself has the root <i>pecu</i>, or cattle, so the literal meaning of <i>peculium</i> is "property in cattle." Cattle were considered very valuable property in ancient times, and stealing them was a grave act. Other words that have <i>pecu</i> at their roots include "peculiar" and "pecuniary." Despite the extremely similar spelling, the word "speculate" has totally different roots that have nothing to do with either cattle or embezzlement.</p></div></div>`;
