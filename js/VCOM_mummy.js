In ancient Egypt, preserving a body as a <i>mummy</i> was part of a religious belief in an afterlife.</p><p class="long">Today, some bodies are embalmed and preserved after death, but rarely with the same ceremony that preparing a mummy involved. Most mummies were wrapped in cloth and treated with chemicals, after having their internal organs removed. Many countries have ancient mummy traditions, including China, Libya, Iran, and Italy, as well as the country most famous for its mummies, Egypt. The word comes from the Arabic <i>mumiyah</i>.</p></div></div>`;
