If one person shows up to your party, well then that is an <i>abysmal</i> turnout. The 1958 Ford Edsel? An <i>abysmal</i> failure.</p><p class="long">When someone describes the hole you just dug as abysmal, you may not know whether to take it as positive or negative feedback. That's because starting in the 1650s, <i>abysmal</i> simply meant “resembling an abyss in depth.” By that definition you've just received a compliment on your deep digging skills. But since the early twentieth century, <i>abysmal</i> has been more commonly used to identify something as "extremely bad." So it's more likely that your hole has just been insulted.</p></div>`;
