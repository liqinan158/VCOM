That is what a <i>ewe</i> is.</p><p class="long">Most people have precious few opportunities to use the word <i>ewe</i>. For most of us, it's most valuable as a three-letter word for crossword puzzles. For example: 1-down:  a three-letter word meaning female sheep. Answer? <i>Ewe</i>! Also, if you're an avid Scrabble player, <i>ewe</i> is a good word to keep up your sleeve. That "W" can rake in some serious points if you put it on a triple-word space. Finally, punster's will enjoy using <i>ewe</i> in a sentence like “you and I will go see the <i>ewe</i> and him” — which has the two of us going to see some guy and his female sheep.</p></div>`;
