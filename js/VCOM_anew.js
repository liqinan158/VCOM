If a couple takes their marriage vows anew, it's a little different than the first time. If a clothes trend happens anew, it's a revival of the original trend that probably won't be identical. This word applies to renewals and fresh starts of many kinds, though not always positive ones. Romances and barfights could both begin anew.</p></div></div>`;
