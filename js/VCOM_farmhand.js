While a farmer owns or manages a farm, a farmhand is hired to take on extra jobs, sometimes either part time, temporarily, or seasonally. The word <i>hand</i> gained the meaning "person who does something with his hands" in the 16th century, and often meant "hired workman" or "ship's crew member." <i>Farmhand</i>, therefore, means "hired worker on a farm."</p></div></div>`;
