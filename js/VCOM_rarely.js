If you walk or bike to work most days, you could say that you <i>rarely</i> take the bus.</p><p class="long">Something that happens rarely happens only once in a while, or seldom. You might sigh that your town's baseball team rarely wins a game, or boast that you rarely forget a person's name once you've been introduced. The word comes from the adjective <i>rare</i>, "not occurring often," or "unusual," from the Old French <i>rere</i>, "sparse," and its root, the Latin word <i>rarus</i>, "thinly sown, with intervals between, or full of empty spaces."</p></div>`;
