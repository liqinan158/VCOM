A fairly technical word little used now, <i>maculate</i> means "spotted" or "blotchy."</p><p class="long">There's another meaning for <i>maculate,</i> that of "having a blemished or impure moral character." Now your little sister doesn't have that, does she? You can also maculate something by either physically or metaphorically polluting it â€” like a river or a relationship.</p></div>`;
