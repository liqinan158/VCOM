The best thing about summer evenings is looking for twinkling fireflies in the <i>gloaming</i>.</p><p class="long">That romantic time of day when the light has mostly faded but it's not quite dark yet? You can call that the <i>gloaming</i>. This is a word with a strong Scottish heritage, adopted from Scottish dialect during the Middle Ages and rooted in the Old English word for "twilight," <i>gl≈çm</i>. It fell out of use In English for many years, while Scots speakers continued to use it, and was re-adopted in the 1800s.</p></div>`;
