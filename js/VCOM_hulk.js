Another kind of <i>hulk</i> is a big person, like the Incredible <i>Hulk</i> who could single-handedly sink the <i>hulk</i> of any ship.</p><p class="long">Hulks were once commonly used as prisons — floating jails where convicted criminals were kept. Ships become hulks when they're retired due to age, or damaged in a storm. Another meaning of <i>hulk</i>, "enormous person," is rooted in this ship meaning, coming from the sense of either type of hulk as big, awkward, and clumsy. The Middle English source is <i>hulc</i>, "heavy, unwieldy ship," from the Greek <i>holkas</i>, "merchant ship."</p></div></div>`;
