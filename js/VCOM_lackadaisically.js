If you're rushing to get ready in the morning, you'll be frustrated when your sister is hogging the bathroom, <i>lackadaisically</i> brushing her teeth.</p><p class="long">The adverb <i>lackadaisically</i> comes from an old expression, "lack-a-day," which expressed regret or sorrow â€” sort of like saying, "woe is me" or "alas." <i>Lackadaisically</i> was originally used to mean "in a sentimentally woebegone way," but at some point <i>lax</i>, "loose or languid," started to alter the way people used the word. Today if you act lackadaisically, you're halfhearted or even lethargic. If you study lackadaisically, you're unlikely to ace your vocabulary quiz.</p></div></div>`;
