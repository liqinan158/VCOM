In Scotland, millions of acres are carpeted in colorful heather, and the country is closely associated with the plant. The Old English root of <i>heather</i> is <i>h√¶ddre</i>, and the word was mainly used in Scots until the 16th century. As a girl's name, <i>Heather</i> was extremely rare until the 1930s, and its popularity exploded in the 1970s and 80s.</p></div>`;
