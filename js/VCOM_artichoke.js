Some people like to dip their <i>artichoke</i> leaves in melted butter.</p><p class="long">The artichoke you can buy in the supermarket is called a "globe artichoke," and it's specially cultivated to be tasty. Artichokes are actually a kind of thistle, or a prickly, flowering plant. The part of an artichoke that's edible has to be picked before it blooms, or it becomes too tough to eat. The word comes from the Northern Italian <i>articiocco</i>, with its Arabic root word, <i>al-hursufa</i>.</p></div></div>`;
