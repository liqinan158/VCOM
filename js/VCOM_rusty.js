Like your bike, your German skills became <i>rusty</i>, meaning they're suffering from neglect.</p><p class="long">You can also describe yourself as <i>rusty</i>: you used to do flips on your skateboard, but you haven't practiced in a while and now you're a little <i>rusty</i>. <i>Rusty</i> can also refer to the color of rust, which is a reddish-brown â€” a <i>rusty</i>-colored dog, for instance. Anything made of iron or steel that you leave outside in the elements is likely to oxidize and become <i>rusty</i>, covered with rust.</p></div></div>`;
