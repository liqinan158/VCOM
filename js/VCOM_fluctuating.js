If something is fluctuating, it's unstable — it can swing back and forth. When the weather is fluctuating that means it can change at any moment, dumping snow on your town one minute and then producing warm weather the next. Moods, demand, morals, prices — anything that has unpredictable shifts can be described as fluctuating.</p></div>`;
