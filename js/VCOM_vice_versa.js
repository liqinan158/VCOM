This time you're doing the cooking for your mom!</p><p class="long">When you use <i>vice versa</i>, you’re indicating that the two things you’ve been talking about previously switch positions in the sentence. Instead of saying, “Penguins can’t live where flamingos live, and flamingos can’t live where penguins live,” you can just say, “Penguins can’t live where flamingos live, and <i>vice versa</i>.”</p></div></div>`;
