If you're having a big party, your mom may get you to help cook a <i>vat</i> of spaghetti sauce to feed all your hungry relatives.</p><p class="long">Here is an easy way to remember that <i>vat</i> has a short <i>a</i> sound: If you eat the whole vat, you'll probably get fat. Remember, though, that vats are not always food-related. People who make pottery, for example, keep vats of glazes in which they dip their vases and cups in order to color them. No matter what a vat contains, it's often heavy and hard to move.</p></div>`;
