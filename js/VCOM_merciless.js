You could accuse your rabbit-hunting brother of being <i>merciless</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Merciless</i> is the antonym, or opposite, of "merciful." If a person shows no mercy or pity, she is merciless. This can describe a cruelly violent person, or it can be more figurative: "The torrential rain was <i>merciless</i>, pouring down on the wedding party as they ran to take cover." The root word is <i>mercy</i>, which comes from the French <i>merci</i>, "reward, gift, or kindness."</p></div></div>`;
