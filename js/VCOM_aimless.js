You might prefer traveling with a map or GPS, while your best friend likes to drive in an aimless way, turning down dirt roads or exiting the highway impulsively. When you call a person aimless, you probably mean that he doesn't appear to have any ambition: "My brother's an <i>aimless</i> drifter." <i>Aimless</i> comes from <i>aim</i>, "purpose" or "target."</p></div>`;
