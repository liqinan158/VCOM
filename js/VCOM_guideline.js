If you want to stay healthy, you might want to follow the government's dietary guidelines. Sample guideline: go easy on the salt.</p><p class="long">In the 18th century, <i>guideline</i> referred to an actual line that you drew on fabric before cutting.  So for example, if you wanted to cut a piece of linen to make a dress, you'd draw a guideline on it first to make sure the incision would be straight.  The line guided your cut; over time, the word became a metaphor for a guide to any sort of action.</p></div></div>`;
