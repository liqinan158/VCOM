They ate an apple that God had forbidden them to eat, and there were terrible consequences. "Forbidden fruit" refers to something you want even more than you might otherwise, because you're not allowed to have it. If you know a little German, you may notice that <i>forbidden</i> sounds like its German equivalent, <i>verboten.</i></p></div>`;
