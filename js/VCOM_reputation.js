It's how people consider, or label, you â€” good or bad. The noun <i>reputation</i> can also mean "being known for having a specific skill or characteristic." For example, if you have a reputation in snow shoveling, your phone will soon be ringing off the hook with your lazy neighbors calling.</p></div>`;
