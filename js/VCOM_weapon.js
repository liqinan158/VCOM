Soldiers use <i>weapons</i> like guns and even sometimes use "<i>weapons</i> of mass destruction" — like bombs.

Some weapons are specially designed for killing or injuring, such as guns and crossbows, while in other cases an ordinary object, like a stick, can be used as a weapon. The Old English root is <i>wæpen</i>, "instrument of fighting or defense." The spelling is tricky, and most people just have to memorize the <i>ea</i> in <i>weapon</i>.</p></div>`;
