A substitute teacher who's a <i>pushover</i> is easily convinced that the class usually spends an hour watching music videos.</p><p class="long">If you're a pushover, you find it hard to deny anyone what they ask for. If your mom's a pushover, it means it's a breeze to get her to say yes when you ask for something. A babysitter who's a pushover will let the kids stay up way past their bedtime. If you think about it, the word makes sense: if you can <i>push</i> someone <i>over</i> easily, then that person can't stand up against you. Around 1900, <i>pushover</i> meant "an easy job or task," and by 1922 it also referred to people.</p></div></div>`;
