When you lost your first <i>tooth</i>, you probably put it under your pillow in the hopes that the <i>Tooth</i> Fairy would come and leave you a surprise.</p><p class="long">Teeth are as hard as bone, but they're actually made of layers of very dense tissue, with enamel on the outside. Humans lose their original set of teeth when they're children, growing new ones to replace them, while sharks grow an entirely new set every two weeks. Something is also called a <i>tooth</i> when it resembles animal teeth, like the teeth of a saw or a gear. When you fight <i>tooth and nail</i>, you fight fiercely.</p></div>`;
