For years, the British Empire had <i>dominance</i> over much of the world, ruling vast stretches of Africa, India, and Asia.</p><p class="long">In packs of animals, the males will often fight to determine dominance, i.e., who is top dog. Or top lion. This happens in classrooms too, with the teacher needing to establish dominance over unruly students.
