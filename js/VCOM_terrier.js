In <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, Dorothy's dog Toto is a terrier.</p><p class="long">Most terriers have short, muscular bodies. There is a lot of variety in the terrier group, thoughâ€”from fuzzy, 70-pound Airedale terriers to smooth-coated, 25-pound Boston terriers. Terriers were originally bred to hunt small animals like rats and foxes. <i>Terrier</i> comes from the Old French <i>chien terrier</i>, or "earth dog," a reference to the terrier's willingness to follow its prey into underground burrows if necessary.</p></div>`;
