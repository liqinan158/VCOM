It has nothing to do with those tasty little sea creatures, but they too are pretty slimy.</p><p class="long">Nine times out of ten the thing described as <i>clammy</i> is a hand or forehead, usually of someone who's pretty sick or just physically unpleasant. When Dickens' David Copperfield shakes the hand of the creepy Uriah Heep he exclaims, "But oh, what a clammy hand his was! As ghostly to the touch as to the sight!" <i>Clammy</i> can also refer to the air or atmosphere of a place, if it's particularly damp.</p></div>`;
