If you visit Tokyo or Disney World, you'll probably travel on a <i>monorail</i>.</p><p class="long">Most monorails are elevated, with trains either moving above a single track or dangling from it, suspended by a wide rail. They generally run on electricity, which flows through the track and keeps the train moving. The earliest monorails were designed in the late 1800s, and this is also when the word developed, from <i>mono</i>, "one" in Greek, and <i>rail</i>, from the Latin <i>regula</i>, "straight stick."</p></div>`;
