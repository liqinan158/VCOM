A lack of sunlight might cause retardation of your tomato plants, for example, stunting their growth. You can use <i>retardation</i> to describe other kinds of slowness or delays too, including simply a decrease in speed. In fact, the Latin root word, <i>retardare</i>, means "to make slow, delay, keep back, or hinder."</p></div></div>`;
