If you've ever felt a shock while putting on a sweater,  you have participated in electrical <i>conduction</i>.</p><p class="long">From Latin <i>conducere</i>, to bring together, <i>conduction</i> used to mean "safe passage or guidance from one place to another."    Today, it's only used to describe events in a scientific way.  In addition to heat and electricity, <i>conduction</i> can be applied to sound.  When you and your fellow prisoners tap on the pipes to plan your jailbreak, you are using sound conduction.  Good luck with that, by the way.</p></div>`;
