If you hear a "hoot" in the woods, look for an owl (But bring your flashlight; owls are nocturnal.).</p><p class="long">Owls share some similarities with hawks — both birds are predators, with very strong beaks and claws meant for grabbing mice, insects, rabbits, and even fish. One notable difference is that an owl has eyes on the front of its face, while most hawks have eyes on the sides of their heads. To compensate, owls can turn their heads as much as 270 degrees, to see what's behind them. <i>Owl</i> comes from an imitative root — a word that sounds like an owl's hoot.</p></div></div>`;
