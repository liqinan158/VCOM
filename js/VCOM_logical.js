Using a fire extinguisher to put it out a fire is a <i>logical</i> step. Trying to put it out with gasoline is not.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>logical</i> is rooted in the Greek word <i>logos</i>, which means "reason, idea, or word." So calling something logical means it's based on reason and sound ideas â€” in other words, thought out with mathematical precision and removed from emotion. Sounds strict and boring, but it's the orderliness and consistency of logic that helps you write a great argument or figure out how to solve a problem.</p></div></div>`;
