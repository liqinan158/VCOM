A tricolor vegetable <i>melange</i> makes even carrots, peas, and corn sound like gourmet cuisine. A <i>melange</i> is any combination of anything, but the word always heightens the glamour quotient.</p><p class="long">The French have a way of making simple words sound like romantic entreaties of love. Call any random assortment of things a <i>melange</i>, or as it's sometimes spelled, <i>mélange</i>, and voila, you've given it a sparkle that plain old words like <i>combination</i>, <i>mixture</i>, and <i>blend</i> just cannot convey. This word — along with a melange of other attributes, like great bread and pastries, delicious wine, and fine fashion — are all reasons why we love the French. All that accordion music? Not so much.</p></div></div>`;
