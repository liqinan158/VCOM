Nowadays, <i>exhibition</i> and <i>exhibit</i> are often used interchangeably. <i>Exhibition</i> comes from the Latin <i>ex</i>-, meaning "out," and <i>habere</i>, meaning "hold" — as objects in an exhibition are "held out," or shown, to the public. The <i>h</i> in "hold out" might help you remember to include the <i>h</i> when spelling <i>exhibition</i>.</p></div>`;
