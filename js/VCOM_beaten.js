Food can also be beaten, like the beaten egg whites you put in a cake to make it light and fluffy. In this case, they're stirred with vigor. And when a person is beaten, they're despondent or defeated: "The beaten expression on his face showed how exhausting the last tennis match had been." <i>Beaten</i> comes from <i>beat</i> and its root meaning "to strike."</p></div>`;
