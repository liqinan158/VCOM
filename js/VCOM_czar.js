Those kinds of <i>czars</i> are long gone, but we still use the word to describe people in charge of something important.</p><p class="long">Up until the early 20th century, the ruler in Russia was a man called a czar who had total power, like an emperor or dictator. In English, <i>czar</i> has hung around as a word for anyone in charge of anything. If you run a book club, you might jokingly call yourself a book czar. In the U.S. government, people in charge of large departments are often called czars â€” like the housing czar or labor czar.</p></div></div>`;
