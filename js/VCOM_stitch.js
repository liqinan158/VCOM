Every quilt, no matter how elaborate, starts with a single <i>stitch</i>.</p><p class="long">You can stitch a design on a pillow, or stitch up a hole in your jeans using stitches. Doctors sometimes stitch up patients' skin, too â€” if you cut yourself badly enough, you might need stitches. Another kind of stitch is a painful cramp in your stomach or side: "I stopped running when I got a <i>stitch</i>." If someone says, "I haven't got a <i>stitch</i> to wear," they're short on clothing. And being "in <i>stitches</i>" means laughing uncontrollably.</p></div>`;
