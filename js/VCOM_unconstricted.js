If you prefer to be <i>unconstricted</i> so that you can do cartwheels and yoga poses at a moment's notice, you probably wear leggings and t-shirts rather than tight jeans and starched button-downs.</p><p class="long">An unconstricted flock of chickens is free to roam around a yard, rather than being limited to a tiny cage. And an unconstricted party guest feels happy, relaxed, and free to dance and laugh to her heart's content. Unconstricted breathing means your breath flows freely through clear passages. <i>Unconstricted</i> is formed by adding <i>un-</i>, "not," to <i>constricted</i>, which comes from a combination of <i>con-</i>, "together," and the Latin root <i>stringere</i>, "to draw tight."</p></div></div>`;
