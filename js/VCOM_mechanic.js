If you are planning to be a <i>mechanic</i>, you have to be prepared to get your hands dirty.</p><p class="long">The most common type of mechanic works on vehicles like cars, motorcycles, tractors, or airplanes. If your car is making a strange noise, you should probably take it to a mechanic. The oldest meaning of this word was simply "laborer," or "person who works with his hands," from the Greek root <i>mekhanikos</i>, "engineer." The current sense of <i>mechanic</i> came into use along with the popularity of the automobile.</p></div>`;
