You can also call a person whose job is slaughtering farm animals a <i>butcher</i>. Because this is a fairly bloody, gory occupation, the word is also used to mean a cruel, ruthless murderer. It comes from the Old French <i>bochier</i>, "butcher," or literally, "slaughterer of goats," from <i>bouc</i>, "male goat."</p></div></div>`;
