Parents <i>sacrifice</i> time and sleep to take care of their children, while kids might <i>sacrifice</i> TV time to hang out with mom and dad.</p><p class="long">Though no longer used only in a religious context, <i>sacrifice</i> comes from the Latin <i>sacra</i> and <i>facere</i>, meaning "to perform sacred rites." If you've studied ancient cultures like the Incas, you've probably heard of "human sacrifice," where a person is killed in a sacred ceremony to please the gods. But thankfully those kinds of sacrifices don't happen anymore.</p></div>`;
