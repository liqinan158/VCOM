Cheers!</p><p class="long">Beer is a foamy, malt-flavored beverage with a relatively low alcohol content. Beer is actually the most commonly consumed alcoholic drink around the world, and it's believed to be the oldest too. Brewers make beer by fermenting a grain — usually barley or wheat — and adding hops or other flavoring agents. The word comes from the Old English <i>beor</i>, and though experts disagree about its roots, one guess names the Vulgar Latin <i>biber</i>, "beverage," as a possible origin.</p></div>`;
