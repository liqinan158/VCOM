When you gaze at yourself in a <i>mirror</i>, your own face gazes right back at you.</p><p class="long">"<i>Mirror, mirror</i> on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?" asks the evil queen in "Snow White," as she admires her reflection. Ordinary mirrors can't answer this question, but they can show you how you look in your new hat or whether you have spinach between your teeth. And the verb <i>mirror</i> means "reflect," as when the surface of a lake mirrors the sky.</p></div></div>`;
