A bank will help you <i>amortize</i> a loan so that you can make a monthly payment until you've paid back the entire amount.</p><p class="long">A simple way to understand the verb <i>amortize</i> is "make monthly payments on a debt." More specifically, to amortize is to pay down the total amount of the loan a little bit at a time, rather than only covering fees or interest on top of the loan amount. Someone whose bank amortizes their car loan makes a payment each month, gradually reducing the total amount they owe. <i>Amortize</i> stems from a Vulgar Latin word meaning "extinguish."</p></div></div>`;
