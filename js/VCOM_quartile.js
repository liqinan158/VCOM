You might, for example, hear about a successful school that's in the upper <i>quartile</i> of state test scores.</p><p class="long">People studying information about how people live — how much money they make, how healthy they are, how much they travel, what their ages are, what TV shows they watch — often separate them into groups for comparison. It's sometimes easier to examine statistics and information when it's divided into quartiles, or fourths. The original use of the word <i>quartile</i> was in astronomy, to mean "ninety degrees apart," from the Latin root word <i>quartus</i>, "fourth."</p></div>`;
