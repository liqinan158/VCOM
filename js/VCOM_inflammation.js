Maybe it's a political movement that suddenly takes hold, romantic feelings, the heat making your shoes feel tight, or someone lighting a campfire.</p><p class="long"><i>Inflammation</i> comes from the root <i>inflame,</i> from the Latin word <i>inflammare</i> meaning "to set on fire with passion." That meaning sounds pretty good, but an inflammation on your face, like a terrible rash, probably isn't going to inflame anyone's passion, at least until the swelling goes down. It probably also causes pain and discomfort.</p></div>`;
