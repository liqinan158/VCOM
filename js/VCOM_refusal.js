There's a stubborn quality to the word <i>refusal</i>, like a defiant child who won't be swayed. There is a legal term called the "right of first <i>refusal</i>," which gives a person an opportunity to buy or do something first, before anyone else has a chance, or to refuse the opportunity. The Latin root word is <i>refundere</i>, "pour back or give back."</p></div></div>`;
