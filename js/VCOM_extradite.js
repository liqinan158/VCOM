Treaties between countries often require them to <i>extradite</i> suspected criminals.</p><p class="long">You might hear about a criminal attempting to hide in one country, only to have its government extradite him back to the place where he committed the crime. While individual countries sometimes resist the pressure to extradite suspects, treaties between countries often encourage them to do so. The verb <i>extradite</i> comes from its noun form, <i>extradition</i>, which was likely invented by Voltaire from a combination of the Latin <i>ex</i>, "out," and <i>traditionem</i>, "a delivering up or handing over."</p></div></div>`;
