An example of a <i>zeugma</i> is, “She broke his car and his heart.”</p><p class="long">When you use one word to link two thoughts, you're using a zeugma. Some literary experts distinguish a zeugma from a syllepsis by insisting that in a zeugma, only one of the two thoughts should make literal or grammatical sense. For example, you could use the zeugma, "I lost my keys and my temper." In Greek, <i>zeugma</i> means "a yoking," as in yoking one word to two ideas.</p></div>`;
