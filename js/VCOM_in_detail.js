You might describe your Disney World vacation to your coworkers <i>in detail</i>, for example, including every single ride, all your meals, and the fight you and your sister had.</p><p class="long">Use the adverbial phrase <i>in detail</i> when something is explained or described fully, leaving out no fine points. A good clothing catalog describes items in detail, and a sharp photograph can show a person's features in detail. Newspaper articles explain current events in detail, including every particular that a reader might want to know. The simplest way to think about something done <i>in detail</i> is that it covers all the details.</p></div></div>`;
