If your dog start barking wildly while you're trying to write a complicated essay,  you might lose your <i>train of thought</i>.</p><p class="long">You can also use terms like "chain of thought" or "line of reasoning." Your train of thought can be as complicated as the series of ideas that lead to a specific conclusion, or as simple as the successive thoughts that happen to flit through your head. The first recorded use of <i>train of thought</i> was in 1651, in "Leviathan" by Thomas Hobbes, from the sense of <i>train</i> meaning "series or progression."</p></div>`;
