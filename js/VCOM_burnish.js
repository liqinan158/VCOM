It's called a <i>burnish,</i> a gloss only achieved by loads of polishing. Likewise, you can <i>burnish</i> a resume by polishing it until it's perfect.</p><p class="long">A caution about usage: <i>burnish</i> in the physical sense is usually reserved for inanimate objects, not people â€” you usually wouldn't say that someone's appearance is "burnished to perfection" or that your freshly scrubbed face is burnished. But you could burnish a car, a suit of armor, or a copper kettle. Reputations are among the most common non-physical things to be burnished.</p></div></div>`;
