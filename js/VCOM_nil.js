In the U.S. you might hear a tennis score include the word <i>nil</i>, while in the U.K. it's a common term for cricket and football scores as well. There's also a common British medical usage, "<i>nil</i> by mouth," a doctor's instruction not to eat or drink before surgery. <i>Nil</i> is a contraction of the Latin word for "nothing," <i>nihil</i>.</p></div></div>`;
