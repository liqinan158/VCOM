You might practice some <i>funky</i> bass lines before auditioning for your school's jazz band.</p><p class="long">Funky tunes have some of the spirit of the 1960s-era music genre called <i>funk</i>, a branch of R&amp;B that's influenced by soul and jazz music. Rhythm is so important in funky music that the drums and bass are emphasized, melody less so. Based on this cool music, <i>funky</i> also means "stylish" or "hip:" "Mom, those pants are totally <i>funky</i>." The word's original meaning, however, was "stinky," specifically when discussing the smell of aged cheese.</p></div></div>`;
