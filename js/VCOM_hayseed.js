You might be tempted to call your farmer cousin a <i>hayseed</i>, but it would probably hurt her feelings.</p><p class="long">The derogatory term <i>hayseed</i> is aimed at rural folks who aren't particularly urbane or savvy â€” it's a stereotype of someone who's comfortable in the country being awkward, bumbling, and unsophisticated, especially when visiting a city. This US slang comes from the common 19th century saying that country people "have <i>hayseed</i> in their hair."</p></div></div>`;
