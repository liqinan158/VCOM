The word means to despise or also to curse.</p><p class="long">Broken down to its Latin root, the word <i>execrate</i> means the opposite of being sacred or devoted to. When you execrate something, you are cursing it instead of making it holy. The word is not used all that often. If you say to someone, "I <i>execrate</i> you!" they might think you're casting an evil spell on them. Which in a way, by cursing them, you are.</p></div>`;
