The word descended from the Greek <i>hierogluphikos</i> which could be translated to mean "sacred carvings." Back when written communication was literally carved in stone, most of what was written was important, or "sacred." Today if someone describes your handwriting as hieroglyphic, they mean something quite different - your writing is awful and illegible.</p></div></div>`;
