var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">mitten</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>mitten</i> is a cold-weather piece of clothing that you wear on your hand. Unlike gloves, which cover each finger individually, <i>mittens</i> cover your four fingers together, and your thumb separately.</p><p class="long">Mittens keep your hands warmer than gloves, because your fingers share their warmth and expose less surface area to the cold. Small children often wear mittens â€” they're easier to put on than gloves are, and it's common for them to be attached to each other with yarn that can be threaded through the arms of a coat, or clipped onto a coat's sleeves. The word <i>mitten</i> comes from <i>medietana</i>, "divided in the middle" in Vulgar Latin.</p></div>`;
