Some people have ugly Christmas <i>sweater</i> contests—and if you wear your neon green reindeer <i>sweater</i> covered with pom-poms, you just might win!</p><p class="long">In Britain it's a <i>jumper</i>, but in most of North America, it's a <i>sweater</i>. You put on a sweater either by pulling it over your head (if it's a pullover), or by putting your arms in the sleeves and shrugging it onto your shoulders (if it's a cardigan). As you might have guessed, <i>sweater</i> comes from <i>sweat</i>—the earliest sweaters were worn by rowers, and were intended "to produce sweating and reduce weight."</p></div>`;
