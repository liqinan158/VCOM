Another very common meaning of <i>constitution</i> is the physical makeup of a person.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>constitution</i> is from Latin, from <i>constitutus</i>, "set up, established," plus the suffix <i>-ion</i>, meaning "act, state, or condition." So think of a constitution as how a body (yours, the government's) is set up. If you have a strong constitution, it means you don't get sick very often.</p></div></div>`;
