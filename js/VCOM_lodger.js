If you rent out a room in your house, guess what? You'll have a <i>lodger</i> living with you.</p><p class="long">As opposed to a renter, who rents an entire apartment or house, a lodger generally leases only a bedroom, sharing the use of the kitchen and bathroom with the house's other inhabitants. You could also call a lodger a "roomer" or a "boarder." <i>Lodger</i> comes from <i>lodge</i>, "small house," from the Old French <i>loge</i>, "hut or cabin."</p></div></div>`;
