Like a bull that won’t budge, <i>obstinance</i> keeps people from going with the flow. If everybody wants to watch a movie you dislike, don’t let your <i>obstinance</i> ruin family movie night.</p><p class="long">When someone is obstinate, they are strong-willed and determined, so you can use the word <i>obstinance</i> to describe this quality. There’s the obstinance of a two-year old who refuses to go to bed, or the obstinance of someone who believes that aliens built the pyramids and can’t be convinced otherwise. The Latin root of <i>obstinance</i> is <i>obstinare</i>, "stand stubbornly."</p></div></div>`;
