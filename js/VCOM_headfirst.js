For example, a boy might show off by diving <i>headfirst</i> into a chilly lake.</p><p class="long">The adverb <i>headfirst</i> is useful for describing a dive or a movement that leads with the head. A stormy ocean might fling a swimmer headfirst onto the beach, or an unlucky skier could slide headfirst down a mountain. You can also use <i>headfirst</i> in a more figurative way, to describe something that's done impulsively, or in a foolishly hasty manner: "He plunged <i>headfirst</i> into this new relationship two days after breaking up with his girlfriend."</p></div>`;
