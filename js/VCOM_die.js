To <i>die</i> is to expire, or to cease to be alive.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>to die</i> means "to stop living," and it's also used to exaggerate a need or want, like when you say, "I would <i>die</i> to have those shoes." When <i>die</i> is a noun, it means a metal-cutting tool or the single form of <i>dice</i>: "Hand me the <i>die</i>, it's my turn to roll." When you're talking about permanently staining or coloring something, you have to use the word <i>dye</i>.</p></div>`;
