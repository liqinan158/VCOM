"<i>Homo</i> sapiens" are modern humans. Our ancestors had names like "<i>Homo</i> neanderthalensis" and "<i>Homo</i> erectus."</p><p class="long"><i>Homo</i> is a Latin word that means man, or human. When it is used as a prefix, as in "homosexual," it comes from the Greek word <i>homos</i>, meaning the same. It is from the word "homosexual" that the noun <i>homo</i> is shortened and takes its second meaning â€” a derogatory term for a homosexual or gay man. Its use is offensive, and you should use other terms instead. It is spelled with a lowercase <i>h</i> in this use.</p></div>`;
