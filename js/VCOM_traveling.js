People love to go <i>traveling</i> to see new places and experience different cultures. When people are <i>traveling</i>, they’re not just running around the block; they're on a journey.</p><p class="long"><i>Traveling</i> comes from the Old French word <i>travil</i>, meaning “suffering or painful effort” or  “trouble” as in traveling a long distance in a covered wagon. But remember, that was back before airplanes, G.P.S. units, and suitcases with wheels. Any kind of traveling has a destination, whether you're headed to a resort or a business meeting in a different city. Lots of people enjoy traveling in the summer when there’s no school. Woohoo!</p></div></div>`;
