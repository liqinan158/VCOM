It can also mean cheerful, like your <i>sunny</i>, upbeat best friend.</p><p class="long">When the sun is shining, it's a sunny day, and when you're smiling and friendly, you're sunny too. <i>Sunny</i> has been used in this figurative way since the 16th century, and in the 1830s, <i>sunny side</i> came to mean "optimistic outlook." However, if you order your eggs sunny side up, it just means you'll get two fried eggs with bright yellow, runny yolks.</p></div>`;
