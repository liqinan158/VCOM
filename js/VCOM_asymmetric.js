var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">asymmetric</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">You describe something as <i>asymmetric</i> when it lacks the mirror-image quality of symmetry. That dress your sister sewed for you may appear stylishly <i>asymmetric</i>, but really the reason the sleeves are different lengths is because she doesnâ€™t know how to use a tape measure.</p><p class="long">The <i>a-</i> prefix comes from Latin and makes a word into its opposite, so <i>asymmetric</i> is the opposite of <i>symmetric</i>. <i>Asymmetric</i> often describes an intentional part of a design, like a shirt with an asymmetric neckline. But it can also describe something that is the result of a mistake, injustice, or deformity, like asymmetric growth in a body, which may be a sign of disease.</p></div></div>`;
