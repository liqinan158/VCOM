The word originated with sea vessels whose right side was used for steering. Since the stars helped sailors determine direction, this part of the ship became known as the starboard. You can also use <i>starboard</i> as an adjective for anything on the right side of a ship. If you ever ride on a boat, you could probably impress the captain by talking about equipment on the starboard side.</p></div></div>`;
