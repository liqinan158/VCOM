Your poodle and your bulldog are the same <i>species</i>, but your hamster and your goldfish are not.</p><p class="long">All members of the same species have similar genes and can interbreed and produce offspring. A <i>subspecies</i> is a division of a species, and a <i>genus</i> includes several different species. Biologists use these categories to classify organisms, usually with Latin names like <i>Canis familiaris</i>, or "domestic dog." In Middle English, <i>species</i> meant "a classification in logic," borrowed from the Latin word meaning "kind or appearance," from the root of <i>specere</i>, "to see."</p></div></div>`;
