You'll have to be careful when you're wearing your <i>toupee</i> on a windy day!</p><p class="long">It's easy to joke about toupees, since they often seem to quite obviously be covering up bald spots â€” especially if the toupee is a slightly different color from the remainder of the wearer's real hair. The noun <i>toupee</i> comes from the French word <i>toupet</i>, "tuft of hair." Originally, a toupee was a decorative tuft of fake hair that was worn for the style, rather than to cover up baldness.</p></div></div>`;
