You might <i>rephrase</i> your question if the person you're asking doesn't understand it the first time.</p><p class="long">You might want to rephrase something to clarify a statement, adjust your ideas to fit your audience, or try not to offend the person you're talking to. A salesman might rephrase his pitch if he's not having much success selling encyclopedias, and an author might rephrase material from a book so that the kindergartners she's talking to will understand her. The word combines the prefix <i>re-</i>, "again," and <i>phrase</i>, from the Greek <i>phrasis</i>, or "speech."</p></div></div>`;
