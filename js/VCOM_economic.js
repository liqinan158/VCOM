And the <i>economy</i>? It's all about money, honey.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>economic</i>, meaning “pertaining to management of a household,” first developed in the 1590’s and might remind you of "Home Economics" classes where you once learned to cook and sew. Usually though, we use <i>economic</i> to describe things relating to finance. It’s not the same as <i>financial</i>, but if you’re talking about a town or country whose finances are in dire straits, it’s ok to say "<i>economic</i> ruin."</p></div></div>`;
