Manufacturers use metal <i>gussets</i> to reinforce joists or join metal plates together.</p><p class="long">Most gussets are shaped like triangles. Some <i>gussets</i> make clothing sturdier, and some make it wider or shape it more accurately to the body. They might be added along the sides of a shirt, under the arms, or at the spot where inside leg seams meet in a pair of pants or tights. The original gussets were used in chain mail or armor, to cover unprotected areas. The word comes from the Old French <i>gosset</i>, "armhole," or "piece of armor for the armpit."</p></div>`;
