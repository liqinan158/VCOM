Your <i>loathing</i> of the feeling of sand between your toes means that going to the beach isn't much fun for you.</p><p class="long">If you have an utterly disgusted hatred of something, you have a loathing for it. A loathing of green vegetables can result in nutritional problems, and a loathing of little kids would make a person a pretty terrible babysitter. To <i>loathe</i> something is to abhor or strongly dislike it; the Old English root of both <i>loathe</i> and <i>loathing</i> is <i>la√∞ian</i>, to be disgusted with.</p></div></div>`;
