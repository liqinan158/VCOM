A  decision, plan, or policy is like an empty idea until it's implemented. An implemented rule, on the other hand, is in full force, and you'll have to stick to it. When a law has been suggested, officially proposed, voted on, and finally written into the law books, you can describe it as <i>implemented</i>.</p></div>`;
