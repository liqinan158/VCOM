To <i>disappear</i> is to vanish, evaporate, or just fade away.</p><p class="long">The word <i>disappear</i> is made up of <i>dis</i>, meaning "do the opposite of" and <i>appear</i>. So to disappear is to do the opposite of appear. Magicians are experts at making things disappear: one minute the rabbit is here, and the next, it's gone! When you lose something, like one of a pair of socks, you could say it disappeared. Snow disappears as it melts; boiling water disappears as it evaporates. Anything that goes away without leaving a trace has disappeared.</p></div></div>`;
