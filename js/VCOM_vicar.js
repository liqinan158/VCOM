Originally considered an earthly go-between for man and God, the meaning of the word moved diminished as the vicar became sort of a "deputy" priest or parson. You can find a vicar in the Church of England, and also in the Episcopal and Roman Catholic churches. Consider that "vicarious" means something taking another's place â€” that's what a vicar does.</p></div>`;
