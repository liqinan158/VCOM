Be careful when you're the <i>intermediary</i> between two friends who are fighting, because they might both end up mad at you!</p><p class="long">The word <i>intermediary</i> comes from the Latin <i>intermedius</i>, which is also the root word for <i>intermediate</i>. <i>Inter-</i> means between, and <i>medius</i> means the middle â€” <i>intermediary</i> retains that sense of being in the middle. Intermediaries are used to negotiate between two countries who are at odds, between a company and a client over a contract, between two bickering children, or between a boss and an employee in salary negotiations.</p></div></div>`;
