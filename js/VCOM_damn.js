In one sense it means to condemn or send someone to hell, as in "God <i>damn</i> it!" Other times it means "a little amount," as in "I don't give a <i>damn</i> about baseball."</p><p class="long">People can give a damn, damn others to hell, and complain about the damn weather. Some religious people believe their sins could damn them to an eternity of torment and hellfire. You should be careful when peppering your speech with <i>damn</i>, as it might offend some ears. But sometimes <i>damn</i> can be used positively, as in "They make the best damn pizza in town!"</p></div>`;
