A summary will give a few key details and then the narrative will delve into the details. "I hate to interrupt your narrative," is a polite way of stopping someone in the middle of a story. The origin of this noun is the Latin adjective <i>narrativus,</i> from <i>narrare </i>"to tell," from <i>gnarus</i> "knowing." It is related to our English verb <i>know</i>.</p></div>`;
