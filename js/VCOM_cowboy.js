If you visit a ranch, you may get to watch <i>cowboys</i> doing tricks with lassos.</p><p class="long">Cowboys work hard caring for herds of cattle, and they are experts at doing their jobs on horseback. Many cowboys also perform in rodeos, either for money or just for fun. A cowboy is traditionally male, and while there are women who do the same work on ranches, they're typically called <i>cowgirls</i>. The word <i>cowboy</i> dates from the early 1800s in the Western United States â€” sometimes these ranch workers were called <i>cowhands</i> or <i>cowpokes</i>.</p></div>`;
