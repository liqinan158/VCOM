If you spend too much time staring at screens, you might want to <i>dissever</i> yourself from technology and go camping this weekend.</p><p class="long">These days, the verb <i>dissever</i> is considered old-fashioned or primarily literary â€” you're more likely to use words like <i>sever</i> or <i>detach</i>. It can be useful if you need a more poetic way to talk about dividing things, though: "Don't go to Maine for the summer; I can't bear to dissever my heart from yours!" <i>Dissever</i> comes from a Latin root, <i>separare</i>, "to pull apart."</p></div></div>`;
