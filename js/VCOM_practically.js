It also means done in a practical way – if you wear sneakers on a long walk, you’re dressed <i>practically</i>.</p><p class="long">There are two main senses of <i>practically</i>. If you have practically no free time, you have nearly no free time. If your hair is practically blonde, it is almost blonde. Also, this word can refer to the sense of <i>practical</i> as sensible and realistic. A smart worker will know how to get the job done practically (efficiently). A smart investor will invest money practically (wisely). Doing things practically is the opposite of being reckless and unrealistic.</p></div>`;
