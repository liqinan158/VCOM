Instead, it means not paying attention to details, like friends who are so busy studying for a test that they only give your new haircut a <i>cursory</i> glance.</p><p class="long"><i>Cursory</i> dates to the early 17th century, from the French word <i>cursoire</i> meaning "rapid," which comes from the Latin word <i>cursorius</i>, meaning "hasty, of a race or running." Something that is cursory is done quickly. A teacher might take a cursory look at a pile of completed tests, not to grade them, but to see if anyone attempted the bonus questions.</p></div>`;
