So no food fights.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>militancy</i> comes from <i>militant</i>, "combative, violent, or confrontational," which we can trace back to the Latin <i>miles</i>, or "soldier." When soldiers employ militancy, it makes sense, since they are members of the <i>military</i>, which is all about aggression and combat. Seeing militancy in schools or on city streets is a lot more alarming to most people.</p></div></div>`;
