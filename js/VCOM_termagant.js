A termagant is like a shrew (another old-fashioned term). Termagants are always in a bad mood, whining and complaining, and generally making life miserable for everyone around them. You might also see <i>termagant</i> used as an adjective, as in "that <i>termagant</i> wife of yours is trouble." The noun <i>termagant</i> comes from a made-up violent god that frequently appeared in European medieval literature.</p></div>`;
