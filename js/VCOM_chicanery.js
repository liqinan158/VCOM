This tricky kind of deceit and manipulation is called <i>chicanery</i>.</p><p class="long">Besides <i>chicanery</i>, another funny-sounding word for trickery is <i>shenanigans</i>. Whereas the former is always used in the singular and involves deceptive language, the latter is usually used in the plural and refers to the actions of a person. Your crazy neighbor is up to his old shenanigans if he has begun doing weird stuff again, but if a politician's chicanery is exposed, he will lose public trust and not be returned to office in the next election cycle.</p></div>`;
