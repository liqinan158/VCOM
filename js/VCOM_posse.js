In a classic Western movie, when the sheriff gathers together a <i>posse</i>, its members usually work to find and arrest the bad guys.</p><p class="long">The classic image of a posse is from the Old West, of a group of armed cowboys on horses, in pursuit of an outlaw. Originally the term was <i>posse comitatus</i>, Latin meaning the force of the country. Today, the word <i>posse</i> is used most often to refer to a group of friends or people with some common interest, in a somewhat joking way, like your posse that gets together to hit all the garage sales together.</p></div>`;
