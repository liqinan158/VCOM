While <i>gazpacho</i> comes from Spain, it's common to find the refreshing dish on restaurant menus in the United States, especially during the summer.</p><p class="long">Today most gazpacho contains pureed vegetables—usually tomatoes but also cucumbers and sweet peppers—but the original recipe began with stale bread soaked in water. The name <i>gazpacho</i> is a bit of a mystery, though some experts think it may be related to the Mozarab word <i>caspa</i>, or "fragments," or possibly the Hebrew <i>gazaz</i>, "break into pieces."</p></div>`;
