If you've ever had to sit by yourself in a school cafeteria, you know what <i>estrangement</i> feels like.</p><p class="long">Right in the middle of the word <i>estrangement</i> is <i>strange</i>, and it provides a great clue about how to use the word. Estrangement happens when something — or someone — makes you feel like a stranger. It can describe a couple that's split up or the alienation of a former friend. The meaning hasn't changed much from its Latin root, <i>extraneare</i>, "treat as a stranger."</p></div></div>`;
