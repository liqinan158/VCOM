This means you devise a scheme to do that person harm. <i>Conspire</i> also can be used in a more figurative sense to describe events that cause problems, like bad weather that may conspire against your picnic plans, or a series of injuries that conspire against a basketball team struggling to make the playoffs.</p></div>`;
