In other words, back-breakingly hard mental exertion or physical labor.</p><p class="long"><i>Travail</i> comes to us from a sinister Latin word: <i>trepalium</i>, meaning “instrument of torture.” The closest English word is probably <i>toil</i>, though <i>travail</i> means you’re not just exerting monumental effort but suffering as you do so. If your life has been hard-knock enough to be the stuff of old blues songs or Shakespearean tragedies, you’ve had your share of travails. In French, incidentally, <i>travail</i> simply means "work." The Spanish <i>trabajo</i>, "work," is closely related.</p></div></div>`;
