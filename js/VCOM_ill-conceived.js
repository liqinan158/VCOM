Ill-conceived laws tend to have unfortunate effects that lawmakers didn't expect, and ill-conceived movie scripts result in films whose plots make no logical sense. Something that's <i>conceived</i> is thought of, planned, or imagined, and when you add the prefix <i>ill</i>, you get something that's planned badly.</p></div></div>`;
