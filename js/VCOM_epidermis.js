Don't panic: <i>epidermis</i> is just a fancy word for skin.</p><p class="long">The word <i>epidermis</i> comes from the Greek roots <i>epi</i> meaning "upon" and <i>derma</i>, which means "skin," a pretty apt translation, since epidermis is the outer layer of cell on the surface of an organism, in short â€” "the skin." Our epidermis is our main protection from the dangers of the outside world. It's thinnest on the eyelids and thickest on the palms of our hands.</p></div>`;
