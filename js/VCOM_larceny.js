Grand <i>larceny</i> is when you take something worth a lot of money, petty <i>larceny</i> when the stolen item is worth relatively little.</p><p class="long"><i>Larceny</i> is used when talking about stealing someone's property in regards to the law. If you illegally download music or plagiarize a text, that may be theft, but it is not larceny because there was no physical property involved. If you take a friend's yoyo and don't give it back, it's stealing â€” unless your friend calls the police and has you arrested on charges of larceny.</p></div>`;
