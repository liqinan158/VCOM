All the grocery stores in your neighborhood might form a <i>consortium</i> for the promotion of local strawberries.</p><p class="long"><i>Consortium</i> comes from the verb <i>consort</i>, which means "to accompany or associate." <i>Consortium</i> used to mean "fellowship, participation, society," but these days you're more likely to hear <i>consortium</i> for an association of different institutions like schools or companies than, say, a consortium of philosophical frog lovers. Still, consortiums usually preserve the ideals of fellowship, with every member institution chipping in to reach a common goal.</p></div>`;
