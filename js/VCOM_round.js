When you use <i>round</i> as a verb, it means to form something into a circular or spherical shape: "Round the dough and then press it into the pan." In math, <i>round</i> means to go up or down to the nearest whole number: "Round the bill up before you figure out how much to tip your server." The Latin root, <i>rotundus</i>, means "like a wheel."</p></div></div>`;
