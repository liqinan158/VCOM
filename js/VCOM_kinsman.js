Even if you don't know your second cousin very well, he's still your <i>kinsman</i>.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>kinsman</i> can refer to any blood relation or ancestor, especially those who are male. You can also use <i>kinswoman</i> to talk about female relatives. The word is a formal one that you might come across in an anthropology textbook or a family history: "The first <i>kinsman</i> to leave England came on the Mayflower." <i>Kinsman</i> comes in part from <i>kin</i>, with its Old English root <i>cynn</i>, or "family."</p></div>`;
