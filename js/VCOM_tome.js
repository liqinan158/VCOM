If you're pre-med, chances are you're going to have one heck of a <i>tome</i> for your biology class. <i>Tome</i> is often used to refer to a book that is not only really large but also unusually important.</p><p class="long">If you generally carry more than one <i>tome</i> to class, invest in a bag with wheels so you don't hurt your back. A tome is big and heavy. "Wow! This tome weighs a ton!" Whatever you do, don't leave your tome at homeâ€”you'll wind up in detention! You can also use <i>tome</i> sarcastically to describe a book that clearly isn't large or important. But sarcasm is for advanced users only.</p></div>`;
