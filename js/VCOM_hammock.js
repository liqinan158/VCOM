You might enjoy reading a book while lying in a <i>hammock</i> under a shady tree.</p><p class="long">Most people use hammocks to nap or relax, rather than sleeping in them all night, and many kids enjoy swinging back and forth in a hammock. In some cultures and special situations, hammocks have been used for regular sleeping â€” for example, hammocks were once commonly found on ships, providing sailors with easily portable beds. <i>Hammock</i> comes from the Spanish <i>hamaca</i>, a variation on the Taino <i>hamaka</i>, "fish nets."</p></div></div>`;
