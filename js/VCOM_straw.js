People make baskets, hats, bedding, fuel, and much more from <i>straw</i>. But not drinking <i>straws</i> â€”those are usually plastic.</p><p class="long">Many farm animals have sleeping areas lined with straw. This stiff, dry fiber is also added to animal feed, pressed into bricks that can be burned as fuel, and even made into bales that can comprise the walls of a home. Straw is what's left over when the grain and chaff have been removed from cereal plants like wheat. The Old English <i>streaw</i> literally means "that which is scattered or strewn." As a color, <i>straw</i> is light yellowish beige.</p></div>`;
