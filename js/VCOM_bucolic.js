If your parents wanted to raise you in a <i>bucolic</i> environment, you may find yourself living 45 minutes away from the nearest movie theater or person your age. Not ideal.</p><p class="long">You wouldn’t know it to look at it, but <i>bucolic</i> is a distant relation of <i>cow,</i> and all <i>bucolic</i>’s meanings can be connected to the bovine creature. <i>Bucolic</i> ultimately comes from the Greek <i>boukolos,</i> <i>cowherd</i> or <i>herdsman.</i> A bucolic could be a short poem about pastoral (cow) life or a country person, who is stereotyped as a cowherd. Used as an adjective, bucolic can refer to an idealized rural life (think life with cows) or to herdsmen (more cows). And that’s no bull.</p></div>`;
