var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">mangled</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Something that's <i>mangled</i> is damaged or even ruined from being crushed, torn, or sliced. Your recycling bin will be full of <i>mangled</i> soda cans if you stomp on them with your work boots before tossing them in.</p><p class="long">Cars can be mangled after a bad accident, and even buildings might be mangled after an explosion. Mangled debris may mark the site of a bomb or plane crash. You can also use this adjective figuratively, to mean "ruined," like when you perform a mangled rendition of your favorite song at the school talent show. <i>Mangled</i> comes from the Old French <i>mangoner</i>, "cut to pieces."</p></div>`;
