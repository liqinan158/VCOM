It's an uncommon word for an uncommon condition, the adoration of language and the words and rules that comprise it. The roots of <i>verbolatry</i> combine the Latin word <i>verbum</i>, which means "word," and the suffix <i>-latry</i>, which means "worship of" and comes from the Greek <i>latreia</i>, "service paid to the gods." If you worship at the church of grammar, you've got a full-fledged case of verbolatry.</p></div></div>`;
