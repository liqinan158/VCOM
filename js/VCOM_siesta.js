In some countries, it's common for people to take a <i>siesta</i> after lunch.</p><p class="long">In warm parts of Southern Europe and the Mediterranean, the siesta is an important part of the culture. It's especially ingrained in Spainâ€”and in Italy, where it's called a <i>riposo</i>. The Spanish word <i>siesta</i>, "mid-day nap," comes from the Latin phrase <i>sexta hora</i>, "sixth hour," or noon. The prevalence of siestas in certain countries is probably connected to hot weather and traditions of large mid-day meals.</p></div>`;
