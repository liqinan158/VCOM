The difference between raptors and other birds that also eat animals (like gulls, for example) is that raptors use not only their beaks, but also their curved  talons to catch their prey. Before it came to be used for these birds, <i>raptor</i> meant "abductor," from its Latin meaning, "robber, plunderer, or abductor," from <i>rapere</i>, "to seize."</p></div></div>`;
