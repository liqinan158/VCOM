In many cases, other countries, such as the US, try to influence such governments to make this change: they democratize them, in other words. The word <i>democratize</i> comes from the Greek root <i>demokratia</i>, "popular government," from <i>demos</i>, "common people," and <i>kratos</i>, "rule."</p></div>`;
