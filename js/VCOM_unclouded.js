You can also use it for anything that's clear, rather than murky: "The lake was unclouded â€” you could see right down to the bottom." And the absence of gloom or darkness in a situation is yet another way to be unclouded: "Their lives were happy, unclouded by their neighbors' feuding."</p></div>`;
