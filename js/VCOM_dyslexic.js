Many think that dyslexic people simply transpose letters and numbers — reading 1234 as 4321 or mistaking <i>b</i> for <i>d</i> — but the symptoms are usually broader than this. To a dyslexic person, letters and numbers may jump around on the page, or the person might have trouble connecting letters to the sounds they make. The word <i>dyslexic</i> comes from the Greek roots <i>dys</i>, meaning bad, and <i>lexis</i>, meaning word.</p></div></div>`;
