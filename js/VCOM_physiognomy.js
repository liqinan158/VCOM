When traveling in Italy, you may be struck by the pleasing <i>physiognomy</i> of the marble statues sculpted during the Renaissance.</p><p class="long">The reason <i>physiognomy</i> sounds like it should be something you study in school right after biology, geometry, and astronomy is that people used to think that it was a science by which you could tell someone's character through their facial features. If you've ever read any Nancy Drew stories, you will know how this plays out â€” anyone with "shifty eyes" is not to be trusted.</p></div></div>`;
