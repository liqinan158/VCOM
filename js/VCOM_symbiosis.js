The prefix <i>syn</i> comes from the Greek word "together" and <i>bios</i> means "life." So <i>symbiosis</i> means "a living together." Things that live in symbiosis depend on one another, like the clown fish and anemone that protect one another from ocean predators, or the symbiosis between a dairy farmer and one who grows hay, trading milk for hay bales that feed the cows.</p></div>`;
