Either that or you’re asleep and dreaming. Things that are <i>surreal</i> combine unrelated elements to create a bizarre scene.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>surreal</i> comes from <i>Surrealism</i>, a movement that produced films, writing, painting, and other art forms that often contained irrational, disjointed images. So, <i>surreal</i> describes something that’s a bizarre mix of elements, often jarring and seemingly nonsensical. Images can be surreal, like the melting clocks in Salvador Dali's paintings, but so can strange, dream-like moments in everyday life.</p></div>`;
