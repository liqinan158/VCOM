If you are, then you do as you're told, out of a feeling of duty and obligation. Dutiful children know this means cleaning one's room, taking out the trash, and not talking back!</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>dutiful</i> is often used to describe obedient children, servants, and soldiers, as well as anyone else who willingly obeys orders. Not surprisingly, <i>dutiful</i> can also have a somewhat negative meaning. For example, if your graduation speaker gives a painfully boring address, you may respond with "<i>dutiful</i> applause" when it's over. That means you are clapping out of a sense of duty and respect, not because you thought the speech was any good.</p></div>`;
