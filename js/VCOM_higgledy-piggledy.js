var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">higgledy-piggledy</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When something happens <i>higgledy-piggledy</i>, it's chaotic and disorganized. If you build your Lego tower <i>higgledy-piggledy</i>, it may end up too tall and narrow, making it that much easier for you brother to knock it over.</p><p class="long">You can use this word, known as a "reduplicated phrase" for the rhyming repetition of its sounds, as an adjective and an adverb. So your dad may object to the higgledy-piggledy state of your room, and you might respond by throwing everything higgledy-piggledy into your closet. It's a great word that perfectly illustrates disorder or confusion. Unlike other reduplicated phrases such as <i>hanky-panky</i> or <i>helter-skelter</i>, <i>higgledy-piggledy</i> is a rare double dactyl, a repeated three-syllable word that stresses the first syllable.</p></div>`;
