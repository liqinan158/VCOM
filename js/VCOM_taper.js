Part of the power of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is how the two walls appear to <i>taper</i> off into infinity.</p><p class="long">As a verb, <i>taper</i> can refer not just to physical objects that narrow: the weather forecast might call for heavy snow that will taper off at the end of the day, and public interest in a political scandal might taper off over time.  As a noun, <i>taper</i> refers to a shape that narrows at one end, and it's also another word for a candle that is smaller at one end than the other. "Narrow candle" is the original meaning of the word, and it seems to derive from the Latin <i>papyrus</i>, which was once used to make candle wicks.</p></div></div>`;
