If you hope to <i>live</i> until you're 100, start eating vegetables.</p><p class="long">When <i>live</i> rhymes with <i>give</i>, it's a verb that has to do with existing â€” being or staying alive, or making your home in a particular place, like when you say, "I <i>live</i> on the planet Earth for the time being." When <i>live</i> rhymes with <i>hive</i>, it is an entirely different word with a very similar meaning, an adjective that means "not dead", or "living". So you could describe your two pet fish by saying, "The one on the left, floating upside down, is the dead fish, and the one on the right is the <i>live</i> fish."</p></div>`;
