Such a word is <i>orison</i>, which means a prayer. Today, you'd be surprised to see the word outside of a poem or some liturgical reference. This comes from a Latin word meaning to speak, and it means to speak to God. It's a poetic word Shakespeare used in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, when Juliet says, "I have need of many orisons" as she prepares to deceive her parents.</p></div>`;
