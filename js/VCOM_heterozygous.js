If the two alleles at a locus are identical to each other, they are homozygous; if they are different from one another, they are <i>heterozygous</i>.</p><p class="long">Like all words with the prefix <i>hetero</i>, <i>heterozygous</i> has to do with things that are different â€” specifically genes. When alleles are heterozygous they are unalike in some way. Alleles determine the genotype, or genetic structure, of a specific gene. For example, you may have received the allele for brown eyes from your mom and the allele for blue eyes from your dad; that means that you are heterozygous for eye color. Whether an organism's genotype is heterozygous or homozygous helps to determine its appearance (which is called its phenotype).</p></div></div>`;
