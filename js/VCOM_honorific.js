There are military honorifics such as Captain and General, and religious honorifics, including Rabbi, Father, and Imam. Some honorifics come at the end of a person's name: "Mateo Garcia, PhD," and "Angela Smith, DDS," for example. The word <i>honorific</i> is also an adjective meaning "showing respect," as in an honorific award or an honorific title.</p></div></div>`;
