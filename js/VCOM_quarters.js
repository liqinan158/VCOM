If you join the Army, your <i>quarters</i> might be a dorm-like space that you share with many other people.</p><p class="long">You can use this word to mean "housing" generally, although it's most common for soldiers and servants to live in quarters. A wealthy family with maids and a butler who live in their house might set aside servants' quarters on the top floor, for example. During the period of slavery in the US, slaves also lived in quarters. If you and your brother live in "close <i>quarters</i>," it means the two of you share a fairly small room.</p></div></div>`;
