If you walk through any shopping mall or public park, you'll see many people who like to hang around there. Sometimes this verb means "associate with," so your grandma might ask, "Why do you <i>hang around</i> with those kids who have strange haircuts?" This phrase dates from the early nineteenth century.</p></div></div>`;
