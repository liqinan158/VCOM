Winning a student council election isn't just about <i>popularity</i> â€” you also have to have good ideas and be willing to work hard.</p><p class="long">Having popularity means that there are many people in your corner, supporting or liking you. The popularity of an internet celebrity might disappear suddenly, while the popularity of your favorite writers and artists seems to last for generations. This kind of popularity implies being adored by people who don't even know you in person (the word comes from a Latin root meaning "the people"), while your popularity among your friends is a more personal type.</p></div>`;
