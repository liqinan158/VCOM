Your gym teacher may have trained the class so well that all chattering will <i>cease</i> every time she blows her whistle.</p><p class="long"><i>Cease</i> comes from the Old French <i>cesser</i>, which means "come to an end," "go away," "give up," or "yield." Although <i>cease</i> often appears in the past tense with "-ed," <i>cease</i> is common for talking about things as they come to an end.
