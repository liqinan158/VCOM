In the last half of the 1800s, the British writer Mary Ann Evans published many acclaimed novels under her pen name, George Eliot, which she used because women writers weren't generally taken seriously at the time. Mark Twain is another famous pen name, chosen by Samuel Clemons because it was also a riverboat pilot's call meaning "two fathoms deep."</p></div></div>`;
