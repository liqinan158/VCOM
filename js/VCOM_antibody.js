Each <i>antibody</i> is designed to target a particular opponent.</p><p class="long">A powerful part of the body’s immune system, an antibody is produced when the body senses an invader — called an  <i>antigen</i> that it doesn’t think should be there. The body then sends out the antibody to neutralize it. Don’t think of an antibody as being anti or “against” your body; think of the <i>body</i> in the word <i>antibody</i> as the antigen, or foreign body that is being fought. Known antibodies have been especially useful in the creation of vaccines.</p></div></div>`;
