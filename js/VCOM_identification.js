You can also have an identification with a person if you share common beliefs, traditions, or values; then you can say that you identify with that person. <i>Identification</i> can also mean the process of recognizing or identifying something. You may have to wait to adopt that stray dog until the pound has put the pooch through an identification process, trying to see if he already belongs to another family.</p></div></div>`;
