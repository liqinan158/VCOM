In ye olden times, <i>spouse</i> was used as a verb meaning “to marry,” but nowadays, it functions as a noun referring to either husband or wife.</p><p class="long">Your <i>spouse</i> is often called "your better half." What we call adultery used to be referred to as spouse-breach in the early 13th century. American pediatrician Benjamin Spock said, “The surest measure of a man's or a woman's maturity is the harmony, style, joy, and dignity he creates in his marriage, and the pleasure and inspiration he provides for his spouse.” So, avoid that spouse-breaching at all costs, and till death do you part.</p></div></div>`;
