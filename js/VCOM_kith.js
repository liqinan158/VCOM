If you're asking all of your best friends over for dinner, you can say that you're inviting your <i>kith</i>.</p><p class="long">It's very rare to see the word <i>kith</i> unless it's accompanied by the word <i>kin</i>, or "relations." The phrase "<i>kith</i> and kin" means "friends and family." If every actor in your local community theater's production of "The Sound of Music" invites his or her kith and kin, the seats will be full on opening night. <i>Kith</i> comes from the Old English <i>cyðð</i>, which means "kinfolk, neighbors," and also "home, knowledge, and acquaintance."</p></div>`;
