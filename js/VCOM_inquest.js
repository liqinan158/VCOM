If a person in your family dies suddenly, you might attend an <i>inquest</i> at the courthouse.</p><p class="long">A death doesn't always require an inquest â€” they are typically carried out when there is something unexplained or suspicious about the way someone died. The inquest might be a step before a murder investigation, for example. Like a trial, a court inquest typically has a verdict issued by a judge, which might be "natural death" or "accidental death." The Old French root word is <i>enqueste</i>, or "inquiry."</p></div></div>`;
