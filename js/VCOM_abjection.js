A series of terrible jobs might send you into a state of <i>abjection</i>.</p><p class="long">Disappointments and bad luck can lead to a feeling of abjection, like the abjection of a gloomy poet or the abjection you can sense in the losers of a spelling bee. <i>Abjection</i> comes from the adjective <i>abject</i>, which means hopeless or unpleasant. The Latin root is <i>abjectionem</i>, which is literally  "a throwing away," though its common meaning is "dejection or despondency."</p></div>`;
