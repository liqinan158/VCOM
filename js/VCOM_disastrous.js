Something that's <i>disastrous</i> has terrible consequences.</p><p class="long">Any action that can cause serious damage is potentially disastrous, like driving too fast on an icy road or climbing a tree during a thunderstorm. You can also use the word <i>disastrous</i> to talk about something that's merely unsuccessful. You could have a disastrous first date, or a disastrous attempt to house-train your puppy. <i>Disastrous</i> comes from the French <i>d√©sastreux</i>, "ill-starred" or "unlucky."</p></div>`;
