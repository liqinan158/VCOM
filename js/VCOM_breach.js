If you'd contracted to mow your neighbor's lawn and don't do it, he can sue you for <i>breach</i> of contract. Or he can mow the lawn himself.</p><p class="long"><i>Breach</i> traces back to the Old English verb: <i>brecan</i>, "to break," which is what <i>breach</i> really means â€” "a breaking of something." Breach of contract is a legal way of saying you broke a promise. If your great aunt Edna is a stickler for propriety, she may be horrified when you eat your meat with the salad fork, considering it a breach of good manners.</p></div>`;
