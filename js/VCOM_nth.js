In everyday speech, <i>nth</i> satisfies a similar need â€” it stands for an unspecific large number. So you might complain that it's the nth time this month you've missed the bus, or that a popular TV show is stupid to the nth degree. <i>Nth</i> has been used in this way since the late 1800s, from <i>n</i> as an abbreviation of <i>number</i>.</p></div>`;
