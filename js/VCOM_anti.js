If you are <i>anti</i> love scenes, you might prefer an action flick.</p><p class="long">The word <i>anti</i> comes from the prefix <i>anti-</i>, which means “against” or “opposite,” and is still used in English words, such as <i>antibodies</i> and <i>anti-hero</i>. As a word on its own <i>anti</i> is an adjective or preposition describing a person or thing that is against someone or something else. In a casual sense <i>anti</i> is sometimes used as a noun for a person who is against something — if you’re not on the pro side, you’re an anti.</p></div>`;
