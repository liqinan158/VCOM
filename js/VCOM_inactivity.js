Some animals, like cats, typically have hours of <i>inactivity</i> every day.</p><p class="long">Your inactivity might be a symptom of boredom or exhaustion, since it's characterized by slowness, sluggishness, and a general lack of energy and motion. Inactivity in the middle of the night is perfectly normal, but your daytime inactivity will make it difficult to get anything done. The noun <i>inactivity</i> adds the prefix <i>in-</i>, "not" or "opposite of" to <i>activity</i>, which comes from a Latin root, <i>actus</i>, "a doing, a driving, or an impulse."</p></div>`;
