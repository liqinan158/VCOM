These highly organized people <i>arrange</i> everything from invitations to music, food, even the lighting in the room, meaning they put everything in order.</p><p class="long">At a concert, you look in your program to see what piece is next. There's a title, followed by the composer's name. Under that is another name, preceded by "arranged by." What does that mean? Every piece was originally written with a certain instrument or instruments in mind. In order for that music to be played by other instruments, it first has to be adapted, meaning someone has to arrange it. A symphony for kazoos? You can arrange that.</p></div>`;
