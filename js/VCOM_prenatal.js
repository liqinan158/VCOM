The word is made up of <i>pre</i>, "before" in Modern Latin, and <i>natal</i>, which comes from <i>natus</i>, Latin for "to be born." There are prenatal vitamins, prenatal exercise classes, and prenatal checkups â€” all for women who are expecting babies. Interestingly, an anagram for <i>prenatal</i> is <i>parental</i>.</p></div></div>`;
