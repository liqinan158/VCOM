If you eat something contaminated with <i>salmonella</i>, you’ll get cramps, diarrhea, and a fever for a few days. Yuk!</p><p class="long">Salmonella has nothing to do with salmon. It’s named after the American scientist Daniel E. Salmon (1850-1914), who isolated this type of Gram-negative enterobacteria in 1885. It's not good to eat raw eggs or meat because cooking kills bacteria such as salmonella. Salmonella also causes typhoid fever — people with typhoid fever can spread it around by accident, like Typhoid Mary did in the 1800’s, when she served food that made a lot of people sick.</p></div></div>`;
