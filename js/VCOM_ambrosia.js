At a picnic, <i>ambrosia</i> is a dessert made with oranges and shredded coconut. While the former bestowed immortality on all who ate it, the latter tastes very refreshing after fried chicken and potato salad.</p><p class="long">In the <i>Odyssey</i> and the <i>Iliad</i>, Homer uses the word <i>ambrosia</i> for three things: the food of the Olympians, a salve used to treat corpses, and as a perfume to cover up the smell of uncured seal skins.  Some scholars have identified ambrosia as honey while others feel that a type of hallucinogenic mushroom was meant in the myths. Regardless of all this confusion, the word is now used metaphorically to mean anything so fragrant, so delicious that it seems divine â€” including a popular orange-and-coconut confection.</p></div></div>`;
