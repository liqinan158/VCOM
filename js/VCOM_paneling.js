If you have really dark wood <i>paneling</i> in your house, you can try to lighten it up with paint, but use a primer first because the dark stain tends to show through paint.</p><p class="long">Although <i>paneling</i> usually refers to wood covering on a wall, the word <i>paneling</i> is derived from <i>panel</i>, which originally referred to cloth. <i>Panel</i> is an Old French word meaning a piece of cloth, and that word is from the Latin word <i>pannus</i>, which has the same meaning. Today, there are many different types of wood paneling, including board and batten, bead board, tongue and groove, and flat or raised panels.</p></div>`;
