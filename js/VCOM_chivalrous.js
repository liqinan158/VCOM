Medieval knights are no longer with us, but <i>chivalrous</i> has survived in modern usage, usually to describe a man — or a behavior — showing courtesy or attentiveness toward women. So the guy holding the door open for you with a flourish may or may not be your “knight in shining armor," but his <i>chivalrous</i> act gives him something in common with the medieval knights of lore.</p></div></div>`;
