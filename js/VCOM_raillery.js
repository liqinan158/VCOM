There will probably be a bit of <i>raillery</i> between elementary school students on a field trip bus, for example.</p><p class="long">If you engage in raillery, you make fun of someone — but lightheartedly, not in a way that would cause offense. The raillery between good friends or siblings might include laughter and teasing, or a joking banter back and forth. To <i>rail</i> is to complain, although its Middle French root, <i>railler</i>, means "to tease or joke," possibly from the Old Provençal word <i>ralhar</i>, "to scoff or to joke."</p></div></div>`;
