A <i>prominent</i> person might be the big cheese, the head honcho, the top dog â€” not just any Joe Schmo.</p><p class="long">A <i>prominence</i> is anything that juts out, like a bone or a mountain ridge. <i>Prominent</i>, then, means "sticking out" either in a literal sense ("a prominent nose") or a figurative one ("a prominent figure in the industry"). The metaphorical sense of "famous" is the most common one today, though references to the "<i>prominent</i> posterior" of Jennifer Lopez might fit both definitions.</p></div></div>`;
