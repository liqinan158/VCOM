You'll be disappointed (and maybe even annoyed) if you're paid a <i>measly</i> six dollars to babysit a toddler for two hours.</p><p class="long">If you've got a measly ten minutes to eat lunch between classes, it's a laughably short amount of time â€” hardly enough to unwrap your tuna sandwich. And when a detective has a measly number of clues to help her solve a crime, it can seem nearly impossible. This informal word comes from British slang, and it originally meant "affected by measles."</p></div></div>`;
