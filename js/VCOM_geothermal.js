The prefix <i>geo-</i>, or "earth," makes it clear that this type of heat rises from the planet itself. Hot springs are warmed by geothermal energy. Geothermal energy is also a renewable source of heat and power. Many buildings use geothermal heating and it's also a good way to generate electricity.</p></div></div>`;
