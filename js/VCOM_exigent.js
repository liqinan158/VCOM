If there's a runaway train driving straight at you, that's an exigent situation â€” not a good time to stop and write a poem.  When circumstances become exigent, it's time to act.  When exigent questions arise, an answer is necessary.  You can also use <i>exigent</i> for a person who demands attention, usually by complaining.  If you've ever worked as a waiter, you've surely dealt with an exigent customer.</p></div>`;
