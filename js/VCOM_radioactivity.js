While <i>radioactivity</i> can be useful in science and medicine, exposure to high doses of it is dangerous.</p><p class="long">Archaeologists can learn the age of certain fossils by measuring their radioactivity — or more specifically, the amount of radioactive carbon they contain. Radioactivity is what creates nuclear power, and doctors also use it in radiation therapy, to kill cancer cells. Too much radioactivity is bad for our bodies, though, since it can damage our DNA. The word comes from <i>radioactivité</i>, which was coined by Marie and Pierre Curie in 1898.</p></div>`;
