A <i>taxi</i> is a car you hire to drive you somewhere. In some big cities, all you have to do is raise your hand and yell "<i>taxi!</i>" and a <i>taxi</i> will pull up next to you.</p><p class="long">You can also refer to a taxi as a <i>cab</i> or a <i>taxicab</i>. Most taxis are cars, although boats for hire are sometimes also called taxis. As a verb, <i>taxi</i> describes what airplanes do when they move very slowly on a runway. Officially, <i>taxi</i> is short for <i>taximeter cab</i>, as they were originally named at the turn of the 20th century. Today the taximeter, which records distance and fare, is usually just called a <i>meter.</i></p></div>`;
