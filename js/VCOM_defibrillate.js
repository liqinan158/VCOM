Doctors and EMTs sometimes have to <i>defibrillate</i> patients having heart attacks.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>defibrillate</i> comes from <i>defibrillation</i> and its roots, <i>de-</i>, "undo-, and <i>fibrillation</i>, "beating in an abnormal way." So when a patient's heartbeat is dangerously abnormal, doctors will sometimes defibrillate it to shock it back into a normal rhythm. The tool they use to perform this procedure is a <i>defibrillator</i>.</p></div>`;
