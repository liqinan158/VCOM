So if you get headaches from long bus rides, it's best to travel equipped with the key pain alleviating <i>antidotes</i>: Tylenol, lots of water and soothing music.</p><p class="long">A noun that comes all the way to us from the ancient Greek word <i>antidoton</i>, which means “given as a remedy,” an <i>antidote</i> counteracts or relieves the negative effects of something. You can find antidotes to poison, anxiety, sadness or even a bad day. People tend to think of medicinal cures when they hear the word <i>antidote</i>, but things like meditation, sleep, green tea, exercise or a good hug can all have positive, <i>antidotal</i> affects.</p></div></div>`;
