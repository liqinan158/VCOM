Your grandmother might declare that she doesn't understand the music you like, saying, "They don't sing — they just <i>gabble</i>!" <i>Gabble</i> is a noun, too, meaning the sound itself: "See? It's all just <i>gabble</i>!" <i>Gabble</i> has a Dutch root, <i>gabbelen</i>, which is imitative — it sounds just like what it means.</p></div>`;
