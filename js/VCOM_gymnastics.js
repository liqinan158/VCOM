Today's elite gymnasts work just as hard to perfect routines for competition. Women and girls compete in four gymnastics events: uneven bars, vault, floor excercise, and balance beam. Men's gymnastics includes four events: floor exercise, vault, pommel horse rings, high bar, and parallel bars. The word <i>gymnastics</i> shares a root with <i>gymnasium</i>: the Greek word <i>gymnazein</i>, "to exercise or train."</p></div>`;
