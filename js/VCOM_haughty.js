When you're <i>haughty</i>, you have a big attitude and act like you're better than other people.</p><p class="long">A haughty person acts superior and looks down on others. Haughty people are disdainful, overbearing, prideful, swaggering, and obnoxious. Acting amazed that others haven't heard of a hot new band is haughty. Speaking in a cocky or superior way is haughty. The word even sounds a little like its meaning: it's hard to say <i>haughty</i> without sounding like you have an attitude. If you're acting like others are beneath you, you're being haughty.</p></div>`;
