If you wonder why anyone would buy the more expensive "fair trade" coffee, you probably make buying decisions <i>amorally</i>.</p><p class="long">When you do something amorally, you do it in an ethically indifferent way, without stopping to contemplate whether it's good or bad. That doesn't mean, as with the word <i>immorally</i>, that what you're doing is wicked, it just means that you're not concerned about the moral consequences of your actions.</p></div>`;
