A <i>ladder</i> has steps you use to reach up high. If you climb the corporate <i>ladder</i>, you’re moving up in the business world.</p><p class="long">Some ladders are just a few feet tall, and others are taller than a house. Still others are invisible –- any time you move up in your career as a banker or NFL football player, you climb the ladder. In British English, a ladder is a run in stockings, which is funny because it usually looks like one. The superstition that it's bad luck to walk under an open ladder dates from the eighteenth century.</p></div></div>`;
