Now you know what your friend meant when she told you to write your lemonade stand sign in <i>majuscule</i>.</p><p class="long">The term <i>majuscule</i> was originally used in the 18th century for an uppercase letter, from the Latin <i>maiusculus</i>, "somewhat larger," a close relative of <i>major</i>. Its antonym, <i>minuscule</i>, is much more commonly used today. You can feel free to impress your friends by using it for capital letters: "I wrote my whole essay using majuscule to make it look more impressive."</p></div>`;
