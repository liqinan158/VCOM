A <i>peninsula</i> juts into the water but has at least a narrow a connection to land. If the boot broke off from Italy just below the "knee," it would be an island.</p><p class="long">The word <i>peninsula</i>, which entered English in the 16th century, comes from the Latin words <i>paene,</i> "almost," and <i>insula,</i> "island." Some confuse an island with a peninsula because both are surrounded by so much water, but a peninsula is connected to a mainland at some point, while an island is completely encircled by water. In most cases, a peninsula is narrow and long, resembling an arm or leg.</p></div>`;
