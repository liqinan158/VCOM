Usually the word <i>spectator</i> refers to people watching games or "spectator sports," but you could be a spectator at any planned event. An easy way to remember this word is to think of spectacles, glasses used to view something clearly â€” both from the same Latin root <i>spectare</i>.</p></div>`;
