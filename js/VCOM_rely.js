You might <i>rely</i> on staying in bed to make you feel better and <i>rely</i> on your friends to tell you everything you missed when you were sick.</p><p class="long"><i>Rely</i> is a lot like the word depend. If you rely on someone for help, you also depend on her. But <i>rely</i> is even more powerful! When you rely on someone, you have total faith and trust that she will come through. It comes from the Latin word <i>religare</i> which means "to fasten or bind." You're bound to the people you rely on!</p></div></div>`;
