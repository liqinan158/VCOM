You might collect <i>fallen</i> apples to make into cider or applesauce.</p><p class="long">The most literal sense of something <i>fallen</i> is just what it sounds like â€” an object that's moved from a high place to a lower place, usually due to gravity. There are also some figurative meanings: a fallen soldier has died on the battlefield, and a fallen person has committed a moral sin or ruined his reputation. In the 17th century, <i>fallen</i> frequently meant "morally ruined," more often describing a women than a man.</p></div>`;
