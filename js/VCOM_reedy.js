The <i>reedy</i> singer in your middle school choir might have a <i>reedy</i> voice.</p><p class="long">Reedy people are lanky and tall, with long, slender legs that resemble reeds, the broad-leafed grasses that grow in marshy areas. Reedy sounds, on the other hand, seem to be made from a reed (or woodwind) instrument, like a clarinet. So your reedy singing voice is high and thin, rather than bold and deep like your father's baritone.</p></div></div>`;
