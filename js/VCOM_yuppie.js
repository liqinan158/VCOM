Yuppies are distinguished by their disposable income and the things on which they choose to spend it, like clothes, food, and cars. <i>Yuppie</i> is a shortened form of "young urban professional," and its popularity won out over other acronyms of the time, "yumpie," for "young upwardly mobile professional, and "yap," for "young aspiring professional."</p></div></div>`;
