Together with phloem, which transports the sugar made during photosynthesis, xylem helps keep plants healthy and growing. In woody plants, including trees, the xylem tissue dies off as the plant grows, becoming the "wood" of its trunk or stem. The word <i>xlyem</i>, originally coined in German, comes from the Greek <i>xylon</i>, "wood."</p></div>`;
