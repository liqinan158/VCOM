var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">regard</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you give someone a good, long look, you <i>regard</i> them. It can also mean "to believe," as in "I <i>regard</i> her as my best friend."</p><p class="long"><i>Regard</i> often means respect and admiration, as in "I have the greatest <i>regard</i> for my grandmother." Sometimes it's a greeting: you can send someone your regards, which means to tell them you said hello and wish them well. There's a famous song called, "Give My Regards to Broadway." On the other hand, you can use it as a sign-off on a letter. Instead of "Sincerely" or "Yours Truly," you can close with "Regards."</p></div>`;
