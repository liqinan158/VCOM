Before he was the coolest face on a T-shirt, Che Guevara was ready to die for change in South America (and in fact, he did). You don't need to be violent to be <i>revolutionary</i>, just ask Gandhi and Rev. Martin Luther King. You don't even need to be political.  Alexander McQueen, John Lennon, and Picasso could tell you that.</p></div>`;
