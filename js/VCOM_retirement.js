This most commonly happens after years at a job, and retirement is often a cause of celebration. Sometimes, as in "early <i>retirement</i>," a much younger person is able to stop working for pay â€” in some cases, because she's become wealthy from a business venture. The Middle French root word is <i>retirer</i>, "to withdraw."</p></div></div>`;
