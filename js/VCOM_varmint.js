Your uncle Bob might see a mouse and yell loudly, "Get out of my kitchen, you <i>varmint</i>!"</p><p class="long">You won't be surprised to encounter varmints during a walk in the woods, though you probably don't expect to run into them in your bathroom or at the library. A pesky animal is most likely to be referred to this way, like a raccoon that keeps knocking your trash cans over. You can also call a human a <i>varmint</i>, especially if it's someone who's driving you crazy. <i>Varmint</i>, since the 1500's, has been an American slang version of <i>vermin</i>.</p></div></div>`;
