So if you skip your Biology test on March 17th, your parents might deduce that your enjoyment of the St. Patrick's Day parade was a <i>precipitant</i> of your actions.</p><p class="long">See the <i>pre</i> in <i>precipitant</i>? Since <i>pre</i> means "before," you can remember that a precipitant always comes before something else. <i>Precipitant</i> can also mean "hasty" â€” a precipitant marriage is one where both parties marry too quickly. Not to be confused with <i>percipient,</i> meaning someone with unusual sensitivity and understanding of people and events. A percipient person would never skip his Biology test.</p></div>`;
