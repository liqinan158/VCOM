It’s predictable. <i>Tame</i> can be used as an adjective or verb. A circus lion is <i>tame</i> (adjective) because it’s been <i>tamed</i> (verb). A “lion-tamer” beat the wildness out of it.</p><p class="long">Sometimes <i>tame</i> isn’t fun — and not just for the bears who ride bicycles under the Big Top. Tame isn’t appealing when you’re going on a rollercoaster or seeing a fireworks display. If a friend tells you a concert is <i>tame,</i> will you rush out for tickets? <i>Tame</i>, however, is not all bad. Some people take anger management courses to learn to “tame their tempers.” Others work to “tame their tongues” after hurting another person with a careless comment.</p></div></div>`;
