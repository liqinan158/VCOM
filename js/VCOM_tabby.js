There are different breeds of <i>tabby</i> cats. Occasionally one will dangle off a branch under a caption that says, “Hang in there.”</p><p class="long"><i>Tabby</i> can refer to domesticated cats, but it's also an adjective describing the stripy pattern itself. Tabby cats, with their swirling tabby patches, might also have a marking in the shape of an <i>M</i> on their foreheads. Maine coon cats are one example of a tabby breed. In the 1600's, <i>tabby</i> was a kind of striped silk fabric, and the word comes from the Arabic <i>'Attabiy</i>, a Baghdad neighborhood where the cloth was traditionally produced.</p></div>`;
