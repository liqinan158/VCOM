The audience can't see what's going on <i>backstage</i>.</p><p class="long">If you get a backstage pass at a rock concert, it means you'll get to go behind the scenes once the show is over, and possibly meet the musicians in person. Many people who are involved in a show, performance, or play stay backstage the whole time: costume designers, makeup directors, and set painters, for example. The word is also sometimes used in a figurative way to mean "secret" or "behind the scenes."</p></div>`;
