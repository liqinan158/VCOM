var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">abdication</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Abdication</i> is the formal act of stepping down from something, especially a king giving up the throne. An <i>abdication</i> is a type of resignation.</p><p class="long">When a king — or another person in power — gives up that position, they abdicate. Such an act is then called an abdication. The roots of this word mean <i>declare</i> in Latin, and that's an important part of the meaning. Abdicating isn't just quitting: it's formally quitting, including a declaration of quitting. There’s no such thing as a private abdication. After an abdication, there's a vacuum of power, and there may be a power struggle to fill the empty position.</p></div>`;
