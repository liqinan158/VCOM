Another way to use the word <i>realization</i> is to mean the fulfillment of something that was previously only imagined, like the realization of your dream of becoming a pastry chef, or the realization on stage of the play you scribbled on napkins and scraps of paper. <i>Realization</i> grew out of the French <i>r√©aliser</i>, "to make real."</p></div>`;
