If you love to sing but don't fancy a solo turn on a TV talent show, perhaps joining a <i>choir</i> would satisfy you.</p><p class="long"><i>Choir</i>, pronounced QUIRE, comes from the Latin word <i>chorus</i>, which itself comes from the Greek name for a group of singers and dancers. We still use <i>chorus</i> for singing or dancing, but <i>choir</i> is exclusively for singing groups. Although choirs are traditionally associated with church services, they don't have to be. If you love singing but aren't religious, you could start a choir that sings about the glory of donuts. It's also a verb, as in, "I love to choir."</p></div>`;
