But as its darkened nature implies, <i>shady</i> has the equally popular meaning of "suspicious, dangerous, or deceitful." A "<i>shady</i> character" is up to no good.</p><p class="long">The metaphorical meaning of <i>shady</i> has long been embraced by slang. Since at least the 1950's, the phrase "got it made in the <i>shade</i>" means having a great and easy life or job (picture eastern sultans being shaded by servants holding giant leaves). The rap sultan Eminem calls his evil alter-ego "Slim Shady," conjuring up a devilish suggestion of the Prince of Darkness himself â€” someone who definitely lives in a shady neighborhood.</p></div></div>`;
