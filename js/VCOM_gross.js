When something is <i>gross</i>, it's disgusting. The noun, a <i>gross</i>, is the complete amount (before expenses), and the verb "to <i>gross</i>" is to bring in money.</p><p class="long">Two things will tell you which meaning is the right one with a word like <i>gross</i>: the part of speech and the context. If you're talking about awful, sickening, vile things, you're looking at the adjective <i>gross</i>. If you're referring to, say, how much money a movie made, that's the noun <i>gross</i>; but remember, the gross is how much the movie made in total, not how much it cleared in profit after expenses (the <i>net</i>). As a noun, <i>gross</i> can also be a unit of measurement: if your teacher orders a gross of pencils, he'll get a shipment of 12 dozen. The verb <i>to gross</i> means to pull in money, as in: the bake sale grossed 30 dollar.</p></div></div>`;
