If your usually grumpy brother is suddenly nice and sweet, you'll impugn his motives if you're smart â€” he probably just wants something from you.</p><p class="long">The root of <i>impugn</i> is the Latin <i>pugnare</i> which means "to fight," so when you impugn, you are fighting or attacking, but by saying that something is false or wrong. If a candidate has a record that cannot be impugned, his or her opponent might go for a character attack. If you take pride in your work, you will be especially insulted if someone impugns your professionalism or integrity.</p></div></div>`;
