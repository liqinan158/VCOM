The word developed a religious meaning in the 15th century, when it came to be used to refer to any distortion of church doctrine. Around 1700, the word developed a secular meaning, denoting what was considered deviant sexual behavior â€” often any sexual behavior other than that used to reproduce.</p></div>`;
