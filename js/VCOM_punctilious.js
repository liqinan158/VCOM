Are you always precisely on time? Is your room perfectly neat? Do you never forget a birthday or a library book's due date? Then you are one of the <i>punctilious</i> people.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>punctilious</i>, pronounced "punk-TIL-ee-us," is related to the Italian word <i>puntiglio</i>, meaning "fine point." For someone who is <i>punctilious</i> no point is too fine, no detail too small, to be overlooked. The word is often used to describe people, but it can be used more broadly to apply to observations, behavior, or anything else that is characterized by close attention to detail.</p></div>`;
