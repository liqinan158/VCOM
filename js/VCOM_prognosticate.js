When a lot of natural disasters start happening close together, you might <i>prognosticate</i> that the world is ending, a prediction that's actually thousands of years old.</p><p class="long">From the Latin <i>prognosticāre,</i> meaning "make a prediction," the verb <i>prognosticate</i> means to foretell or predict what is coming. While a fortuneteller or palm reader might claim special powers for seeing into the future, you can prognosticate by looking at real evidence and making a reasonable conclusion about how events will unfold. Sometimes, though, what you prognosticate from a dream or a fortune-cookie message ends up happening too, which is less reasonable but pretty neat — unless the world really does end.</p></div>`;
