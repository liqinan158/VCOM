You may have heard that it is good to start off a speech with <i>witticism</i> because if you make the audience laugh, it'll help them — and you — relax.</p><p class="long">English playwright and poet John Dryden coined the word <i>witticism</i> in the seventeenth century, combining the words <i>witty</i> and <i>criticism</i> to come up with a word to describe a clever quip that has a hint of sharpness or irony. A witticism is typically a one-liner that humorously sums up the current situation — with a little bit of attitude thrown in.</p></div>`;
