A <i>shocked</i> audience might gasp and cover their faces as the sword swallower begins to actually swallow a sword.</p><p class="long">In its earliest use, <i>shocked</i> described people who were "shaken violently," like the shocked victims of a car crash or a shocked survivor of the Titanic. Today it's also used to mean "scandalized," like the shocked readers of a gossip column. <i>Shocked</i> can be traced back to the noun <i>shock</i> and its original sixteenth century meaning, "a violent encounter between warriors."</p></div>`;
