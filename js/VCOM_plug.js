There are also accidental plugs that block the flow of water through a pipe, and plugs that fit securely in wall sockets. These plugs form a connection between an electrical source and an appliance, rather than stemming the flow. And to <i>plug</i> means to stop up or block, or alternately, to try hard to promote something.</p></div>`;
