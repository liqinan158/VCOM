The word wasn't used this way until the early 1990s. Before that, it was mostly used interchangeably with "poacher" to mean "someone who pursues and steals game animals." The Old English word <i>stelan</i> lead to the English word <i>steal</i>, which is most likely the root of <i>stalk</i>.</p></div></div>`;
