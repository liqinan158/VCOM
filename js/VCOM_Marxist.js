If you're a <i>Marxist</i>, you're especially critical of capitalism.</p><p class="long">Marxists are particularly concerned with the struggles of lower and middle class workers, with the conflict between social classes, and with economic inequality. The ultimate goal of a Marxist is revolution that results in a classless society with fair distribution of goods. Karl Marx was a German philosopher, but the word was first coined in French, <i>marxiste</i>, in the late 1800s.</p></div></div>`;
