The big gray and white seabirds that try to steal your lunch are gulls, and the tiny seabirds that look like wind-up toys running in a group along the tideline may be plovers. Most seabirds nest in large colonies, and most of them are also migratory, meaning they travel many miles during the course of a year, often circumnavigating the entire planet.</p></div></div>`;
