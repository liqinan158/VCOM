Lunch happens every day, after 4th period, so it's safe to say it's <i>periodic</i>. Something <i>periodic</i> doesn't have to happen at regular intervals, though.</p><p class="long">The word "period" is the key to the meaning of <i>periodic</i>, because something periodic can happen only after a period of time. Periodic visits to the vet are a good way to make sure that your pet stays healthy. Why not just use "occasional," you ask. Good question. <i>Periodic</i> implies that the thing will continue to happen over and overâ€”periodically. Like comets and victories by the Yankees. These things are reliable, if periodic.</p></div></div>`;
