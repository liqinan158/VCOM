In American English, the verb <i>table</i> means to set a matter aside indefinitely. For example, if state senators can't come to a compromise about new zoning laws, they might simply decide to table the issue. Confusingly, British English uses the verb <i>table</i> in precisely the opposite way: if members of the English Parliament table a piece of legislation, they formally submit it for discussion or debate.</p></div></div>`;
