Traditionally, a <i>ballroom</i> has either a hardwood or marble floor.</p><p class="long">Most private houses are built without ballrooms these days, but it was once common for a grand home or mansion to include a special room for throwing dance parties. These ballrooms were large, with high ceilings, and could accommodate a live band and many dancers. Ballroom dancing was originally a formal, social dance form that only happened in ballrooms. The word comes from <i>ball</i>, or party, with the Latin root <i>ballare</i>, "to dance."</p></div></div>`;
