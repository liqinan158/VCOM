When you <i>circumnavigate</i> the world, will you do it in a boat or a hot air balloon?</p><p class="long"><i>Circumnavigate</i> breaks down to <i>circum-</i>, "around," and <i>navigare</i>, "to navigate." It was first used in the era when sailors were trying to find new lands they didn't know about, and so the "around" in question was the trip around the entire earth. We also use <i>circumnavigate</i> to describe going around something that's too hard to go through, like when you circumnavigate the massive crowds in Times Square on New Year's Eve.</p></div></div>`;
