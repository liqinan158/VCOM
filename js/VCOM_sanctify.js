You might see a priest <i>sanctify</i> a church in your neighborhood — that means it’s holy.</p><p class="long"><i>Sanctify</i> often has a religious connotation. If you get married, you might have a religious ceremony to sanctify your union. That means the marriage is viewed as legitimate according to your religion. <i>Sanctify</i> can also mean that something is made free from sin, like when the Pope sanctifies a person. Or you can use it for anything that’s made right or acceptable. Your mom’s support may sanctify the odd outfit you wore to the family reunion. Thanks, Mom!</p></div>`;
