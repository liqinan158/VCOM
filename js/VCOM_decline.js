var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">decline</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When something <i>declines</i>, it goes downhill. If you stop working out, your health may <i>decline</i>. If you want it to improve, you should start climbing inclines instead of coasting down <i>declines</i>.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>decline</i> means refuse to accept, but the noun <i>decline</i> means a downward slope (the opposite of an <i>incline</i>), or a decrease in quality. At the gym, the treadmill has an <i>incline</i> button to control how steep your climb is. Sadly, there's no button for <i>decline</i>, which would be much easier. Both words contain <i>cline</i>, or "to bend." The prefix tells you which way the bend goes. <i>Decline</i> implies a going, or turning, down.</p></div></div>`;
