If you've got five minutes to eat breakfast, you might quickly <i>chomp</i> your bagel as you walk to catch the bus.</p><p class="long">People who chomp their food are either extremely hungry or somewhat ill-mannered: watching someone chomp a hamburger and fries can make you lose your appetite. You can also use <i>chomp</i> as a noun, to mean "a great big bite," as when your brother grabs your slice of pizza and takes a chomp. The word has been used in American English since the mid-1600s, from the earlier verb <i>champ</i>.</p></div></div>`;
