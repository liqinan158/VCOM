As a noun, it means a slowing: "The coach was disappointed by the <i>lag</i> in her swimmers' best times that day." When you <i>lag</i> behind someone, you fall back or don't measure up. A student who struggles with math, for example, might say that his grades lag behind his best friend's. In the 1550s, <i>lag</i> meant "last person."</p></div></div>`;
