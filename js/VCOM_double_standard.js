If a teacher lets all the boys bring candy for lunch but not the girls, that’s a <i>double standard</i>.</p><p class="long">A standard is a way of evaluating someone, and a double standard is two-faced. It’s like having a rule that applies to some people one way and another way to others. Men getting paid more for the same work than women is a double standard. Anytime some are held to a higher standard than others, there's a double standard because everyone isn't being treated fairly.</p></div></div>`;
