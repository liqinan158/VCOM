The place name <i>tuxedo</i>, according to one line of etymological inquiry, is from an Algonquian word for "wolf," <i>p'tuksit</i>, while other scholars guess that it simply means "crooked river," <i>p'tuck-sepo</i>. Either way, a tuxedo today can also be called a dinner jacket or even the slangy "monkey suit," just for fun.</p></div>`;
