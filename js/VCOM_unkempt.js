Your hair probably looks <i>unkempt</i> when you roll out of bed in the morning. Keep it that way if you're going for the rock star look.</p><p class="long">From the fusing of <i>un-</i> “not” with <i>kempt</i> “neat” comes the adjective <i>unkempt</i>. <i>Kempt</i> has fallen out of use, but <i>unkempt</i> persists as a popular word to describe anything unpolished, rough, or disorderly. Pig sties, the corrals where pigs live, are usually quite unkempt. That's why your mom keeps calling your messy, unkempt train wreck of a room a pig sty.</p></div>`;
