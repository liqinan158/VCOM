You can be pretty sure those Air Jordan sneakers are <i>knockoffs</i> if they only cost you ten dollars.</p><p class="long">Anything fake that looks almost exactly like the authentic version is a knockoff, from knockoff designer handbags to collectible baseball cards to prescription medication. You can also call these imitation goods <i>counterfeits</i>, like a painting that sells for a million dollars only to be revealed as a Monet knockoff. The goal of those who produce knockoffs is almost always to fool shoppers into thinking they're buying the real thing.</p></div></div>`;
