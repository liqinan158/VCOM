You can also figuratively <i>whip</i> an opponent or <i>whip</i> someone in shape. Giddy up!</p><p class="long">When you hit an animal with a whip, you whip it. Some animal rights activists object to horse racers using whips. You can also use this verb to mean "defeat by a lot," like when your basketball team whips the opposing team. A chef whips cream by whisking or mixing it until it's airy and frothy. If your teacher says he's going to "crack the <i>whip</i>," he means he's planning to use his authority to make the class work harder. And, fittingly, a political whip is someone who enforces discipline among party members.</p></div></div>`;
