You might hear news reports about a <i>marauder</i> breaking into cars in your neighborhood.</p><p class="long">The word <i>marauder</i> entered English in the 17th century, from the Middle French word <i>maraud</i>, meaning "rascal." Even in modern times, if you’re a marauder you’re certainly a rascal — probably even a criminal. A marauder doesn’t target a victim and plan a crime — instead a marauder is on the move looking for opportunities to rob people or steal things. Marauders often travel in groups, looting whatever they can.</p></div></div>`;
