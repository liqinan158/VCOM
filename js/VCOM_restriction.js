Common sense would keep you from putting a bowling ball in a paper bag; you wouldnâ€™t need a restriction to tell you not to do it. Sometimes a restriction is the result of doing something bad or misusing a privilege, as when your parents put a restriction on video gaming to limit your time in front of the TV.</p></div>`;
