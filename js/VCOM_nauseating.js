Your kitchen garbage can may be <i>nauseating</i> by the end of the week.</p><p class="long">A bad smell or taste can be nauseating, but so can a terrible feeling or a horrible situation. The prospect of speaking in front of a crowd could be nauseating to you, or reading about a natural disaster. The adjective <i>nauseating</i> comes from <i>nausea</i>, which is a sick sensation or a feeling that you're about to vomit. The root of both words is the Latin <i>nauseare</i>, "to feel seasick, to vomit, or to feel disgust."</p></div></div>`;
