Your dad's favorite kitchen <i>gadget</i> might be his special knife that cuts vegetables into spirals.</p><p class="long">The remote control your brother rigs up to the Christmas tree is a gadget, and your camping tool that folds out into various knives, corkscrews, and scissors is another kind of gadget. The original spelling was <i>gadjet</i>, and it's thought to have originated in the 1850's as sailors' slang, meaning any mechanism or ship part that either lacked a name or whose name had been forgotten. It may be rooted in the French <i>g√¢chette</i>, "piece of a mechanism."</p></div></div>`;
