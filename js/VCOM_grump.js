If you mope around all week during a rainy vacation with your family, don't be surprised if they call you a <i>grump</i>.</p><p class="long">Before <i>grump</i> came to mean a cranky person, the phrase <i>the grumps</i> was used for "a fit of ill-humor." The word may stem from a now-obsolete adjective, <i>grum</i>, "morose or surly." If your neighbor is a grump, he won't be amused by the massive water balloon fight in your yard â€” but it still may be worth baking him some cookies as an apology for scaring his little dog.</p></div></div>`;
