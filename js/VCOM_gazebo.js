If it starts raining suddenly while you're walking through the park, you can run to the <i>gazebo</i> to get out of the rain.</p><p class="long"><i>Gazebo</i> is unusual in that it's an imitation Latin word. Experts believe it comes from a joking twist on the word <i>gaze</i>, as in "I gaze at you from my gazebo." It's meant to sound Latin, modeled after words in the future tense that end with the suffix <i>-ebo</i>, like <i>videbo</i>, "I shall see." If you want to gaze at your yard from an octagonal covered porch, you should consider building a gazebo.</p></div>`;
