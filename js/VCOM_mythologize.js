Some parents <i>mythologize</i> the story of their child's birth, telling it again and again until it becomes a well-known story.</p><p class="long">When you talk about the past, or some incident or experience from your life, you can mythologize it by making it slightly more exciting and interesting, and by re-telling the tale over and over. An actual myth becomes well-known through repetition by many people over many years (generations, even). To turn an ordinary event into something of a myth is to mythologize it. The word comes from the Greek <i>mythos</i>, "story, speech, or anything delivered by word of mouth."</p></div>`;
