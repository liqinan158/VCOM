If you <i>furiously</i> tell your friend to stop looking at her phone while she drives, she's going to know you're serious.</p><p class="long">When you write an irate letter to the editor, you're likely to do it furiously, and when you deny another student's accusation that you cheated on a test, you'll respond furiously. Anything you do in an angry way is done furiously. You can also use the adjective to describe something that's done with passion, as when a little girl bicycles furiously downtown, hoping to get there right when the library opens.</p></div>`;
