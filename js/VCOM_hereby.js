For example, your bus driver might announce, "All cellphones on the bus must <i>hereby</i> be turned off and put away."</p><p class="long">The word <i>hereby</i> is especially useful for people who are issuing proclamations or reading from formal documents. A king might once have declared, "These lands are all <i>hereby</i> claimed in the name of me, the king!" And when you're on a long family car trip your dad might shout, "I <i>hereby</i> announce that I am in charge of the radio!" <i>Hereby</i> has been used in English since the thirteenth century.</p></div></div>`;
