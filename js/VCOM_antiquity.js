This isn't grandparent old â€” this is really old, like hundreds or even thousands of years old. People also use this word to compare old ways of doing things to new ways: you could say an old-fashioned idea is an antiquity that goes against modernity (newer ideas and ways of doing things). <i>Antiquity</i> can also mean the time before the Middle Ages.</p></div></div>`;
