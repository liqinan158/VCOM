Fried clams? Tuna fish sandwiches? All of these qualify as seafood. It was once fairly common to think of larger sea creatures including whales and dolphins as seafood too, although fewer people eat these animals today. The term <i>seafood</i> can also be used for fish that live in lakes and rivers, rather than oceans; and edible seaweeds like kelp.</p></div></div>`;
