Your kitchen <i>cupboard</i> might actually be full of cups, while the <i>cupboard</i> in your bedroom might hold sweaters and socks.</p><p class="long">Some cupboards are built into a wall, like a closet, while others are freestanding cabinets. A cupboard usually has doors that open and shelves inside, for storage. The very earliest cupboards, in the 14th century, were exactly what the word describes: a board or table used for putting cups or dishes on. Over the following two hundred years, <i>cupboard</i> came to mean an enclosed cabinet for the same purpose.</p></div>`;
