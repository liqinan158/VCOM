The sound of children's <i>gleeful</i> laughter is one sign of a successful birthday party.</p><p class="long">When you feel gleeful, you're more than happy: you're exuberant and joyous. A friend's gleeful face tells you she's gotten great news or heard a hilarious joke, and gleeful kids will sometimes even scream with joy. In the 17th century, the alternate adjective <i>gleesome</i> competed with <i>gleeful</i> â€” both come from an Old English root, <i>gliu</i>, which means "mirth, play, sport," and also "music" and "mockery."</p></div></div>`;
