You may <i>stifle</i> your cough if you don't want to interrupt a lecture or you may <i>stifle</i> the competition if you fear losing.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>stifle</i> means “to choke, suffocate, drown.” It can describe a claustrophobic feeling, like getting smothered by kisses from your great aunt. At its most extreme, <i>stifle</i> means to kill by cutting off respiration. The metaphoric sense of <i>stifle</i> didn’t develop until well after the word was first recorded as a verb: "I can always tell — but never let on for fear of damaging his ego — that my boyfriend attempts to <i>stifle</i> tears during sappy parts of movies; his eyes well up at the corners and he’ll sniffle uncontrollably, claiming allergies."</p></div></div>`;
