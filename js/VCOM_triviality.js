You might dislike most reality TV shows because of their <i>triviality</i>, preferring to watch documentaries about serious subjects.</p><p class="long">You can also use the word <i>triviality</i> to mean an unimportant detail: "Let's discuss world peace instead of focusing on trivialities like what's for lunch or which celebrities are getting divorced!" It comes from the Latin word <i>trivium</i>, which means "commonplace," but also "crossroads." Literally, it's a combination of  <i>tri</i>, or "three," and <i>via</i>, "road." Hence, a <i>trivium</i> is an oh-so-ordinary "place where three roads meet."</p></div></div>`;
