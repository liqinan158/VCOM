You might hear the terms <i>phonetics</i> and <i>phonemes</i> in the same class, both of which have to do with sound, speech, language, and meaning. All of these words have their roots in the Greek word for "voice," <i>phone</i>, and in the case of <i>phonology</i>, the Greek suffix <i>logy</i>, which means "study, science, or theory."</p></div>`;
