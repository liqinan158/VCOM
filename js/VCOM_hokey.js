A <i>hokey</i> speech is more likely to make people roll their eyes and squirm than to make them cry.</p><p class="long">You can buy your friend a hokey birthday card as a joke, or read her a hokey poem to make her laugh. There's a hint of insincerity when something's hokey — people can tell that the sentiments in your hokey yearbook quote aren't entirely genuine. In the mid-1800s, <i>hokey-pokey</i> was defined as "false, cheap material," possibly based on <i>hocus-pocus</i>, and usually referring to artificial flavoring in cheap ice cream. Today, the <i>hokey-pokey</i> is mainly known as a silly dance.</p></div></div>`;
