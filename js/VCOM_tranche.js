An installment of a loan is a <i>tranche</i>.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>tranche</i> comes from the French word <i>trancher</i>, "to cut," which should help you remember that a tranche is a portion of something, not the whole thing. Usually, it's part of a larger sum of money, like a mortgage payment, half of a bonus payment, or an installment of lottery winnings. People who work in banking and finance use <i>tranche</i> to mean one bond or security within a larger financial deal.</p></div>`;
