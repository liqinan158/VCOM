People promise small things,  like to visit someone, and big things, like marriage: “Til death do us part” is a <i>promise</i> many people make on their wedding day. Another meaning is to make a prediction, as in, "You'll regret this, I promise!” Also, if you show <i>promise</i> playing the violin, maybe someday you'll play in an orchestra.</p></div></div>`;
