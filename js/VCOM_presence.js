When you get an invitation that reads "Your <i>presence</i> is requested,” you are being asked to show up. Your style of being there — your demeanor or bearing — is also your <i>presence</i>.</p><p class="long">Usually, <i>presence</i> is a physical thing.  Since the 1600s, the word has also meant something otherwordly, a spiritual or divine presence.  If you suddenly feel a weird presence in the room, perhaps it's a ghost . . . or just the cat.  Use the phrase "presence of mind" to indicate when someone is quick-witted or just paying attention.  While your job washing skyscraper windows doesn't require a lot of brain work, it's a good idea to keep your presence of mind while working.</p></div>`;
