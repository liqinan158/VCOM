If you have a <i>philosophic</i> attitude, you face trouble with a level head, like a deep thinker.</p><p class="long">To some extent, you can use <i>philosophic</i> interchangeably with the more widely-used <i>philosophical</i> whenever you're talking about philosophy. It's more common, though, to save <i>philosophic</i> for the academic discipline rather than a more general context. So you might discuss the philosophic texts in your ethics class or Marx's philosophic thoughts on a particular subject. The word <i>philosophic</i> can also describe being calm in the face of defeat or loss. <i>Philosophic</i> comes from the Greek <i>philosophia</i>, "love of knowledge."</p></div>`;
