Men and boys usually wear them, but some women and girls wear them, too. <i>Yarmulke</i> is a Yiddish word that sounds kind of like “yah-ma-kah.”</p><p class="long">Have you ever seen someone wearing a skullcap that sits toward the back of the head? That's a yarmulke. A yarmulke is worn by Orthodox Jews all the time and other Jews on religious occasions. During a Jewish prayer service, many people will be wearing yarmulkes. The yarmulke signifies great respect for the Jewish faith. If you see someone wearing a yarmulke on the street, you know they're devoted to the Jewish religion. The Hebrew name for <i>yarmulke</i> is <i>kippah</i>.</p></div></div>`;
