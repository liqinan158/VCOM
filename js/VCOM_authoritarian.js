The connection between <i>authoritarian</i> and <i>master</i> is obvious enough, and you can think of an author as the master of the fictional world she creates. <i>Authoritarian</i> is also an adjective.  That teacher with the rule against dull pencils?  You can use the noun form to say that she's an authoritarian, or you can use an adjective and skip the "an": "She's authoritarian."</p></div></div>`;
