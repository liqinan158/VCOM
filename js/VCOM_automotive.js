var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">automotive</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Anything <i>automotive</i> has to do with automobiles — in other words, cars. The <i>automotive</i> industry, for example, is all about making and selling cars. If the windshield wipers fall off your car, get new ones at an <i>automotive</i> store.</p><p class="long">The word <i>automotive</i> comes from the Greek <i>auto</i> for “self” and <i>motive</i> for “moving," which makes sense for what the word may have meant in the late 1800s — a self-propelled helicopter-like machine for one person. Don’t bother looking for one of those, though, <i>automotive</i> now just refers to car stuff. If you're interested in automotive technology, you might become a mechanic. Or maybe you could figure out how to make one of those little helicopters.</p></div>`;
