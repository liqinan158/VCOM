You might also describe getting a filling at the dentist as universally disliked, or a brilliant sunny day as universally cheering after a week of rain. The root is Latin, the word <i>universalis</i>, "of or belonging to all," which in turn comes from <i>universus</i>, "whole or entire." When a feeling or belief belongs to everyone, everywhere, it is held universally.</p></div></div>`;
