It describes things that inspire wonder, like a wondrous imaginary land or a wondrous display of beautiful, elaborate cakes at a pastry shop. The root is the Old English <i>wundor</i>, "marvelous thing, or object of astonishment." <i>Wondrous</i> is tricky to spell because it's missing the <i>e</i> in <i>wonder</i>.</p></div></div>`;
