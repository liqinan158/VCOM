If you were hurrying out to the pasture to visit your favorite cow, you might <i>vault</i> over the gate in your excitement.</p><p class="long">When you support yourself with your hands as you jump over some hurdle, you vault, just as a gymnast might do across a vault â€” a piece of gymnastic equipment made to be vaulted over after a running start. Another meaning of <i>vault</i> is the arched roof of a building, or something that resembles such an archway. A storage chamber, especially one that's kept underground, is also a vault, like a bank vault.</p></div></div>`;
