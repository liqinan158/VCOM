There are few things more likely to cause <i>frustration</i> for an impatient driver than rush hour traffic.</p><p class="long">When you can't get what you want, or you're stuck in some way, you'll experience frustration. A spelling bee competitor who almost wins will feel frustration. The thing that causes you to feel this way can also be called a frustration â€” like your moody sister, the frustration of your home life. <i>Frustration</i> comes from the Latin <i>frustrationem</i>, "a deception or a disappointment."</p></div>`;
