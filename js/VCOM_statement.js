If you witness an accident, you make a <i>statement</i> to police, describing what you saw. You get a <i>statement</i> from your bank, a monthly record of what you spent and what you have left. Sometimes a statement isn't so official — it's just some kind of point being made. People say someone's car makes a statement — or their clothes do. Running away on your wedding day would make a huge statement.</p></div>`;
