Marinating kale, roasting it with olive oil and salt, and throwing it in a stir fry are all great ways to make kale tasty. Long ago, <i>kale</i> was also a slang term for "money," as in, "Hand over the <i>kale</i>, sweetheart, and nobody gets hurt." <i>Kale</i> comes from a Scottish variation on <i>cole</i>, which meant "cabbage" in Middle English.</p></div>`;
