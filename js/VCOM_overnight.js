An <i>overnight</i> party can also be called a sleepover or a slumber party. (Pack your sleeping bag, but you probably won't use it.)</p><p class="long">You can use <i>overnight</i> as an adverb or adjective literally meaning "during the night" â€” like an overnight airplane flight or a guest who stays overnight on your couch. You can also use it figuratively, to mean "quickly" or "instant." After you publish your first book, you may be an overnight success; and after an important election, the world may seem to change overnight.</p></div>`;
