An <i>unexpected</i> knock on your front door might make you jump.</p><p class="long">When you don't anticipate something, and have no clue that it's coming, you can call it <i>unexpected</i>. A successful surprise party is always unexpected, and an unexpected visitor can be exciting or inconvenient, depending on who it is. If you <i>expect</i> an event, you know it's going to occur, but if it's <i>unexpected</i>, it seems to come from nowhere. The Latin root is <i>expectare</i>, "await, look out for, desire, or hope."</p></div></div>`;
