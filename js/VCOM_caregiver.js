If you make sure your ailing friend eats every day and is relatively comfortable, you are her <i>caregiver</i>.</p><p class="long">Being a caregiver is sometimes a paying job â€” a home health aid and a nurse in a hospital both work as caregivers. When a family member is ill, you may become a temporary caregiver, bringing hot soup and warm blankets. In Britain, this person is called a <i>carer</i>. Both words come from the Old English <i>carian</i>, "to feel concern" and also "to grieve."</p></div>`;
