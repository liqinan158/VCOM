His style of music, which we call <i>bluegrass </i>today, probably got its name from the name of his band, the <i>Blue Grass Boys</i>, which was in turn named after his home state of Kentucky, the Bluegrass State. Bluegrass is similar to other country music with the exception of tempo: it's much faster. This makes bluegrass popular as dance music: bluegrass makes you want to move your feet.</p></div></div>`;
