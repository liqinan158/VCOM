An extreme love of a word, though, can veer into onomatomania. If the word you're obsessed with is <i>susurrous</i>, which means "whispering or hissing," you might note the susurrous sound of the wind in the trees and the susurrous noise of the steaming tea kettle. <i>Onomatomania</i> can also mean "fear of a word" or "frustration at not being able to think of a word."</p></div>`;
