Fun fact: your large <i>intestine</i> is about five feet long. Makes you wonder why they don't call it your "long <i>intestine</i>" instead.</p><p class="long">The human intestine is split into two sections: the small intestine and the large intestine. Your intestine's job is to continue breaking down the food you've eaten and absorb nutrients into your bloodstream. <i>Intestine</i> comes from the Latin word <i>intestinum</i>, "gut" or "bowels," which is the neuter form of the adjective <i>intestinus</i>, "inward" or "internal."</p></div></div>`;
