Martini-drinking, globe-trotting, and womanizing aside, let us not forget his primary role as a government secret agent â€” collecting intelligence and bringing down the world's enemies.</p><p class="long">As a noun, <i>operative</i> is often used as a synonym for <i>spy</i>. It can also, less covertly, be used to name a skilled worker, as in "No one aligns gears better than Joe, an <i>operative</i> at the car factory." As an adjective, <i>operative</i> can mean that something is working, as in "an <i>operative</i> car alarm." Finally, <i>operative</i> can mean "the most important or effective word." James Bond is a fictional operative, and the operative word in that statement is <i>fictional</i>.</p></div>`;
