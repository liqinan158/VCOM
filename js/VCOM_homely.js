It's almost always used to describe a less-than-attractive person, and occasionally an animal. If you were British, you'd use <i>homely</i> to mean "cozy and homelike," but in the United States you'd say "<i>homey</i>". Be careful not to confuse <i>homey</i> with <i>homely</i>, or you could accidentally hurt someone's feelings.</p></div>`;
