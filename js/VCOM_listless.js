If a fever has made you feel <i>listless</i>, you might also feel like you are melting into the sofa.</p><p class="long">If you went to the supermarket without your shopping list, that doesn't mean you're listless. The word originates from the Middle English word <i>liste</i> which meant desire (and is related to our word <i>lust</i>). Oddly enough, <i>listen</i> comes from the same origin. If you're too lethargic and out of it to listen, you're listless. It's not just laziness, it's not just fatigue; an utter indifference to whatever is going on around you makes you listless.</p></div></div>`;
