Your team's 100-point loss in the dodgeball tournament could be called a <i>drubbing</i>. Ouch.</p><p class="long">When one team soundly beats another, that's a drubbing. You can also use this word for a more literal kind of beating, actually physically striking someone: "My brother threatened to give that bully a drubbing if he keeps teasing me." The word comes from the verb <i>drub</i>, "to beat," probably from the Arabic root <i>daraba</i>, "he beat up."</p></div>`;
