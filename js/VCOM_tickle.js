It's impossible to <i>tickle</i> yourselfâ€”you can only <i>tickle</i> others.</p><p class="long">You might tickle a baby to make him squeal and giggle, and the sensation he feels is also called a tickle. An itching sensation is also sometimes referred to as a tickle, like a tickle in your throat when you're getting sick. Colloquially, you can tickle someone (or tickle them pink) by delighting them: "It tickles me when you surprise me with cupcakes!" Some experts suspect that this word comes from the Scots <i>kittle</i>, "to tickle."</p></div></div>`;
