When you're planning to build one of your famously elaborate sandcastles on the beach, you probably make sure the sand is <i>even</i> before you start.</p><p class="long">Something smooth and regular, like a wall that's prepped for painting, is even. <i>Even</i> also describes a balance like when you give all the kids an even amount of candy, or something that is calm, like a person who has an even temper. In math, an even number is one that can be divided by two without a remainder. The adverb <i>even</i> is used to emphasize something, like when your friend doesn't even see you waving frantically at her.</p></div>`;
