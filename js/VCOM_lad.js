A man who's been hit with a water balloon might turn around to a group of giggling boys and ask, "All right, which of you <i>lads</i> did that?"</p><p class="long">You can use the casual <i>lad</i> instead of <i>guy</i>, <i>fellow</i>, or <i>chap</i>. This word is much more common in Britain than in the U.S., although everyone understands what it means. Someone in London might talk about going out on the town with "the <i>lads</i>," while in Boston people are more likely to say they're meeting "the <i>guys</i>." <i>Lad</i>, originally spelled <i>ladde</i>, first meant "foot soldier," or "young servant."</p></div>`;
