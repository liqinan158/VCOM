It's also a noun for a large pile of stuff for burning. Most times a <i>pyre</i> is part of a funeral â€” the body is burned on it.</p><p class="long">From the Greek <i>pura</i> or <i>pur</i>, meaning "fire," <i>pyre</i> came into English in the 17th century. <i>Pyr</i> is also the Czech word for "hot ashes." Remember, a pyre isn't the fire itself but the stuff that helps the fire burn, as firewood at a campfire. People and animals are burned on a pyre as part of a traditional funeral ceremony in some countries.</p></div>`;
