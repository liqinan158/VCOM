If you are wearing a <i>discreet</i> gray suit, it is unlikely that anyone at that business meeting will notice you.</p><p class="long">Often people use <i>discreet</i> not only to indicate modesty or carefulness, but also to show a sort of secretiveness along the lines of “You're going to keep this a secret, right?” If no one in your family knows that you like to dress up as a bear, but then your cousin finds out, you may ask him to please be discreet.</p></div></div>`;
