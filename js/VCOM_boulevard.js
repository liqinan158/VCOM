You can get to school by taking the four-lane <i>boulevard</i>, but to avoid all the traffic, you might use the less-traveled side streets.</p><p class="long">A boulevard is a street or avenue, especially one that's very wide and lined with trees. Many boulevards have a median strip of grass and sometimes trees. <i>Boulevard strip</i> is the regional term for a patch of grass between a curb and a sidewalk, which in other places is called a <i>tree lawn</i>. The French word <i>boulevard</i> literally means "rampart," or "defensive embankment." Later it was adapted to mean "a promenade beside a rampart."</p></div>`;
