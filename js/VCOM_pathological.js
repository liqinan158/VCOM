Anyone who studies or works with diseases, from their causes to their symptoms, identifies how the disease affects its victims, in other words, its <i>pathological</i> effects. Remember that this is a medical distinction. If a person has, for example, obsessive-compulsive disorder, his or her repetitive actions are pathological.</p></div></div>`;
