If you want to <i>depress</i> the spread of poverty, you need to find ways to slow it down, like by bringing education and skill-building resources into the poorest communities.</p><p class="long">The word <i>depress</i> comes from the Old French word <i>depresser</i>, meaning "put down by force." <i>Depress</i> can be used literally to describe something you push down, like when you depress the handle on a toaster to lower the bread. It can also describe a more figurative lowering, such as the lowering of a person's emotional state. Attending a funeral is likely to depress you, and watching a sad movie afterwards will just sink your spirits even more.</p></div>`;
