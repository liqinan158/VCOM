You'll want to wear your tall rubber boots if you're going to walk through the <i>slop</i> on the way to the bus stop.</p><p class="long">Farmers feed their pigs slop, a messy, wet mix of various leftoversâ€”and when they do, they can say they slop the pigs. A derogatory way to talk about food that doesn't look very tasty is to call it <i>slop</i>. And you can call sticky, overly sentimental music, writing, or films <i>slop</i> as well. The 15th century definition of <i>slop</i> was "mudhole," from the Old English <i>cusloppe</i>, "cow dung."</p></div>`;
