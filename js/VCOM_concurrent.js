While <i>current</i> refers to something that is happening right now, <i>concurrent</i> describes two or more things happening at the same time. A prisoner who is serving two concurrent five-year sentences will serve those prison terms together, meaning that he'll probably get out of jail in five years rather than ten. To help you remember the meaning of <i>concurrent</i>, imagine two parallel kayaks being carried down a river by the current at the same time.</p></div>`;
