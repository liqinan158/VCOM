Among other things, a <i>transcendentalist</i> sees humans and nature as inherently good.</p><p class="long">Transcendentalism became popular in mid-1800s New England, when many transcendentalists felt unhappy with the current state of society. Some famous transcendentalists include Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, both of whom wrote about the transcendentalist beliefs in the importance of each individual's self-reliance. Most transcendentalists were vegetarians and had progressive views on women's rights. The word itself comes from the Latin <i>transcendere</i>, "climb over or beyond."</p></div>`;
