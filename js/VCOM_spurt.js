Though a jet of liquid is usually what spurts, the word is also used for quick bursts of speed, like a race car that spurts forward suddenly, winning at the last second. The origin of <i>spurt</i> isn't certain, but it may be related to the German <i>spürzen</i>, "to spit" and <i>sprützen</i>, "to squirt."</p></div>`;
