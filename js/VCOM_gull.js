Those are <i>gulls</i>, also known as sea gulls. <i>Gulls</i> are found in every continent, including Antarctica.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>gull</i> has two very distinct definitions. Gulls are shore birds, of course, but lesser-used meaning of the word is "a person who is easy to fool." Your little brother might be a gull if you can trick him into doing your chores along with his own. You may know the related word <i>gullible</i>, which describes a willingness to believe anything, without questioning whether it is true.</p></div>`;
