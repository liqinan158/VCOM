If you've been trying to break your sugar habit but one day eat several pieces of cake, that's <i>regression</i>.</p><p class="long">Remember that the suffix <i>-ion</i> is added to a verb to make it into a noun, making <i>regression</i> the noun form of the verb "to regress." We can find <i>regression</i>, meaning "the act of going back,"   as far back as the late 1300s, from the Latin <i>regressus</i>, which means "a return."  When you see all your old  friends (and enemies) at a school reunion, you might experience regression and start acting like your younger self.</p></div>`;
