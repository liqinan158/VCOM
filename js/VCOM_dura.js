The dura is particularly important because it keeps the fluid that cushions your brain in place. An injury to the dura means the possibility that this fluid might leak. An injury known as a subdural hematoma is almost like a bruise that occurs just beneath the dura. In Latin, <i>dura</i> means "hard or thick."</p></div></div>`;
