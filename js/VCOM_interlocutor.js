If you and your friend are in an argument and aren't speaking, a third friend could act as an <i>interlocutor</i>, delivering messages back and forth.</p><p class="long"><i>Interlocutor</i> traces back to the Latin word <i>interloqui</i>, meaning “to speak between.” We use <i>interlocutor</i> either for "a conversation partner," or for "a third party in a conversation," like a middleman who speaks on behalf of an organization. It's also an old term for the guy in a minstrel show who questions all the other performers as a way of moving the act forward. "What's that you say? A funky dance? Go on and show us then."</p></div></div>`;
