Southern writers love a pale blue and white <i>seersucker</i> suit in the summertime because it pairs well with sweet tea, Spanish moss, and croquet.</p><p class="long">Seersucker comes in many colors and is occasionally checkered, although it usually has stripes over a white background. British colonists in India were the first English-speakers to wear seersucker. They also anglicized the name from the Hindi <i>sirsakar</i>, which comes from the Persian <i>šir o šakar</i>, "striped cloth," or literally, "milk and sugar," referring to the cloth's alternation of smoothness and puckered surface.</p></div>`;
