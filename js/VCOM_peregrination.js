A <i>peregrination</i> is a long journey or period of wandering.</p><p class="long"><i>Peregrination</i> comes from the Latin <i>peregrinari</i>, which means “to travel abroad.” A peregrination is a journey or pilgrimage, especially one that's made on foot. This word typically applies to traveling for an extended period of time or over a great distance. So, you wouldn’t call a trip to the grocery store a peregrination. However, if you traveled the globe looking for the world’s best grocery store, you could call that a peregrination.</p></div>`;
