He put together the Greek <i>nostos</i> "homecoming" and <i>algos</i> "pain, distress" as a literal translation of the German <i>Heimweh</i> "homesickness." Originally, it was a medical diagnosis for mercenary soldiers. Today, it describes a bittersweet longing for the past. Think of the dreamy way your grandpa tells stories of his childhood â€” he's got nostalgia.</p></div>`;
