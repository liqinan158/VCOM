Your favorite <i>animal</i> might be the naked mole rat, but probably not.</p><p class="long">Although a human is biologically an animal, the word often distinguishes humans from other kinds of animals, like when scientists talk about diseases passing from animals to people. Sometimes the word <i>animal</i> means a cruel, violent, or uncivilized person: "He just destroyed my house at the party last night â€” what an <i>animal</i>!" The Latin word for "soul," <i>anima</i>, led to <i>animale</i>, or "living being, a being that breathes." Before 1500, the word "beast" was much more commonly used than <i>animal</i>.</p></div>`;
