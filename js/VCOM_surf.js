It’s also what you do when you ride those waves. <i>Surf’s</i> up, dude!</p><p class="long"><i>Surf</i> means "crashing waves," but it's also a verb meaning to ride those waves with a surf board. When you surf, you stand upright on a board and ride over breaking waves into the shore. A more figurative meaning of <i>surf</i> is "search casually," as in "channel <i>surf</i>," or click idly between TV stations. The origin of the word is a mystery, though it's thought to have first been used in reference to the Indian coast.</p></div></div>`;
