In fact, a <i>thrust</i> refers to a sharp blow or stab. Violence aside, <i>thrust</i> can be any kind of forceful push or driving force. Aggressive street vendors thrust their wares on you and young movie stars are thrust into the limelight at an early age â€” which may be disconcerting, but certainly is not as frightening a knife thrust in your direction.</p></div></div>`;
