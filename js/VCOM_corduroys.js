When jeans seem a little bit too casual, you might decide to wear your orange <i>corduroys</i> instead.</p><p class="long">Corduroys are often cut exactly like jeans, the only difference being in the cloth from which they're made â€” corduroy instead of denim. Both fabrics are traditionally woven from cotton, but corduroy's twisted fibers, or cords, form a ridged, raised pattern you can feel with your fingertips. It's commonly said the word comes from the French <i>corde du roi</i>, "cord of the king," though experts aren't convinced of this source.</p></div>`;
