A twelve year-old might <i>idolize</i> a pop star, for example, wallpapering her bedroom with photos of him and screaming loudly throughout his concerts.</p><p class="long">You can idolize someone you've never met, like a famous actor, and you can also idolize a friend or family member. A boy who idolizes his father adores him unquestioningly, believing that everything he does is admirable. Another way to say <i>idolize</i> is <i>worship</i>, and both words have a religious origin. In the case of <i>idolize</i>, the root word is <i>idol</i>, or "image of a god used in worship," from the Late Latin word <i>idolum</i>, "image or form."</p></div></div>`;
