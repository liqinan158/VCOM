Your <i>primness</i> might keep you sitting politely on the sofa during the party, instead of running around blowing noisemakers with the other guests.</p><p class="long">Someone who's <i>prim</i> is extremely respectable and particular, often frowning in disapproval at other people. This quality is <i>primness</i>. The primness of your new teacher's face on the first day of school may give you a clue about how much fun the year will be â€” despite the appearance of primness, however, your teacher may surprise you by throwing frequent pizza parties. The Latin root, <i>primus</i>, means "finest."</p></div></div>`;
