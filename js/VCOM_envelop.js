The Snuggie Blanket is so popular because it <i>envelops</i> your body, leaving only your head uncovered. Sure, it looks dorky, but it keeps you extra warm.</p><p class="long">You probably noticed that <i>envelop</i> looks just like the noun <i>envelope</i>, minus that last letter "e", and that's an easy way to help you remember its meaning, too. Picture what an envelope does â€” it seals a letter completely inside, or envelops it. <i>Envelop</i> can also be used in a symbolic way, to describe something that consumes or occupies your mind. If the pretty girl you just met starts to <i>envelop</i> your thoughts, your work will suffer because you can't concentrate. <i>Envelop</i> comes from the late 14c. word <i>envolupen,</i> meaning "be involved in."</p></div>`;
