If you express no emotion and do things in an automatic-seeming way, your friends might say you're <i>robotic</i>.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>robotic</i> can describe something related to the use of robots, like a robotic technique for dismantling a bomb or a robotic tool for surgery. Often, it's used to describe a person who reminds you of a robot: "She gets good grades, but she's so <i>robotic</i>! All she does is work â€” never has any fun!" Science fiction writer Isaac Asimov is credited with the first use of <i>robotic</i> in 1941.</p></div>`;
