It can also be a literary work based on imagination rather than on fact, like a novel or short story.</p><p class="long">The Latin word <i>fictus</i> means “to form,” which seems like a good source for the English word <i>fiction,</i> since fiction is formed in the imagination. Like its literary cousins <i>fable,</i> <i>legend,</i> and <i>myth,</i> however, <i>fiction</i> has a slightly darker additional meaning: a deliberate lie or untruth. When we talk about "the line between fact and fiction," we're talking about the difference between truth and lies.</p></div></div>`;
