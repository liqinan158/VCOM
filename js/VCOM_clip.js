Think of when you clip your dog's toenails or clip the dangling ends off the blanket you're knitting. You can also use the verb <i>clip</i> for a figurative kind of cutting, like when you clip two minutes off your marathon time or clip your words — say them quickly and tensely — when you're angry.</p></div>`;
