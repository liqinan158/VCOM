But in slang it's an insult usually hurled at slimy, stupid men.</p><p class="long">This is an extremely popular word. Many people seem to see douche bags everywhere they look. Despite how commonly <i>douche bag</i> is used, it is considered an inappropriate word in most settings. Parents and teachers certainly don't want to hear about how you think your brother is a douche bag. Be careful who you call a <i>douche bag</i>: in many cases, it will be safer to call them a jerk or idiot instead.</p></div>`;
