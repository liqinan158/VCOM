If you place things here and there, at intervals or leaving room between each item, you intersperse them. The Latin root is <i>interspersus</i>, "strewn or scattered," and in the mid-1500s the word <i>intersperse</i> was used mostly to mean "diversify by introducing things at intervals."</p></div></div>`;
