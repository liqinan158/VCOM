var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">tempt</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>tempt</i> is to lure or entice. You might <i>tempt</i> your runaway dog back inside with pieces of cheese.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>tempt</i> often has negative implications: "Don't let those bullies <i>tempt</i> you into picking on smaller kids!" When something tempts you, it's often with the knowledge that it's not the best idea, however attractive it might be. <i>Tempt</i> was originally a religious term, meaning "to entice to evil or sin," while today it's more likely to be a slice of cake that tempts us than the devil.</p></div>`;
