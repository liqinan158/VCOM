A bodybuilder or weightlifter is distinctive not only for his huge arms, but for his big, muscular <i>chest</i>.</p><p class="long">The character Tarzan is known for thumping his own chest while yelling — but if Tarzan gets a bad cold, he might cough so hard that his chest aches. Another kind of chest is a storage box with a connected lid that swings open. This is the oldest meaning of <i>chest</i>, from the Old English <i>cest</i>, "box or casket." The anatomical meaning comes from the idea that the ribs form a "box" — or a chest — around the internal organs.</p></div>`;
