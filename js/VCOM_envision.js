Kids often <i>envision</i> themselves doing exciting things when they grow up, like being movie stars, professional athletes, or astronauts.</p><p class="long">The word <i>envision</i> comes from the Latin <i>en-</i>, which means "cause to be," and <i>visionem</i>, meaning "a thing seen." Career paths aren't the only things that can be envisioned. If you envision a cleaner world, you may volunteer to pick up trash on the beach. If you envision a more peaceful world, you might make your brother and sister play in separate rooms to stop them from screaming at each other.</p></div></div>`;
