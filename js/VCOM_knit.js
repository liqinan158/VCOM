Knitting involves different kinds of stitches or consecutive loops that you create in rows.</p><p class="long">The verb is derived from the Old English <i>cnyttan,</i> meaning “to tie with a knot, bind or fasten.” While knitting can also be completed with a machine, many people knit hats, scarves, and mittens as a hobby. <i>Knit</i> can also mean “entwine.” Two ideas or concepts can be knit together, and it could be said that a marriage knits two people together. Note that the ‘k’ at the beginning is silent.</p></div>`;
