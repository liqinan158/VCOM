var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">spoof</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>spoof</i> is a funny version of something, like a movie or a book. The classic comedy "Young Frankenstein" is a <i>spoof</i> of earlier, serious film adaptations of the famous novel.</p><p class="long">You can also call a spoof a <i>parody</i>. A spoof borrows material from the original, copying the style and characteristics that make it obvious what the subject of the spoof is. Movies like "Spaceballs," a spoof of the "Star Wars" films, and "Scary Movie," which spoofs the entire horror film genre, are great examples. <i>Spoof</i> originally meant "hoax," and it comes from a game, <i>Spouf</i>, invented by a British comedian in 1884.</p></div>`;
