The Latin root <i>religio</i> means “to bind,” and religion binds people together not just by their practices, but also by their ideas.  Most religions have their own story about the creation of the universe, and each has a different explanation for the meaning of life, which is a source of comfort for a religion’s followers.</p></div></div>`;
