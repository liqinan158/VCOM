When someone says something completely ridiculous, call it a bunch of <i>baloney</i>. If your friend tells you a unicorn on roller skates ate the last cookie, tell her she’s full of <i>baloney</i>!</p><p class="long">The word <i>baloney</i> comes from the sandwich meat called <i>bologna</i>, which is typically made of leftover scraps of meat. Around 1920, <i>baloney</i> came to mean "nonsense," and it was also used to describe an unskilled boxer. Use it to describe utter nonsense, not necessarily evil lies, but just words that mean nothing. A politician who spouts clichés but really says nothing is full of baloney, and so is a pretentious artist or a pompous showoff.</p></div></div>`;
