When you milk a cow, you empty its <i>udder</i> by squeezing the milk into a bucket. Moo!</p><p class="long">To milk any four-legged ruminant, you need to carefully squeeze and pull each teat after cleaning the udder. Large dairy farmers use machines to do this, while some smaller ones do it by hand. Female cattle, goats, deer, and sheep all produce milk and have udders, organs in their bodies that contain mammary glands.</p></div>`;
