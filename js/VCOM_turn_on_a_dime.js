Your neighbor's huge SUV may be powerful, but it can't <i>turn on a dime</i> like your tiny Smart car.</p><p class="long">When you literally have a very small turning radius, you can turn on a dime, whether you're on foot or in a speed boat. This phrase is also commonly used figuratively, to mean instantly change focus or switch abruptly to something new. Your older sister might talk pleasantly about her day for a while, only to turn on a dime and suddenly demand to know if you borrowed her bike without asking.</p></div></div>`;
