Francis Beaumont implores us to know that “the world’s a <i>snare</i>.” And Hilda Doolittle asserts that “a <i>snare</i> is Love.” Still Soren Kierkegaard lets us know that “the truth is a <i>snare</i>: you cannot have it, without being caught.” Whoever is right, it seems that you can’t escape. A <i>snare</i> is also a type of small drum that rattles, as well as a wire loop used by surgeons.</p></div></div>`;
