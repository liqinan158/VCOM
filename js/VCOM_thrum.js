If you and your friends all play the guitar, it may be fun sometimes to sit around and <i>thrum</i> together, improvising tunes.</p><p class="long">This word can also be used as a noun, to describe the kind of melodic hum that guitar strings make when you strum them. So you might say you found your way back to the campsite by following the thrum of your mom's mandolin, or that you love the thrum of rain on the metal roof of your grandparents' house. <i>Thrum</i>, like <i>strum</i> and <i>hum</i>, is imitative, mimicking the sound it describes.</p></div></div>`;
