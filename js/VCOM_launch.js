You can <i>launch</i> a rocket, a career, a product or even a watermelon. Either way, you're getting it off the ground.</p><p class="long"><i>Launch</i> often means to start something, but to start it in a big way: "The launch of the shuttle was also the launch of a new era in space travel." Time was, when a singer finished making her record, the company would simply "release it." Eventually, though, that wasn't enough. Now a record needs "a launch" â€” a full-scale media blitz to get people excited enough to buy it.</p></div>`;
