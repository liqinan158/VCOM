var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">collapsible</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Something that can be folded down into a manageable size is said to be <i>collapsible</i>, i.e., able to be <i>collapsed</i>. It is used as an adjective, as in "He folded up the <i>collapsible</i> table and put it in his car."</p><p class="long"><i>Collapsible</i> is formed from the verb <i>collapse</i>, which comes from the Latin <i>collƒÅpsus</i>, "fallen together." This makes sense, since something that is <i>collapsible</i> "falls" into a tighter, more compact size or shape. Of course, anything that is able to fall can be considered <i>collapsible</i>, but the word refers more to something that is intentionally made to fall, rather than something like a rickety building that might collapse.</p></div>`;
