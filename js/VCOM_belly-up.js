The same term can be used for financial failures, like a store that goes out of business due to poor sales or a company that makes bad investments and has to fold. People use the term for other sorts of failures too: a sports team that misses the playoffs has gone belly-up. A failed dream has gone belly-up. Anything belly-up is finished.</p></div>`;
