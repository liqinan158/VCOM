The non-bag type of purse is usually associated with sporting events: boxers and jockeys win purses. Other times, <i>purse</i> is used to describe money won in another context, like a photography contest. Another meaning is totally different: if you pucker or contract your lips, you're pursing them.</p></div></div>`;
