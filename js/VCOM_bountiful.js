We celebrate the idea of a <i>bountiful</i> harvest with a Thanksgiving cornucopia overflowing with its bounty of pumpkins, apples, squashes, and cranberries.</p><p class="long"><i>Bountiful</i> can also mean generously given, with the idea that the original <i>bounty</i> of a harvest came from the gods you prayed to for rain and sun. When you received their gifts, you thanked them for their generosity. Now, bountiful giving is something you might experience with your parents or grandparents, happy just to see you smile on your birthday.</p></div>`;
