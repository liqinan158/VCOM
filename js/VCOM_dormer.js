The word <i>dormer</i> often refers to the window itself.</p><p class="long">A dormer, with roots in the French <i>dormir</i> (“to sleep”), often extends from an upstairs bedroom. The word has a sense of old-fashioned charm about it. Though you may occasionally still see a face peeking out from a dormer, the word brings to mind old stories such as the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale, “The Snow Queen”: “They each had a little <i>dormer</i> window, and one only had to step over the gutter to get from one house to the other.”</p></div></div>`;
