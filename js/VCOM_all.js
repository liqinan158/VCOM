When Shakespeare writes, in <i>As You Like It</i>, “<i>All</i> the world's a stage,” he means the whole world. When I ask, “Did you eat <i>all</i> of the pie?” I mean, “Is there a piece left for me?”. If you are "<i>all</i> upset" about something, you are very upset; what's upset you has got a hold of you. Would some pie cheer you up?</p></div></div>`;
