Your family might have a Saturday night <i>ritual</i> of eating a big spaghetti dinner and then taking a long walk to the ice cream shop.</p><p class="long">As an adjective, <i>ritual</i> means "conforming to religious rites," which are the sacred, customary ways of celebrating a religion or culture. Different communities have different ritual practices, like meditation in Buddhism, or baptism in Christianity. We also call the ceremony itself a ritual. Although it comes from religious ceremonies, <i>ritual</i> can also be used for any time-honored tradition, like the Superbowl, or Mardi Gras, or Sunday morning pancake breakfast.</p></div>`;
