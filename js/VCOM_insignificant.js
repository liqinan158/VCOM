The fact that your mom gets to school a half hour late becomes <i>insignificant</i> when she announces you're stopping for ice cream on the way home.</p><p class="long">The word <i>signify</i>, which is at the heart of <i>insignificant</i>, means "to mean." <i>Significant</i> means "meaningful." Add <i>in-</i> "not," and you have "not meaningful." A company can fire a worker from an insignificant job and still function. In a crisis, your feelings are insignificant; it is your actions that matter.</p></div>`;
