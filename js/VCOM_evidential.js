The receipt for the stolen blue suede shoes would be <i>evidential</i> proof of what you paid for the shoes when you bought them from the Elvis estate.</p><p class="long">Often used as a legal term, <i>evidential</i> is sometimes paired with the words "proof," "burden," or "hearing." Like many legal words, this one comes from medieval Latin (in this case, <i>evidentialis</i>). Lop off the last two letters and you have the English word. If a Roman took an Englishman to court for lopping at the words in his language, though, he'd need to show some evidential proof that the Englishman was guilty.</p></div>`;
