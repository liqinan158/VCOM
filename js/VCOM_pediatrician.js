When a sick child goes to visit the <i>pediatrician</i>, often there are toys and other things to play with in the waiting room.</p><p class="long">The word <i>pediatrician</i> has only been in use since the turn of the 20th century. Some people also use the word <i>pediatrist</i> to mean the same thing â€” a doctor who specializes in treating children ranging from newborn babies to adolescents. Pediatricians study pediatrics, both of which stem from a form of the Greek <i>pais</i> "children." The remainder of the word comes from the Greek <i>iatros</i> "healer."</p></div>`;
