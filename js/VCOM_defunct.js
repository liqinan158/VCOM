A magazine that no longer publishes, like <i>Sassy</i>, the girl-power mag from the '90s, is <i>defunct</i>, for example.</p><p class="long">Although <i>defunct</i> comes from the Latin word <i>defunctus</i> meaning "dead," it's not usually used to describe a person who's no longer with us, but rather institutions, projects, companies and political parties â€” you know, the boring stuff. Keep digging and you'll find that <i>defunctus</i> comes from <i>defungi</i>, meaning, "to finish," which is closer to how it's used today. <i>Defunct</i> can also refer to a rule or law that's no longer used or has become inactive, like prohibition.</p></div>`;
