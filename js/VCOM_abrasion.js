An <i>abrasion</i> can happen to a person, as in a skinned knee, or to an object, as in what you get when you apply sandpaper to wood.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>abrasion</i> comes to us from the Latin <i>abradere</i>, which means “scrape away” or “shave off.” Any area that shows evidence of scratching or scraping can be called an abrasion, like that spot on the front bumper of your car from when you cut it too close pulling into the gas station. <i>Abrasion</i> can also mean the process of friction causing scratches, as in: "the <i>abrasion</i> of everyone sliding chairs on the floor left terrible marks."</p></div></div>`;
