In other words, they really, really don't like it.</p><p class="long">When you think of <i>abhorrent</i>, think of <i>horror,</i> as in something so vile and loathsome that you can only react to it in horror. In fact, the word <i>abhorrent</i> in Latin means “to recoil (back away) in horror.” Note that the ending is spelled <i>-ent</i> with an <i>e,</i> not an <i>a</i>. Maybe the <i>a</i> found <i>abhorrent</i> so abhorrent that it didn’t want to appear in it a second time.</p></div></div>`;
