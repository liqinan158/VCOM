It can also refer to a material that sticks to other things.  While the first meaning comes from the 15th century, the reference to a sticky substance didn't emerge until the 16th. In all cases, the word comes from the Latin root <i>haerÄ“re</i> "stick," connected to the prefix <i>ad-</i> "to," making the word mean "to stick to."</p></div></div>`;
