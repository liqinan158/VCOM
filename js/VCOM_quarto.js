Bestselling books are not usually published as <i>quartos</i> these days, but you might find an old Shakespearean text this size.</p><p class="long">Use the noun <i>quarto</i> to talk about a book that uses this same basic folded design. Each page of a quarto is one-fourth the size of the original sheet of paper, which is where its name comes from: the Medieval Latin <i>in quarto</i> means "in the fourth (of a sheet of paper)." <i>Quarto</i> also refers to a book of this size, or a piece of paper that measures ten by eight inches.</p></div>`;
