Your porch light <i>shines</i> at night, and if the sky is clear and cloudless, the moon will <i>shine</i> too.</p><p class="long">The sun and a light bulb both shine, and things that simply reflect light can be said to shine too, like a diamond ring or clean, glossy hair. In a more figurative way, people shine when they stand out for doing something extremely well: "The lead actress really <i>shines</i> in her role as Lady Macbeth." The Old English root of <i>shine</i> is <i>scinan</i>, which means "shed light, be radiant, or illuminate," and also "be conspicuous."</p></div></div>`;
