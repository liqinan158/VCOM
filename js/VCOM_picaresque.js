This kind of book first became popular in Spain in the 1500s. Well known authors, including Charles Dickens and Mark Twain, later used a picaresque style for some of their work. It's easy to confuse <i>picaresque</i>, "rascally," with its near sound-alike, <i>picturesque</i>, or "lovely to look at."</p></div></div>`;
