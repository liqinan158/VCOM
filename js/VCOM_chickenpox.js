It used to be common for almost every child to get <i>chickenpox</i> at some point.</p><p class="long">Today a vaccine protects kids from getting chickenpox â€” and though it's thought of as a mild childhood disease, it can be serious or even deadly. Once you've had chickenpox, or the series of shots, you're immune from getting it again. The origin of <i>chickenpox</i> is uncertain: it may come from the resemblance of the rash to tiny chickpeas, or chicken pecks. Alternately, the <i>chicken</i> may refer to "children," or be a contrast to the more serious <i>smallpox</i>.</p></div>`;
