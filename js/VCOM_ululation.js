In many cultures, the sound of <i>ululation</i> is common at a funeral, while in others the mourners only sniffle quietly.</p><p class="long">Ululation is often mournful and it's always full of emotion. It's a common cultural reaction to a death, as well as a highly expressive way of grieving. In some cases, ululation can be celebratory or joyful rather than sad. It's been used to mean "wailing" since the 16th century, and its origin traces back to the Latin word with that same meaning, <i>ululationem</i>.</p></div></div>`;
