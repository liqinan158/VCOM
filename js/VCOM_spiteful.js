You could deliberately hurt someone's feelings or embarrass them with your spiteful words, or you could watch a jealous child give her friend a spiteful shove. The Latin word <i>despectus</i>, or "scorn or contempt," became the English <i>despite</i>, later shortened to <i>spite</i>, or "a desire to hurt someone."</p></div>`;
