Consider <i>volleyball</i>, a game in which players use their arms and hands to hit a ball across a net, trying to keep the ball in the air. Teams score a point when the <i>volleyball</i> hits the floor on their opponent's side.</p><p class="long">There are two ways to play volleyball: in a gym and outside in the sand, a style known as beach volleyball. The indoor version requires six players per team, while the beach style has two players per side. Volleyball is a serious sport (it's even played in the Olympics), but you can also play for fun at a picnic or at the beach. Volleyball was invented in the late 1800s, right around the time basketball was first catching on.</p></div>`;
