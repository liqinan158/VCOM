This adverb comes from <i>unwitting</i> and its Old English root <i>unwitende</i>, "ignorant." <i>Wit</i> means "knowledge," so if you do something unwittingly, you act without knowledge. If you post too much personal information online, you might unwittingly set yourself up to have your identity stolen.</p></div>`;
