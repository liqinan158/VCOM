If you move into a house that already has a ghost, the ghost <i>predates</i> you. Boo!</p><p class="long">If your interest in soul music predates your sister's, you loved it first. When you use <i>predate</i> this way, you can read it as a combination of <i>pre-</i>, "before," and <i>date</i>, "point in time." Another meaning of this verb is "to prey on for food," so you could say that your cat predates the mice that live in your kitchen. This definition stems from <i>predator</i>, from the Latin <i>praedator</i>, "plunderer."</p></div>`;
