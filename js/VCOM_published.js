Books, newspaper stories, and magazine articles can all be described as <i>published</i>, but so can online content like an essay or a blog post, or even a photograph on social media. The adjective <i>published</i> comes from <i>publish</i>, "issue for public sale" or "make publicly known." In the fourteenth century, it also meant "disgrace or put to shame."</p></div></div>`;
