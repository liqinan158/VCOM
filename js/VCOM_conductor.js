var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">conductor</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A train <i>conductor</i> is the person who takes tickets, shouts "All aboard!" and might control the engine, while a musical <i>conductor</i> is the one who leads an orchestra. Same job title â€” not the same person.</p><p class="long">From the Latin root <i>conducere</i>, meaning "bring together," a conductor does just that. A music conductor makes sure all the musicians come in at the right time and tempo, and a train conductor brings together all of the passengers. Another type of conductor is something that passes on electricity or heat, like a metal spoon, a conductor of heat when left in a pot that's simmering on the stove.</p></div>`;
