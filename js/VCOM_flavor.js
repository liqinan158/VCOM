If an ice cream shop offers 50 <i>flavors</i>, each one of them will taste different.</p><p class="long">The flavor of your soup can be adjusted by adding salt â€” and when you add ingredients to change a food's taste, you can say you <i>flavor</i> it.  From the flavor of food comes the sense of <i>flavor</i> meaning "atmosphere" or "feeling." You could say, for example, that you're not crazy about a particular clothing shop because it has such a glitzy, expensive flavor. <i>Flavor</i> initially meant "smell," from the Vulgar Latin <i>flator</i>, "odor."</p></div></div>`;
