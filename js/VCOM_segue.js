Comedians have the same skill as they segue from one joke to another, and politicians also learn the art of the segue. So do teachers. This is also a term in music for moving from one part of a piece to another. Remember that <i>segue</i> does not sound quite how it looks: it's pronounced "SEG-way."</p></div></div>`;
