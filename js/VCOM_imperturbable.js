If your goal is to be <i>imperturbable</i>, then you can't let things bother you or get you stressed, confused, or angry.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>imperturbable</i> is the flip side of <i>perturbable</i>, which comes from <i>perturb</i>, which in turn traces back to the Latin word <i>perturbare</i>, meaning “to confuse” or “to disturb.” If something really annoying is going on, like one neighbor is jack-hammering his driveway and another has a dog that's barking while you're trying to sleep because you were up all night studying and you really really need a nap, but you stay calm and don’t get upset, you are imperturbable.</p></div>`;
