Aside from the fact that they’re completely real, they’re also <i>hirsute</i>: very, very hairy creatures.</p><p class="long">All mammals have hair, but the ones that have way more than others, you might call them hirsute.  There are hirsute people, like lumberjacks with a jungle of chest hair, bearded ladies at a circus, or just someone with a scraggly hairdo.  The word is pronounced “HER-suit,” so if you see a woman wearing a furry jacket with matching pants, you could say, “Her suit is <i>hirsute</i>.”  Just make sure it’s actually a suit and not her real hair.</p></div>`;
