If someone calls you a <i>magpie</i>, you should probably quiet down.</p><p class="long">The magpie is a distinctive looking bird, with glossy black and brilliant white markings. Its sound is nearly as striking, famously noisy and almost jarring. This has led to another meaning of <i>magpie</i>, "someone who talks obnoxiously." You might describe your chatterbox neighbor as a <i>magpie</i> â€” and the word itself comes from the nickname <i>Mag</i>, short for Margaret and commonly used in slang English to mean "idle chattering."</p></div>`;
