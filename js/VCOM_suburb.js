If you live in the <i>suburbs</i>, you probably travel to the city for work.</p><p class="long"><i>Suburb</i> comes from Latin: <i>sub</i> means "below or near" and <i>urbis</i> means "city." You also will recognize this root in <i>urban</i>. Suburbs have more single-family homes than apartment buildings, and living there, you are more likely to have a yard with trees and grass. The downside is, if you work in the city, you might have a long commute that adds to the time you are away from your family.</p></div></div>`;
