Drive through the countryside in mid-summer and you can often see whole fields full of <i>daisies</i>.</p><p class="long">Daisies grow wild in many places, and they're also cultivated in gardens as a perennial, a plant that returns year after year. One invasive variation is called a "lawn daisy" because it quickly and easily takes over grassy lawns and is notoriously hard to mow down. The word <i>daisy</i> comes from <i>day's eye</i>, an informal name that arose from the flower's habit of closing its petals when the sun goes down at the end of the day.</p></div></div>`;
