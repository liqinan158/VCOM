var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">sober</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">This adjective means the opposite of playful or drunk. When attending a funeral, you are expected to be <i>sober</i> in both senses.</p><p class="long">The most common meaning of <i>sober</i> is "not drunk" — people who drive need to be sober. <i>Sober</i> sounds a lot like somber, and it often means sad and quiet too, or sometimes too serious. Another meaning is to be logical or realistic about something. Sometimes <i>sober</i> means drab: a grey station wagon is a more <i>sober</i> vehicle than a hot red convertible. All of these meanings are quiet and restrained — unlike a person who has had a lot to drink.</p></div></div>`;
