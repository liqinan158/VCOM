Such as in a house, on a houseboat, or in an apartment? Then you have a domicile, or simply, housing. Or in the eyes of the law, your legal place of residence. You can turn <i>domicile</i> into a verb, and say that you are currently domiciled in the Caribbean â€” but you'd really only use that terminology if you were on trial for tax evasion.</p></div></div>`;
