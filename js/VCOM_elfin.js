Your grandmother might be especially proud of her little <i>elfin</i> feet.</p><p class="long">Small people and children are often described as having elfin faces, particularly if there's a mischievous spark in their eyes. If your friend's ears are unusually petite — and rather adorable — you can describe them as elfin. The word clearly comes from <i>elf</i>, and it's sometimes used to mean "relating to elves," though it more commonly means "tiny like an elf." Edmund Spenser first used the word <i>elfin</i> in his 1590 epic poem, "The Faerie Queene."</p></div>`;
