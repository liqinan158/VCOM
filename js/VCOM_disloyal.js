It would be <i>disloyal</i> to join in with a group of people gossiping about your best friend.</p><p class="long">It's disloyal when a country violates a signed treaty, and it's disloyal for a citizen to spy for a foreign state against its own government. But it's also disloyal to betray the trust of someone in your life. A disloyal sibling tattles on his brothers and sisters, and a disloyal friend won't keep your secrets. This adjective comes from the Old French <i>desloial</i>, "treacherous or deceitful," which adds the prefix <i>des-</i>, "the opposite of," to <i>loial</i>, "faithful."</p></div>`;
