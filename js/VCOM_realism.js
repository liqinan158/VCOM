If you see the world through the lens of <i>realism</i>, you accept what's in front of you and don't pretend it's otherwise.</p><p class="long">For those who follow the doctrine of <i>realism</i>, it's "just the facts, ma'am."  What you see is what you get; if you can't see it or touch it, it doesn't really exist.  Realism is more than just a way of approaching life; it is a formal philosophy and a 19th-century art movement, where animals and people and landscapes are depicted as they appear â€” no purple and green faces or polka-dotted ponies, just people and trees and landscapes painted in proportions and colors that look like the real thing.</p></div>`;
