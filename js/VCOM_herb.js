Well, they all can be created from <i>herbs</i>. An <i>herb</i> is a plant that has a soft rather than a woody stem, and it tends to have a unique taste or smell.</p><p class="long">There are many kinds of plants, but one that you've likely seen mentioned on a menu or ad for a medical treatment is the herb. Herbs are distinguished from other plants by their stem, which does not become permanent and woody; instead, it stays soft. Many herbs are used in cooking, such as basil and thyme, because they add flavor to foods. Many herbs, like ginseng and chamomile, are used in tea and are believed to be good for your health.</p></div>`;
