If you can picture Bambi's <i>dappled</i> rear, then you are on the right track.</p><p class="long">The origins of <i>dappled</i> are a bit mysterious. Its use as an adjective may date from around 1400, from a Middle English word that referred to the markings on an apple, or maybe to gray horses with round blotches that resembled apples. <i>Dappled</i> is usually used to describe markings on a horse or a deer, though photographers also appreciate "the <i>dappled</i> effect of sunlight filtered through leaves."</p></div></div>`;
