It can also be used as a noun: "Take <i>heed</i> of my instructions," said the wizard, "for the magic potion will work only by the light of the full moon."</p><p class="long">The most common use of <i>heed</i> is with warnings, as in "You'd better heed my advice, or you'll be in serious trouble!" The word derives from Old English <i>hēdan</i> and is related to the Dutch <i>hoeden</i> and German <i>hüten</i> — from Germanic cultures where fairy tales with mysterious warnings and magical consequences abound.</p></div>`;
