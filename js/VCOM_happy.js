Many of the early European words for <i>happy</i> actually referred to good luck, rather than a feeling of joy. On its own, <i>happy</i> means an enjoyable or satisfied state of being. When hyphenated, it can refer to an overwhelming inclination to do something. Someone who is trigger-happy, for example, has an overwhelming urge to shoot things, while a clothes-happy person is obsessed with taking trips to the mall.</p></div></div>`;
