If you tend to be introverted and a bit awkward at parties, you might describe yourself as a <i>wallflower</i>.</p><p class="long">A botanist would tell you that wallflowers are actual flowers; a relative of the cabbage, wallflowers are native to southern Europe and grow tiny blossoms of various colors. Figurative wallflowers are even more varied, including introverts, people with social anxiety, and extremely reserved folks. The stereotypical wallflower stands against the wall at a party, too shy to ask someone to dance. This meaning dates back to at least 1820.</p></div></div>`;
