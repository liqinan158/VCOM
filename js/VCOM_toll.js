To drive on some highways, drivers have to pay a <i>toll</i> when they exit.</p><p class="long"><i>Toll</i> comes from the Greek word for "tax," <i>telos</i>. When a fee is charged for the privilege of driving on a road or crossing a bridge, it's called a toll. Another kind of toll is the charge to make a long distance telephone call. Occasionally, <i>toll</i> refers to a different kind of cost â€” a loss of human life: the human toll of an earthquake or war. Finally, there's the toll, or deep ringing sound, of a bell.</p></div>`;
