It's much more common for elderly people to develop <i>glaucoma</i> than younger people.</p><p class="long">Glaucoma is usually caused by fluid building up in the eye and increasing the pressure on the optic nerve. Although glaucoma causes a lot of the blindness in people older than 60, it's almost always treatable if it's diagnosed early enough. The word <i>glaucoma</i> comes from the Greek <i>glaukoma</i>, "opacity of the lens," from the root <i>glaukommatos</i>, "gray-eyed."</p></div></div>`;
