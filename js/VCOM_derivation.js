The derivation of the word <i>derivation</i> is the Latin <i>derivationem,</i> meaning "a leading off or turning away from." For the origin of more physical things, we tend to use <i>root</i> or <i>source</i>: "Stanley wasn't looking for the <i>derivation</i> of the Nile; he was looking for its source."</p></div></div>`;
