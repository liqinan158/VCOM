Picture someone holding a chain saw and wearing a plaid flannel shirt and steel-toe boots, and you can picture a <i>lumberjack</i>.</p><p class="long">These days, <i>lumberjack</i> sounds pretty old-fashioned â€” the same job is done today, but people who do it are typically called "loggers," and they use power tools like chain saws.
