The word originally meant, and still means, a female dog.</p><p class="long">This word for a female pooch has evolved to a more common meaning: a woman you don't like. In those cases, a <i>bitch</i> is kind of a female jerk, although feminists would argue that the term often gets unfairly thrown at any strong willed, assertive woman. Many males call each other <i>bitch</i>, too, implying that the other guy is a weakling. Another common use is <i>bitching</i> or to <i>bitch and moan</i>, meaning to complain about something.</p></div></div>`;
