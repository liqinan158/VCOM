An interloper, then, is someone who has ventured or traveled where he was not welcome. The noun <i>interloper</i> may also refer to something other than a person: "The new chain superstore built at the edge of town and was an interloper among the various mom-and-pop grocery stores in the area."</p></div></div>`;
