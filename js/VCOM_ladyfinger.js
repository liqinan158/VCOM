These cookies are soft little cakes made with eggs, flour, and sugar. Truth be told, ladyfingers aren't very exciting on their own, being so mildly flavored and lightly sweetened that they're commonly given to toddlers. Ladyfingers are best used in elaborate desserts like trifle and tiramisu, when they're soaked in syrups and topped with cream, fruit, or chocolate.</p></div></div>`;
