New York's Ellis Island was considered a gateway for European <i>immigration</i> to the United States during the early 1900's. Nowadays, people immigrate through airports instead of islands.</p><p class="long">The word <i>migration</i> is in <i>immigration</i>, which is something we think of birds doing when they fly South for the winter. It's not an accident â€” if American birds had little passports, they'd have to go through <i>immigration</i> when they got to Mexico. When humans <i>immigrate</i>, they have to follow the rules of the new country or else they risk getting in trouble. <i>Immigration</i> is the act of going to a new country, while <i>emigration</i> refers to the process of leaving one.</p></div></div>`;
