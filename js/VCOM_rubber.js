Most <i>rubber</i> comes partly from <i>rubber</i> trees.</p><p class="long">To make rubber, manufacturers harvest latex from rubber trees by tapping them â€” the process is similar to collecting sap from maple trees. It's then refined and processed, often with other materials, to make things ranging from conveyer belts in factories to balloons and the gloves doctors wear. When rubber first arrived in Europe in the 1700s, it was made into erasers, and the idea of <i>rubbing</i> out mistakes led to the word <i>rubber</i> being coined.</p></div>`;
