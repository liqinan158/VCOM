If you had to work for 10 hours on a two-page writing assignment, that means it was an extraordinarily hard assignment. Either that or you were extraordinarily slow. We often use the word <i>extraordinary</i> as a superlative. If your friend bakes you a cake better than any you’ve ever tasted, you could tell her it is “<i>extraordinary</i>.”</p></div>`;
