In 2012, NASA's Voyager 1 space probe crossed the <i>heliopause</i>.</p><p class="long">Astronomers have various theories about what happens beyond the heliopause, at such a far distance from the sun that solar wind doesn't affect anything. Inside the heliopause is the heliosphere, and everything outside of the heliopause is considered interstellar space. The word <i>heliopause</i> is rooted in the Greek word for "sun," <i>helios</i>, and the Latin <i>pausa</i>, "a halt, stop, or cessation."</p></div></div>`;
