You might be served watercress sandwiches and fruit salad at a book club <i>luncheon,</i> while plain old lunch might be burgers and fries at the diner.</p><p class="long">The word <i>luncheon</i> makes its first appearance in English in the late 1500s, in phrases like "a luncheon of bread and cheese." Originally it meant "a thick piece, a hunk" â€” like a big chunk of bread slathered with cheese.  The word may have come from the Spanish <i>lonja,</i> "slice." By the early 19th century, <i>luncheon</i> had taken the formal route, and its abbreviated form, <i>lunch,</i> came to mean the more casual version of the midday meal.</p></div>`;
