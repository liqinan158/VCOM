Black piano keys and black chess pieces are often made with <i>ebony</i>.</p><p class="long">Used as a noun or adjective, <i>ebony</i> derives from Greek word <i>ebenos,</i> meaning "ebony" and was first used in the 17th century to describe a very dark black color. Cabinetry made out of ebony was very fashionable during the Victorian era because it was imported and considered exotic, but today, because it is considered a threatened species, its uses are limited to small objects, such as animal carvings or parts of musical instruments.</p></div>`;
