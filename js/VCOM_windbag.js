It's an informal way to describe a big talker.</p><p class="long">The word <i>windbag</i> is a useful but derogatory way to talk about a boring chatterer. A windbag might gossip, or brag, or tell a long story â€” but in any case, nothing he says is interesting or useful information. The original fifteenth century meaning of <i>windbag</i> was "bellows for an organ," which was literally a bag of wind or air. By the early 1800s, it took on the metaphorical meaning of "person who talks too much."</p></div>`;
