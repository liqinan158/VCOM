Most <i>mayonnaise</i> is made from egg yolks, oil, and lemon juice.</p><p class="long">Mayonnaise is common in many foods around the world, from fancy French sauces like r√©moulade to Japanese okonomiyaki. In the Netherlands and Belgium, French fries are served with mayonnaise instead of the standard American condiment, ketchup. In the U.S., mayonnaise was first sold commercially in Philadelphia in 1907, made by a local woman named Amelia Schlorer. If you've got a whisk, eggs and olive oil, and a strong arm, you can even make your own mayonnaise.</p></div>`;
