Bosses who behave as if they have <i>omnipotence</i> believe they have absolute power over the employees, maybe even down to the type of ink pens they are allowed to use.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>omnipotence</i> describes having an enormous amount of power, or even an infinite amount. A giant corporation might appear to have omnipotence because of the control it has over its workers, the power it holds in government, and the monopoly it might have in its industry â€” it seems to be everywhere. <i>Omnipotence</i> basically means the quality of being Godlike.
