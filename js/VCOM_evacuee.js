During World War II, many <i>evacuees</i> were moved from dense cities to the countryside.</p><p class="long">When someone is evacuated, or taken away from an unsafe location, that person becomes an evacuee. If an entire family is rescued from a burning building by firefighters, they are all evacuees. Most evacuees have been saved from immediate physical harm, whether from dangerous chemicals, fire, or war. The Latin root is <i>evacuare</i>, "to clear out."</p></div>`;
