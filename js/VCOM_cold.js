It can refer to temperature, passion, friendliness, and even your personality.</p><p class="long">All cold things are icy in some way. Your tea can be cold, and someone can be cold to you. If a play leaves you cold, you don't like it. If police find a criminal’s trail has gone cold, they're out of clues. If you're searching for something, and someone tells you you’re "very cold," it means you're not very close to the prize. A cold is also the infection that gives you a runny nose and sore throat.</p></div></div>`;
