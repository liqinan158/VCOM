You might avoid the old lady next door who smells funny and always wants to pinch your cheek, or you could avoid a certain dangerous neighborhood in your city by taking a different route when you're walking home. It's easy to get <i>avoid</i> confused with a similar word, <i>evade</i>, which means "to <i>avoid</i> in a particularly tricky or sneaky way."</p></div>`;
