The <i>cerebellum</i> is the part of your brain that handles motor control.</p><p class="long">The word <i>cerebellum</i> entered English in the 16th century from the Latin word of the same name, meaning "little brain." The cerebellum is located at the base of the brain, near the back of your head. It looks like a separate structure stuck onto the rest of your brain — so in a sense, it’s like a “little brain.” In addition to motor control, the cerebellum is responsible for balance and muscle tone.</p></div></div>`;
