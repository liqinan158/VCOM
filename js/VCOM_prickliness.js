When you start pruning that rose bush, don't be surprised by the <i>prickliness</i> of those thorns.</p><p class="long">Use this noun when you're talking about thorny things, like brambles and burrs. You can also use it figuratively when someone is very quick to be offended or irritated: "I don't want to proofread your book report â€” your prickliness means you'll get mad at me no matter what I say!" This has been a common way to use <i>prickliness</i> since the late 1800s.</p></div>`;
