If youâ€™re <i>embarrassed</i>, it's probably a result of a situation or action that makes you look bad or appear foolish, like that time you had the toilet paper stuck on your shoe, or forgot to zip your fly at a big business meeting. Avoid becoming <i>embarrassed</i> over your spelling ability by remembering that the word <i>embarrassed</i> has two "r"s and two "s"s.</p></div>`;
