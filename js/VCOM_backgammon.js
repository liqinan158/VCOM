Each player takes turns rolling the dice and choosing the best of many options for moving one or two pieces. You can also capture your opponent's pieces to slow him down. The <i>gammon</i> in <i>backgammon</i> comes from the Old English <i>gamen</i>, "fun" or "game," though the game itself comes from ancient Persia.</p></div>`;
