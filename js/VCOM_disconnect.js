If you work plowing driveways during the winter, you need to <i>disconnect</i> the plow from your truck in the spring.</p><p class="long">You can disconnect toy train cars, and you can also disconnect your laptop from its charger. In fact, unplugging electrical appliances is another way to disconnect something. <i>Disconnect</i> also means a lack of understanding or connection. So there might be a disconnect between you and your brother, or between what a politician promises to do and what she actually does. <i>Disconnect</i> combines <i>dis-</i>, "the opposite of" with <i>connect</i>, from the Latin <i>conectere</i>, "join together."</p></div>`;
