You might question the <i>authenticity</i> of your eccentric uncle's photo of a UFO.</p><p class="long">The word <i>authenticity</i> is the state of something being <i>authentic</i>, or legitimate and true. Authenticity is important when the value of something is dependent on where it came from or how it was made. If you buy a ring said to be worn by Marie Antoinette, you will likely pay a hefty price for it. Before you spend all of that money, you should consult with a historian or experienced jeweler, who will be able to verify its <i>authenticity</i>.</p></div></div>`;
