After his brother came out with bald spots and uneven patches of buzz-cut hair, he was leery of having the same barber get near his own head.</p><p class="long">Being <i>leery</i> is being distrustful. If you're leery, it will probably show on your face and in your posture. You may squint and wrinkle your brows or take a few steps back. If you're leery that someone won't keep a secret, you won't confide in them, and if you're leery about whether they'll keep a promise to you, you won't count on them. Sometimes people are leery because of some proof, but often, just having a bad feeling or instinct is enough to make a person leery.</p></div></div>`;
