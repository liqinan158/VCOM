Upton Sinclairâ€™s 1906 novel <i>The Jungle</i> exposes the unsafe working conditions of a <i>slaughterhouse</i> in Chicago. Good times. Not.</p><p class="long">In order for people to eat meat, animals have to be slaughtered, or killed, and the place where this happens on a large scale is a slaughterhouse. Sometimes it's also called an <i>abattoir</i>. The word stems from a Scandinavian root and is related to the Old Norse<i>slatr</i>, "a butchering." The word <i>slaughterhouse</i> can also refer to a violent situation. In Kurt Vonnegut's novel "<i>Slaughterhouse</i> Five," war prisoners are housed in an abandoned slaughterhouse, which is also a metaphor for war itself.</p></div>`;
