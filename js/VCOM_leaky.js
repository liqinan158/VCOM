You can also talk about a leaky government, or a leaky newsroom â€” in other words, a group or a person guilty of exposing information that's meant to be kept secret or confidential. This kind of <i>leak</i> is a "deliberate disclosure of information," and it dates from the 1950s.</p></div></div>`;
