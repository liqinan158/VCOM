People who find fault with you at every turn, who appreciate nothing and complain, complain, complain, are <i>carping</i>. Enough already!</p><p class="long">Your annoying aunt Mildred who constantly picks on you, listing all the things she thinks are wrong about the way you dress, the style of your hair, who you’re dating, and where you’re working? She’s carping. <i>Carping</i> can also be used as an adjective, to describe someone who is overly critical and impossible to please — like that carping food critic who ruined the debut of your new restaurant.</p></div></div>`;
