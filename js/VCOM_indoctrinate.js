Cults, political entities, and even fans of particular sports teams are often said to <i>indoctrinate</i> their followers.</p><p class="long">If you <i>indoctrinate</i> someone, the goal is to have that person follow a particular set of beliefs (or a <i>doctrine</i>), rather than being able to think independently or know right from wrong. For example, a child may be indoctrinated into a life of violence by growing up in a war-torn region, or a student may be indoctrinated into a life as a Marxist by an influential political science professor.</p></div></div>`;
