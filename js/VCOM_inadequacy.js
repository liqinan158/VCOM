If you get a bad grade, it may reveal an <i>inadequacy</i> in your approach to studying.</p><p class="long">The syllable <i>qua</i> in <i>inadequacy</i> rhymes with <i>duh</i>, and the accent is on the second syllable: "in-AD-uh-quh-see." You know that <i>in-</i> means "not," and the suffix <i>y</i> means "the quality or state of." But what is that middle part? <i>Adaequare</i> is the Latin word for "to make equal." So, inadequacy is the state of not being equal — or enough — for something.</p></div></div>`;
