The point of <i>apologizing</i> is usually to clear the slate and explain why you did what you did.</p><p class="long">We all make mistakes. Sometimes we even do bad things on purpose. But it can all be okay, so long as we apologize. <i>Apologize</i> comes from the Greek <i>apologizesthai</i>, which might be impossible to pronounce, but which means, “give an account.” When you accidentally run over your neighbor's flowerbed on your bike, you better be ready to apologize.</p></div></div>`;
