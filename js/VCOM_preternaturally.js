If your dog is <i>preternaturally</i> smart, you may feel like she understands every word you say.</p><p class="long">This adverb is commonly used to describe things that happen in a bizarre or extraordinary way, particularly if they're hard to explain. A magician may cause your friend to appear to hover preternaturally above the ground, for example. Sometimes its use signals that you can't quite believe your eyes: "Those redwood trees were preternaturally enormous!" The Latin root is <i>praeter naturam</i>, "beyond nature."</p></div>`;
