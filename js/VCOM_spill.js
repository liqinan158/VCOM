You can also <i>spill</i> solid objects, like when you slip and <i>spill</i> the contents of your backpack all over the sidewalk.</p><p class="long">When you spill your hot chocolate, the spot it makes where it lands is a <i>spill</i>. The act of spilling it is a spill too: "Sorry about the spill, Grandma." You can take a spill yourself, like when you tumble to the ground from your bike. <i>Spill</i> also means "talk," especially in the context of "<i>spill</i> the beans" or "<i>spill</i> your guts," both basically meaning "tell the whole truth."</p></div></div>`;
