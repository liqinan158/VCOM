For example, a fifty-year-old punk rocker has a <i>deviant</i> appearance, compared to his peers.</p><p class="long">That aging punk deviates, or departs from the norm, of people his age. Both <i>deviant</i> and <i>deviate</i> come from the Latin word <i>deviare</i>, meaning "to turn out of the way." Deviants experience this turning away from society, either by choice, or in the case of someone who has harmed another, perhaps by sexual abuse, by being cast out by people who want nothing to do with them.</p></div></div>`;
