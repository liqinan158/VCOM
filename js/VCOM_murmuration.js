A speaker might get distracted if she hears the sound of the audience's <i>murmuration</i>.</p><p class="long">To talk very quietly is to <i>murmur</i>, and one name for the sound this makes is a <i>murmuration</i>. This word is generally used in novels and poems, often describing something that resembles the sound of people murmuring, like the murmuration of rustling leaves in the trees. <i>Murmuration</i> is also a term of venery â€” a collective noun for a group of animals. If you see an enormous, swooping flock of starlings in the sky, you can call it a murmuration.</p></div>`;
