If the sound of your boss moving in his chair sounds like gas, youâ€™re going to have to learn how to <i>suppress</i> your giggles.</p><p class="long">In the strictest sense, <i>suppress</i> means to put an end to something by force, like a government that suppresses the right to free speech by shutting down the newspapers or the military suppressing an uprising by rebel forces. But we also use <i>suppress</i> in less serious terms to describe an attempt to muffle or stifle something, such as suppressing a sneeze in a quiet theater or suppressing your true emotions to not cause a teary scene.</p></div>`;
