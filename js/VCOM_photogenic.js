If you are <i>photogenic</i> there are few, if any, terrible pictures of you out there.</p><p class="long">The word <i>photogenic</i> originally meant "produced or caused by light," and was first used to mean "photographing well" in 1928. Today, it also describes looking good on video or film. Most Hollywood stars are photogenic, but then, they have armies of wardrobe, hair, and makeup pros, not to mention digital "correction" artists who erase every shadow and blemish.</p></div></div>`;
