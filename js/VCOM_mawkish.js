var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">mawkish</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Mawkish</i> means excessively sentimental or so sappy it's sickening. Which is how you'd describe two lovebirds gushing over each other or your grandma’s cooing, cheek pinches, and sloppy-lipstick kisses.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>mawkish</i> came into vogue in the 1600s. Oddly enough, it's rooted in the Middle English word <i>maggot</i> and originally meant “sickly or nauseated.” But <i>mawkish</i> eventually evolved to mean something so overly sentimental it makes you sick. It's not a word you hear very often these days, but feel free to use it to describe really lame love poems and annoyingly mushy Valentine's Day cards.</p></div>`;
