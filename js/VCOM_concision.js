If it's taken you only two minutes to describe all nine seasons of your favorite TV show, you've done it with <i>concision</i>.</p><p class="long">In the 1500s, <i>concision</i> meant "a cutting away" or "a mutilation," from the Latin <i>concidere</i>, "to cut off or cut to pieces." For some wordy writers, an editor's emphasis on concision (cutting out extra words) might feel as violent as that, but really it's simply a matter of becoming more <i>concise</i>, or short and to the point.</p></div>`;
