In other words, you temporarily lose them.</p><p class="long">You can use the verb <i>misplace</i> when you can't find something. If you misplace your favorite coffee cup, you'll be annoyed, but if you misplace your wallet it could cause you real problems. The word implies that the object isn't gone for good, but that you unthinkingly put it down somewhere. When you combine the prefix <i>mis-</i>, which means "bad or wrong," and <i>place</i>, you get <i>misplace</i> â€” as in placing something in a bad spot!</p></div></div>`;
