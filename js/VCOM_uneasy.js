You might feel socially <i>uneasy</i> when dining with your girlfriend's parents if they don't like you very much. Your stomach may also feel <i>uneasy</i> at that same dinner and gurgle in an embarrassing way.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>uneasy</i> has many shades of meaning, most involving mild discomfort. It can refer to a lack of a sense of security. If McDonald's and Burger King team up to develop a new sandwich, that would be an uneasy alliance, because neither side would fully trust the other. <i>Uneasy</i> can also describe causing someone to feel anxious or nervous. If you see someone staring at you mumbling, "That's him, that's the one," you might feel uneasy.</p></div>`;
