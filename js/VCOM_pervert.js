var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">pervert</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>pervert</i> something is to corrupt it. For example, you could "<i>pervert</i> the course of justice" by lying on the witness stand.</p><p class="long">Another common use of <i>pervert</i> is as a word for a person who is sexually deviant; however, people also use this word more loosely to describe anyone who seems creepy. Perverting also means changing or subverting something. A cop who breaks the law is perverting the law. A criminal who convinces other people to become criminals is perverting them. So when you think of <i>pervert</i>, think change â€” change for the worse.</p></div>`;
