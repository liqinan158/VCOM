This word conveys a sense of life: think of a park where there's green everywhere you see. That's verdure. A forest will have even more verdure, and you could find verdure in someone's garden, if it's a big one with a lot of plants. Verdure is so brightly alive that it makes people feel good.</p></div>`;
