If you get lost in the woods, you can use the <i>smoke</i> from your campfire to guide you back to your tent — or you can just use the GPS on your smartphone.</p><p class="long">The saying "where there's smoke there's fire” means that there's always a reason for a rumor. The saying is literally true as well—when you set something on fire, it will begin to smoke. When something "goes up in <i>smoke</i>," it's either destroyed by fire or ruined as though it's been burned: "My dreams of being a magician went up in <i>smoke</i> after that rabbit trick went awry."</p></div></div>`;
