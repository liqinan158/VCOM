They told you again and again and again. And again.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>emphasize</i> works when you really want to stress a point or give extra weight to an issue.  <i>Emphasize</i> comes from words that mean “significance” and “to present or show.”  A player who finally makes the varsity team might emphasize this achievement by always wearing his practice jersey — even off the field, or you might emphasize the importance of being on time by locking the door on latecomers.</p></div></div>`;
