This isn't a single disease, but can refer to any skin condition that's not contagious and involves inflammation or the formation of pustules. Eczema isn't a dangerous condition, but it doesn't look or feel good. If you have eczema, a dermatologist — a doctor who specializes in the skin — can help.</p></div></div>`;
