People feel <i>abashed</i> when they're caught in a lie, or make a mistake, or suddenly feel self-conscious for some reason.</p><p class="long">Feeling abashed isn't quite as painful as feeling ashamed, but it's close. When you're abashed, you're not feeling confident or strong: you're a little shaken up and taken aback. You feel embarrassed or chagrined. This is a word for a self-conscious, uneasy feeling––think caught with your hand in the cookie jar or your drinking out of the milk carton in the middle of the night.</p></div></div>`;
