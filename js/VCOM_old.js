It can be fun to visit your favorite teachers at your old elementary school, or to drive through your old neighborhood. You can use <i>old</i> to describe something of long duration, like your old friends from camp who you visit every summer. <i>Old</i> also has numerous informal or slang uses, like the phrase "any <i>old</i>," which you'd use to say, "I don't want just any <i>old</i> job; I want to be a circus clown."</p></div></div>`;
