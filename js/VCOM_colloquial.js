The roots are the prefix <i>com-</i>, which means "together," and the suffix <i>-loqu</i>, which means "speak." Some may think that colloquial language is not good, when in fact it may just not be appropriate for the context. While it is OK to be colloquial and chatty with friends, it is not acceptable to be colloquial in an essay for school or work.</p></div>`;
