In an old-timey bluegrass song, a character might drink <i>moonshine</i> in the <i>moonshine</i>.</p><p class="long">While <i>moonshine</i> can simply be a synonym for <i>moonlight</i>, it's often used as slang for bootleg (or illicit) whiskey, as well as a colorful way to say "nonsense." For example, you could say, "I listened to her speech, but I finally decided everything she said was nothing but <i>moonshine</i>." This "without substance" meaning is actually the oldest figurative definition of <i>moonshine</i>, dating from the fifteenth century.</p></div></div>`;
