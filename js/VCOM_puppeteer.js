A <i>puppeteer</i> might do this by putting her hand inside the puppet and moving its arms and head.</p><p class="long">Puppets come in many different shapes, sizes, and styles, and they all need at least one puppeteer to operate them. Marionettes are puppets with strings, attached to parts of their bodies, that are worked from overhead by puppeteers. Hand puppets are manipulated from below, and some giant puppets require several puppeteers to move their limbs and heads. The Middle English root word is <i>popet</i>, "doll," from the Latin word <i>pupa</i>, "doll or girl."</p></div>`;
