Be a good friend. Eat chocolate. Get gas money."</p><p class="long"><i>Fundamental</i> has its roots in the Latin word <i>fundamentum</i>, which means "foundation." So if something is fundamental, it is a key point or underlying issue — the foundation, if you will — that the thing is built upon.  Teachers argue that math <i>fundamentals</i> include memorizing the times tables and understanding long division. Many people would also argue that math <i>fundamentals</i> should include knowing how to use a calculator and knowing where the calculator's extra batteries are kept.</p></div></div>`;
