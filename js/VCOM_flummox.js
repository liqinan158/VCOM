Well, fear no more, because <i>flummox</i> means all of these things!</p><p class="long">Things that flummox you are probably not that serious, and often pretty amusing and informal: a TV remote or a crossword puzzle, for example, rather than something major like why your boyfriend or girlfriend broke up with you. (Now that's <i>unfathomable.</i>) Get this: linguists are actually mystified as to where the word <i>flummox</i> comes from â€” they're flummoxed, in other words. It may come from an old English word, <i>flummock,</i> meaning "to make untidy or confuse," but no one is really sure. Now, what could be more suitable?</p></div>`;
