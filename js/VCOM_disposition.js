If your friend woke up on the wrong side of the bed, tell her that she might need a <i>disposition</i> makeover.</p><p class="long"><i>Disposition</i> means the positive or negative way a person views the world. In contrast, your character is determined by your inner moral values, and your personality reflects what you're like as an individual. An animal with an excellent disposition is friendly towards people. If you are cheerful, you're often said to have a sunny disposition. <i>Disposition</i> can also mean "getting rid of something," so cleaning your room might involve the disposition of empty pizza boxes and soda cans.</p></div></div>`;
