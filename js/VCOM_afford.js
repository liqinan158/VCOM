You either have a surplus and therefore can afford something, or else you have a deficit and can’t. It can be in the monetary sense: "$100 for cashmere socks? I can’t <i>afford</i> that!” It can also refer to time: “Since my train wasn't scheduled to leave for another hour, I could <i>afford</i> to wait for my sister ten more minutes.” Or even access: “The castle walls <i>afforded</i> a wonderful view of the moat.”</p></div></div>`;
