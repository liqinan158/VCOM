Like a priest, a shaman is a holy man who represents a religion — in this case, <i>shamanism</i>. Like a doctor, a shaman heals people — or at least claims to do so. If you're not into shamanism, you can use this term more generally: A really good teacher, especially one who works a little mysteriously, might be said to work "like a shaman".</p></div></div>`;
