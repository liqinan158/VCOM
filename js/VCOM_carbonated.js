Ginger ale is a <i>carbonated</i> drink.</p><p class="long">A fancier word for <i>carbonated</i> is <i>effervescent</i>. Anything that's described as a soft drink or a soda is carbonated, tasting fizzy on your tongue. Club soda, seltzer, champagne, and sparkling water are all also carbonated. The process of making a liquid carbonated involves dissolving pressurized carbon dioxide into it. The word comes from <i>carbonic acid</i>, a now obsolete word for carbon dioxide.</p></div>`;
