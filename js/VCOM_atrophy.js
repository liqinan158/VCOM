It also is used to describe things that go dull through lack of use, like skills in sports or artistic creativity. The (unrelated) word "trophy" refers to something that sits on a shelf and is admired, while <i>atrophy</i> is a condition of being "shelved," or made inactive and lifeless.</p></div></div>`;
