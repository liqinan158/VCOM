If you network your computers at home to make it easier to share files, you’re using your <i>technological</i> skills.</p><p class="long">The root of <i>technological</i> comes from the Greek word <i>tekhnologia</i>, meaning “systematic treatment,” and a systematic, scientific approach is still behind modern technological developments. What makes something technological — rather than scientific — is the practical application of the science. The technological advances of the last decades have touched nearly every aspect of life, including how you stay in touch with friends, how you gather and analyze information, how your food is produced, and even how you listen to your music.</p></div>`;
