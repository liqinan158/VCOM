In some ancient societies <i>immolation</i> of animals was a common ritual used to gain favor with the gods.</p><p class="long"><i>Immolation</i> comes from the Latin word <i>immolat-</i>, meaning “sprinkled with sacrificial meal.” <i>Immolation</i> always involves a sacrifice or offering of some sort. The word often invokes burning, a common method of sacrifice. You might read about the immolation of a group who set themselves on fire to protest political oppression. You can also use it figuratively to describe anything that’s sacrificed, like the immolation of your Hollywood dreams for the good of the family farm.</p></div></div>`;
