var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">gaze</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When someone lays eyes on you and keeps looking, it is a <i>gaze</i> or a stare. You can <i>gaze</i> back or just say, "Take a picture; it lasts longer."</p><p class="long"><i>Gaze</i> is both a verb and a noun. When people daydream, they often <i>gaze</i> off into the distance without focusing on anything. Another type of <i>gaze</i>, though, is to look very intently at something, as when you <i>gaze</i> at the sky making pictures out of clouds. A contest to see who will blink first means taking a long <i>gaze</i> into someone's eyes, and this type of <i>gaze</i> (the noun) will leave your eyes in a bit of a haze when you're done.</p></div>`;
