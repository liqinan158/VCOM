The <i>obverse</i> of a quarter is the side with the handsome profile of George Washington on it.</p><p class="long"><i>Obverse</i> is very often used to mean "the front of a coin or medal," although you can also use it to describe the principal or more obvious side of anything with a front and a back. Confusingly, this word also means "the opposite," as in, "Your messy room is the <i>obverse</i> of your idea of yourself as a tidy person." The Latin root helps to explain this seeming conflict between meanings â€” <i>obversus</i> means both "directed toward" and "turned against."</p></div></div>`;
