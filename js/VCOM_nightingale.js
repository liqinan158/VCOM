If you hear the distinctive whistles of the <i>nightingale</i>, it is most likely a male bird seeking a mate.</p><p class="long">Nightingales got their name because of the unattached male's habit of singing long into the night (although nightingales also sing during the day). Its song is distinctive and powerful, with trills, whistles, and gurgling sounds punctuating it. The nightingale has inspired writers of all sorts throughout history, including ancient Greeks, the poet Chaucer, and T.S. Eliot in "The Waste Land." The name <i>nightingale</i> combines <i>night</i> with the Proto-Germanic <i>galon</i>, "to sing."</p></div>`;
