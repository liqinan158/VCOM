You might give the painters every <i>dimension</i> of the rooms you want painted, including depth, height, and width.</p><p class="long">In addition to physical objects, <i>dimension</i> can describe something less tangible, such as the magnitude or extent of something. You might be shocked by the dimension of damage from the explosion down the street. <i>Dimension</i> can also be a feature of something, such as an experience, situation, flavor, or thing. Painting your bedroom purple will add a mystical dimension to your dwelling, especially if you add unicorn accents.</p></div></div>`;
