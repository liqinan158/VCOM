It's an informal way to describe a slight nuttiness or a more serious bout of insanity.</p><p class="long">You might use this phrase for something that drives you batty: "I didn't go <i>around the bend</i> until we got our fifth dog." You could also say, more seriously, "It might drive her <i>around the bend</i> when she hears that her son's in trouble again." The origin isn't clear, as some word experts suspect it has a nautical origin — a <i>bend</i> is a series of sailors' knots — while others think it's related to long, curved driveways leading to mental hospitals.</p></div>`;
