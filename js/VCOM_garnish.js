It is also the verb that means to do the decorating: you can <i>garnish</i> a baked fish with a <i>garnish</i> of lemon slices and parsley.</p><p class="long">Long ago, in 14th-century France, the word <i>garnir</i> meant, in part, "to warn or defend," a meaning that survived in one of the meanings of <i>garnish</i>, "to seize wages to pay a debt." But word meanings often branch out, and "to warn" came to mean "to arm oneself," and later "to fit out or equip." It came to mean "to embellish" in Middle English, and, from the late 17th century on, the word was used commonly for the embellishment or decoration of food.</p></div>`;
