Bully!</p><p class="long">There's a physical way to push, and then there's a figurative way, when you make an extra effort: "If I <i>push</i> myself, I can finish this marathon." You can push other people too: "My parents <i>push</i> me to get good grades." The act of pushing is also a <i>push</i>: "Will you give me a <i>push</i> on the tire swing?" If you push someone around, you intimidate or control them.</p></div></div>`;
