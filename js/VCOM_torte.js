You might order a chocolate <i>torte</i> for dessert at a fancy restaurant.</p><p class="long">Tortes are made in round pans and commonly use ground nuts in place of flour. The word <i>torte</i> is German, and many cakes described as tortes are also German (or Austrian) in origin, like the Sacher torte and Linzer torte. The roots of <i>torte</i> go back to the Late Latin <i>torta</i>, "flat cake" or "round bread." Avoid confusing <i>torte</i> and <i>tort</i>, which is much less deliciousâ€”it's a legal definition of a wrongful act.</p></div>`;
