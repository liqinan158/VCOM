If you come across some 18th-century portraits of wealthy men, you'll definitely see a few <i>cravats</i>.</p><p class="long">You can think of the cravat as the ancestor of the tie that's often worn with a formal suit today. A cravat is basically a short scarf worn around the neck and tucked into the collar of a shirt. The word <i>cravat</i> comes from the French <i>Cravate</i>, "Croat" or "Croatian." And it was Croatian soldiers who first started the cravat craze in France during the 1630s. Croatia still observes a national Cravat Day every year on October 18th.</p></div></div>`;
