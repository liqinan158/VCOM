Your daily commute in the morning doesn't generally count as <i>travel.</i> Your trip to Timbuktu? That counts.</p><p class="long"><i>Travel</i> can also be used as a noun â€” as in your travels to Timbuktu. Or perhaps you prefer time travel or space travel. Objects that are especially adapted for use when you travel are often modified by the word <i>travel</i>; for example, a "<i>travel</i>-bag," "<i>travel-</i> games," or a "<i>travel</i> iron." And if something is particularly popular in another country or culture from its place of origin, say a cheese, a wine, or a type of music, it's said to "<i>travel</i> well."</p></div>`;
