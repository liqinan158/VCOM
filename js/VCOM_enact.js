But <i>enact</i> also means to perform, like in a play. (Makes you wonder if the lawmakers are actors!)</p><p class="long">Inside the word <i>enact</i> is that little word <i>act</i>, meaning “to do.” That makes sense, because when you enact something, you make it happen. And of course, we know that to act also means to perform, and so <i>enact</i> means “to act out,” like on stage.  Now that the new rules have been enacted, you'll have to stop wearing your gorilla suit to work.  Even after Labor Day.</p></div>`;
