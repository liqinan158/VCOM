You might treat your mother to a pedicure, or give your dog a tasty treat. <i>Treat</i> can also mean "to carry on negotiations," (the meaning that feeds into <i>treaty</i>), or "to take care of." A doctor treats your illness with medication. If you treat a boy as an adult, that means you act as though he is one, even if he's only 16. Treat him carefully!</p></div></div>`;
