My greatest <i>achievement</i> to date is the time I won the annual hay-stacking contest at the county fair. That was twenty darn years ago, but I still look back fondly on that moment and the trophy I got to take home.</p><p class="long">A noun used to describe something finished successfully or the act of accomplishing, <i>achievement</i> comes from the similarly spelled Middle French <i>achievement</i> “a finishing.” For some people, just being able to make it to work every day on time could be considered an <i>achievement</i>, but the word is usually applied to feats of more heroic proportions. Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, “Every great <i>achievement</i> is the victory of a flaming heart.”</p></div>`;
