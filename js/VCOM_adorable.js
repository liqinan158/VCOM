The origins of the word <i>adorable</i> are actually religious; it was first used only to mean "worthy of adoration." The Latin word <i>adorare</i>, "to ask in prayer," is the root of <i>adore</i>, which in the 14th century meant "to worship." It wasn't until the 1880s that <i>adorable</i> began to mean "delightful" rather than "worthy of worshiping."</p></div>`;
