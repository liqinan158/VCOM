It is also the board that artists use to hold and mix paint. Picture Picasso in his blue period: He is holding a <i>palette</i> on which you see a limited <i>palette</i> of blue tones.</p><p class="long">The meaning of the word <i>palette</i> has extended beyond actual colors to include figurative colors. A musician can use a palette of tones and modes. Either way it is a limited selection from all things available. Don't confuse this word with the homophone <i>palate</i> which refers to your sense of taste. Both words come to English through Old French but have different Latin roots.</p></div>`;
