The phrase became popular in the 1840s, and is even used in law to lessen punishment for crimes, but before that <i>extenuating</i> meant "lessening or making small." The Latin word for "thin," <i>tenuis</i>, combined with <i>ex</i>, means "to make thin", or to dilute a person's guilt because of a good excuse.</p></div></div>`;
