So grab a candlestick, crank the music, and <i>lip-sync</i> while you bust moves around the living room like Tom Cruise in "Risky Business."</p><p class="long"><i>Sync</i> here is short for <i>synchronization</i>, from the Greek <i>synkhronizein</i>, "occur at the same time." <i>Synchronization</i> was first used in the movie biz, referring to getting the pictures and sound matched up. Still, actors often lip-sync â€” if it's done well, it looks like it's the actor who's singing. Bollywood films are almost always made this way. The best part of lip-syncing is the dance moves.</p></div>`;
