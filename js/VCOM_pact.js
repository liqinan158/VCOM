Countries can have <i>pacts</i> or you can make a <i>pact</i> with your friends, promising each other that you'll all show up for the spelling bee.</p><p class="long">A pact is a formal agreement. The 1955 Warsaw Pact, for instance, was Eastern Europe's answer to NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization), with communist countries pledging mutual aid in case of foreign aggression. You may also come across the word <i>compact,</i> which is pretty much the same as a pact. The word <i>pact</i> comes from the Latin <i>pactum,</i> meaning "something agreed upon." In Roman times, one kind of pact was the marriage pact you signed when you got married.</p></div></div>`;
