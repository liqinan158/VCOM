Your hungry pet mice <i>squeak</i> for food, and your creaky old wood floors <i>squeak</i> when you walk across them.</p><p class="long">A door with rusty hinges will squeak when you open it, and your own voice may squeak when you're nervous. There are also the squeaks that small animals make, and the <i>squeak</i> that means "any communication," like when you don't hear a squeak from your next door neighbor for so long you wonder if he moved away. Informally, to "<i>squeak</i> by" or "<i>squeak</i> through" means to just barely achieve something, by a narrow margin.</p></div>`;
