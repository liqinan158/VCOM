A sponge is <i>porous</i>, and if the border between countries is open for anyone to cross easily, it too can be called <i>porous</i>.</p><p class="long">You can see the word <i>pore</i> — meaning "a tiny opening" — in <i>porous</i>. When potters make a mug, they use special glazes to seal the porous clay, which otherwise would absorb the liquid you put in the mug. This meaning has expanded so <i>porous</i> can describe any barrier that allows easy passage in and out, like the porous border between two countries that allows residents to move easily between them.</p></div></div>`;
