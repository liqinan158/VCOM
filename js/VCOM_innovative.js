Something innovative renews or alters the way something has been done. You can use <i>innovative</i> to describe the thing or the person that made it. If your English teacher objects to your experimental writing style, tell him, "I'm an innovative writer making innovative sentences!" Antonyms are <i>unoriginal</i> and <i>hackneyed</i>.</p></div></div>`;
