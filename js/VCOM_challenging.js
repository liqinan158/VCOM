It isn't going to be easy but you will get to test your skills as you push yourself, like completing a <i>challenging</i> crossword puzzle or a <i>challenging</i> hike up a mountain.</p><p class="long">Another meaning of <i>challenging</i> is "causing to question values or assumptions," like a challenging movie that makes you re-evaluate your attitude about something. In other words, it challenges what you believe. People sometimes use <i>challenging</i> as a polite — and far more positive — substitute for <i>troublesome</i> or <i>problematic</i>, as in, "This challenging situation will require everyone's patience."</p></div></div>`;
