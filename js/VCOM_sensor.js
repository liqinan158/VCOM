Your kitchen smoke alarm has a <i>sensor</i> that detects the smoky evidence of your badly burned toast.</p><p class="long">Sensors, these tiny gadgets that detect a physical property, note any changes in it, and convey a message about it electronically, are found just about everywhere. They detect the presence of carbon monoxide in your house, tell you what the temperature is, and help drivers back up safely, alerting them of any obstacles. Smartphones themselves contain many sensors â€” detecting vibration, tilt, magnetic fields, and more. <i>Sensor</i> comes from a Latin root meaning "perceive or feel."</p></div></div>`;
