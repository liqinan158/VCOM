You might come up with a code in which numbers <i>correspond</i> to letters of the alphabet. <i>Correspond</i> can also mean to send messages back and forth. You can use your code to <i>correspond</i> with your pen pal.</p><p class="long">The word <i>correspond</i> can mean "communicating back and forth," like using email to correspond with a far-away cousin. It can also mean "be alike," as in having friends whose interests and personalities correspond to your own. Finally, it can be "be equal to," as in getting a score on a standardized test that corresponds with those of students taking the same subjects as you but who live in other states or countries.</p></div></div>`;
