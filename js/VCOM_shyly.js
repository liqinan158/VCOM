var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">shyly</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the adverb <i>shyly</i> when someone acts in a timid or fearful way. The new kid at school may hesitate  before <i>shyly</i> asking if he can sit at a busy cafeteria table.</p><p class="long">If you're reserved and self-conscious, it's natural to behave shyly at social gatherings. You might stand shyly to the side, too timid to join a conversation, or shyly slip out early without telling anyone you're leaving. <i>Shyly</i> and <i>shy</i> have a Germanic root that means "afraid." Even shy people can be brave, though, like when a child shyly invites a new friend to play after school.</p></div></div>`;
