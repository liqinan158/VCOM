If you are describing a calm, orderly gathering, the word <i>group</i> or <i>crowd</i> may be a better choice. You can save <i>horde</i> for the next time you need to describe, for example, your experience at a pre-Christmas sale (“A <i>horde</i> of holiday shoppers rushed toward the last discounted television set”).</p></div>`;
