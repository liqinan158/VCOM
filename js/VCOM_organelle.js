Chloroplasts, which convert sunlight to energy, are important organelles in plants, and mitochondria, which create energy from the breakdown of sugars, are vital organelles in most organisms, including humans. <i>Organelle</i> is a diminutive of <i>organ</i>, from the idea that just as organs support the body, organelles support the individual cell.</p></div>`;
