Preschoolers might sit in a calm circle for a little while, but they're usually happier running around <i>wildly</i>.</p><p class="long">Doing something wildly involves exaggerating it, or doing it in an unpredictable or uncivilized way, like a wild animal. Angry people shout and gesture wildly, and sports fans jump around and cheer wildly when their team wins an important game. The adverb <i>wildly</i> comes from <i>wild</i> and its Proto-Indo-European root that means "wild" or "woodlands."</p></div></div>`;
