When you <i>arrive</i> in Paris, the first thing you should do is go and buy a croissant.</p><p class="long">The word <i>arrive</i> generally means to come to a physical destination, like a place. Make sure you arrive home on time for dinner! But it can also be less literal. You can arrive at a conclusion or a decision after much thought. You can also use <i>arrive</i> to mean "achieve great success," though for whatever reason, this specific usage tends to be in the past tense. If you serve champagne and caviar at a party, your snobby aunt might comment, "My dear, you’ve <i>arrived</i>!” In this case, <i>arrive</i> means to come to a place of great wealth or success.</p></div></div>`;
