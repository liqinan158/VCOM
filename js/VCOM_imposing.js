A person who is imposing might strike a pose because they feel they have a lot to show. In fact, <i>imposing</i> is derived from the French verb <i>imposer</i>, which means "to inflict." Its French roots may inspire you to envision the enormous and expensive wigs worn by members of the French court. The larger the wig, the more imposing it was. And all the more reason to strike a pose!</p></div></div>`;
