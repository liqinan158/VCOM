That means you will have a plan that displays how you will get from point to point in your travels and when you will be at each point. This word comes from the Middle English <i>itinerarius</i> and is defined as being "about a journey." <i>Itineraries</i> can be really useful because if you give your mother yours, she will always know where you are!</p></div>`;
