A cavity is one thing that can give you a bad <i>toothache</i> — so be sure to floss regularly.</p><p class="long">Breaking a tooth on a hard piece of candy, grinding your teeth at night, not going to the dentist for months, or eating too soon after dental surgery — all of these can result in a toothache. There's also the short, sharp pain of biting into something cold, which is less likely to be described as a toothache. For a true toothache, it's usually a good idea to see a dentist.</p></div></div>`;
