It's also <i>paper</i> that you fold carefully into the shape of an airplane before launching it across the classroom.</p><p class="long">If you've ever ripped a sheet of paper or crumpled one into a ball, it might be hard to believe that it comes from trees â€” wood pulp, to be exact. The history of paper is long, dating as far back as the second century BCE in China. <i>Paper</i> can also mean "newspaper," or "essay," and as a verb it means "cover with <i>paper</i>." You might, for example, decide to paper your bedroom walls with colorful pieces of paper.</p></div>`;
