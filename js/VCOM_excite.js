The return of your favorite TV show might <i>excite</i> you, and winning millions of dollars in the lottery will definitely <i>excite</i> you.</p><p class="long">While a new book by a beloved author excites one person, and an extra scoop of ice cream excites another, it might take something like a free trip to Hawaii to excite you. In quantum mechanics, the word <i>excite</i> takes on a more scientific meaning: to raise something, like an atom or an electron, to a higher level of energy. The Latin root of <i>excite</i> is <i>excitare</i>, "rouse, call out, or summon forth."</p></div>`;
