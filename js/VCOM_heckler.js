var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">heckler</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Have you ever screamed horrible things during a sports event, or taunted someone with cruel jokes? You might be a <i>heckler</i>, and you’re probably not very well-liked.</p><p class="long">The word <i>heckler</i> is rooted in an old Dutch verb that means “to irritate, prickle,” and hecklers can be irritating indeed. They sit at baseball games and yell insults at the players, or start booing during a spelling bee. Some comedians love hecklers and often will start heckling them back. Other comedians will jump off stage and attack a heckler — so keep that in mind if you feel like adding <i>heckler</i> to your résumé.</p></div>`;
