All vertebrates have a <i>skull</i>. Pirate flags often feature a human <i>skull</i> and crossbones (because a parrot <i>skull</i> wouldn’t be nearly so scary).</p><p class="long">The wide-eyed head of a skeleton is its skull. Skulls are hard and bony, but they're a little bit flexible as well—characteristics that help them protect the brain they enclose. Your skull consists of two parts: the bones of your face and the neurocranium, or "braincase." The precise origin of <i>skull</i> is uncertain, but it probably traces back to the Old English <i>scealu</i>, "husk or shell."</p></div>`;
