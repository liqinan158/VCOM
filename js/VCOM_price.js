var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">price</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The <i>price</i> of something is how much it costs. It’s usually money, but sometimes not. For example, the <i>price</i> of staying up all night is that you’re really sleepy the next day. Wake up!</p><p class="long">You can use the noun <i>price</i> to mean the money exchanged for an item or service — or use it figuratively, to mean "something negative that's required in exchange for something positive." If you hear the phrase "a small <i>price</i> to pay," think of this figurative meaning. You could say, for example, that having clouds of pet hair all over your house is a small price to pay for your wonderful cat.</p></div>`;
