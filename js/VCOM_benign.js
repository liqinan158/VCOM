When talking about a person, it means "gentle." In reference to weather or climate, it means "mild." In some other contexts, it simply means "not harmful"; you might speak of "a benign tumor" or "an environmentally benign chemical." The word comes from a Latin root <i>benignus</i> meaning "well born," but the implied meaning is "kind" or "pleasant" â€” it's hard to get mad at someone who has a benign disposition.</p></div></div>`;
