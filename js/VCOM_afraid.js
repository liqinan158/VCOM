People are <i>afraid</i> of snakes, bugs, heights, bears, death, and public speaking, among other things.</p><p class="long">Being afraid means you have a fear of something â€” and people are afraid of all sorts of things, from guns to ghosts to being in arguments. People also say, "I'm afraid I have some bad news," which doesn't mean they're afraid of the news, but sorry that they have to share it. It's a similar situation for the saying "I'm afraid so," which is a nice way of saying "I'm sorry, but the answer is yes."</p></div>`;
