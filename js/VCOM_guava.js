Though a guava smells a lot like a lemon, its pale pink flesh and juice are sweet and mild, sometimes described as a cross between a ripe pear and a strawberry. Guavas are native to South America, Central America, and Mexico, and their name comes from an Arawakan word for "guava tree."</p></div></div>`;
