Don't confuse <i>eschatological</i> with <i>scatological</i>, which sounds very similar but has a totally different meaning. To be scatological means to be unhealthily obsessed with excrement, or at the very least overly fond of bathroom humor. Keep your death jokes and poop jokes separate, please.</p></div></div>`;
