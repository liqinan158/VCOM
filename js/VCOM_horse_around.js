Little kids horse around often, for example. The phrase doesn't immediately make sense, because you don't usually see horses playing in this way. <i>Horse around</i> probably comes from <i>horseplay</i>, and it in turn came from the old-fashioned verb <i>horse</i>, which was once used to mean "play crazy jokes on." Experts aren't sure how it came into use, or what horses have to do with it.</p></div></div>`;
