Your distant cousin who parks his camper in your driveway for a few weeks and then moves on? You can call him a <i>drifter</i>.</p><p class="long">The original meaning of <i>drifter</i> was a miner whose job was excavating horizontal tunnels, which were known as <i>drifts</i>. Starting around 1880, it was also used for a type of fishing boat that used drift nets. For most of the 20th century, however, the most common use of <i>drifter</i> was to describe a vagrant, homeless person, or someone whose lifestyle involved drifting from place to place.</p></div></div>`;
