You close your eyes and grimace. You may even jerk your body away from the offensive sight or sound, like the old picture of you in an "awkward stage" that makes you <i>cringe</i> whenever you see it.</p><p class="long">Whether it's a song you hate or someone mentioning an embarrassing moment from the past, you cringe at things that are unpleasant. If you think about the way your body involuntarily flinches or bends in those situations, you won’t be surprised to learn that the word <i>cringe</i> can be traced back to the Old English word <i>cringan</i>, meaning “give way, fall (in battle), become bent.” That’s exactly what your body does when you cringe!</p></div>`;
