At night, the stars look like glittering <i>specks</i> against the sky. And when you look up at the night sky, you might feel like a mere <i>speck</i> in the universe.</p><p class="long">A speck is a bit of color or light, or a very slight amount of something: "I'd like my eggs with lots of salt and just a speck of pepper." If you're extremely tidy, discovering specks of sand on your jeans after a walk on the beach might prompt you to change your clothes. <i>Speck</i> can be traced back to the Old English <i>specca</i>, "small spot or stain," but beyond that its origin remains a mystery.</p></div></div>`;
