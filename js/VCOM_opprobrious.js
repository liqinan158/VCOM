If someone is being opprobrious, she's being abusive and mean. Insults are opprobrious, while constructive criticism is not. No one wants to be treated in an opprobrious way. We can also use this word for bad behavior that causes shame â€” someone cheating on a test is opprobrious. Opprobrious actions are disgraceful, ignominious, and inglorious.</p></div>`;
