If you are on your way to an animal rights event, leave your <i>mink</i> coat in the closet.</p><p class="long">You can use the noun <i>mink</i> to talk about the wild animal itself, which is not only hunted for its fur but also raised on farms, or to describe the wildly expensive coat made from the skin of many minks. A mink is the sort of warm fur coat you'd most likely see on a wealthy city dweller. The origin of <i>mink</i> is Scandinavian, related to the Swedish word <i>menk</i>, literally "a stinking animal in Finland."</p></div></div>`;
