A speed boat's <i>propeller</i> moves it forward by spinning against the water.</p><p class="long">Propellers use the laws of physics to <i>propel</i>, or drive forward, an aircraft or a boat. The basic structure of a propeller is a spinning or rotating shaft with wide, curved blades attached to it. The very simplest propellers were first used in ancient Greece, where the inventor Archimedes invented a "screw <i>propeller</i>" that moved water for irrigating crops.</p></div>`;
