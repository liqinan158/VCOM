Think of how you <i>exude</i> sweat after a workout.</p><p class="long">The word <i>exude</i> is often used to describe sweating — the original Latin root, <i>sudāre</i> means "to sweat." Still, we frequently use the word <i>exude</i> to refer to anything that seems to ooze or pour forth from an object or person. John F. Kennedy was said to exude confidence, while his wife, Jackie, exuded class. But the verb can also have a negative sense, as when we say a skunk exudes a foul smell.</p></div>`;
