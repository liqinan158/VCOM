For water, the <i>freezing point</i> is 32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Celsius.</p><p class="long">The term <i>freezing point</i> describes a moment of transition, much as the <i>melting point</i> captures the moment when ice turns from a solid to a liquid. We're most familiar with the freezing point of water, when icicles form and rain turns to sleet, but every substance has a freezing point. Mercury, for example, has a freezing point of -38.87 degrees Celsius.</p></div>`;
