In a crash, a car's airbag automatically fills with air. Many computers automatically go into rest mode (to save energy) if you don't touch them for a few seconds. <i>Automatically</i> can also refer to how you do something without thinking about it, like if you automatically walk into your old apartment and startle the new tenants.</p></div></div>`;
