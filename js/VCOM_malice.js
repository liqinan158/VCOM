If someone feels <i>malice</i> toward you, look out! They've got bad intentions.</p><p class="long">Just like the Spanish <i>mal</i>, this is a word for badness or evil. Malice isn't just any evil, though: it's evil done intentionally by someone seeking to do harm. People feel malice for people they hate. Malice is even stronger than spite. Out of all the emotions and thoughts you can have, malice is one of the most dangerous. Just about every villain in every movie and TV show is full of malice.</p></div></div>`;
