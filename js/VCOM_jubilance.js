The <i>jubilance</i> of a high school football team that finally wins a game after a season of losses is wonderful to see.</p><p class="long">When you're practically overcome by happiness, you're experiencing jubilance, a celebratory kind of joy. You might enjoy the jubilance of your favorite actor winning an Academy Award, or the jubilance of a little boy jumping excitedly at his birthday party. The word comes from <i>jubilant</i>, which is rooted in the Latin <i>jubilare</i>, literally "to call to someone," but used in Christian writing (including Milton) to mean "to shout for joy."</p></div>`;
