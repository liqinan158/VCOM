In 1976, the United States celebrated its <i>bicentennial</i>, two hundred years after adopting the Declaration of Independence.</p><p class="long">The word <i>bicentennial</i> adds the prefix <i>bi-</i>, or "two," to <i>centennial</i>, which is rooted in the Latin <i>centum</i>, or "one hundred." The U.S. is a relatively young country, so we've only celebrated a few bicentennials, including the two-hundredth birthdays of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. You can use this word as an adjective too: "Next year is the bicentennial anniversary of our ancestors' arrival in North America."</p></div>`;
