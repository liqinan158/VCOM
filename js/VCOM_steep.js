When hiking trails lead straight up mountainsides, they've got a <i>steep</i> incline. <i>Steep</i> also means "to soak in," as in <i>steeping</i> a tea bag in boiling water.</p><p class="long">You often hear <i>steep</i> used as an adjective to describe cliffs, hills, or even water park slides that have a perilous slope. <i>Steep</i> can apply to curves on a chart––you might say when someone who has a lot to learn that their learning curve is going to be steep. <i>Steep</i> also comes up to describe exorbitant changes in costs or spending. Everyone would love to travel more, but sometimes plane fare is too steep.</p></div></div>`;
