If your car crashes into a stationary van, it’s probably your fault because that van was parked. If your aunt is sick and in the hospital and has been that way for a while, the doctor might say her condition is stationary. Animals that don’t migrate are stationary. Troops that aren’t marching are stationary. Something stationary is still.</p></div>`;
