When you hit that last mile in the race and are so tired you want to quit, that's when you <i>rally</i>, finding the strength to pick up the pace.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>rally</i> is often used to describe a physical effort that has been renewed, but it can describe anything that involves bouncing back from a setback. For example, if something makes you feel disappointed, you rally to get your positive attitude back. <i>Rally</i> can also describe bringing people together, often to support a cause. The event itself is also called a rally, like pep rally in which students boost the confidence of their team as it heads into the championship game.</p></div></div>`;
