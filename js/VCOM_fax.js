When you send someone a <i>fax</i>, their <i>fax</i> machine prints it out for them.</p><p class="long">You might need to send a fax when you're signing an important document long distance: for example, a lease or loan agreement might need to be signed, scanned, and sent as a fax. The word is a verb, too: "I'll <i>fax</i> that to you right away." It's short for <i>facsimile</i>, "exact copy," from the Latin root <i>fac simile</i>, "make similar." The growth of the Internet means that faxes aren't used as often as they once were.</p></div>`;
