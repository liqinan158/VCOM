It’s a way of sticking it to The Man.</p><p class="long">We have Henry David Thoreau to thank for the term <i>civil disobedience</i>, which is the title of an essay he wrote in 1849. In it, he encourages people not to follow a law if they feel it’s unjust. Usually, civil disobedience is a peaceful protest like a march or a sit-in. A perfect example of civil disobedience is Rosa Parks refusing to move to the back of the bus — the law was racist, and she refused to follow it.</p></div>`;
