You can plant <i>sedge</i> in your yard, but itâ€™ll look kind of wild.</p><p class="long">The thing that all sedges have in common is a love of moisture, which is why they're often found in wetlands. Many sedges are fine with poor soil and limited sun as well, which is why some landscapers and gardeners are fans. A sedge looks like a type of tall, wide grass with spiky flowers. The fancy Latin name for sedges is <i>Cyperaceae</i>. Claim to fame: the original Egyptian papyrus was made from a type of sedge.</p></div></div>`;
