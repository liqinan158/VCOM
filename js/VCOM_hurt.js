We still have that violent sense in our word <i>hurtle</i> but we use <i>hurt</i> for a whole range of pains. If you stub your toe, it hurts, and if someone is beating you up you might say, "Stop hurting me!" Someone injured in battle or in sports is described as hurt. If you say something you shouldn't on live radio, you'll hurt your chances of winning an election.</p></div>`;
