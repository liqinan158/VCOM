Kennedy’s famous call to action: “Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country." The roots of this word come from the Greek letter <i>chi</i>, which is roughly a cross shape, and chiasmus does involve a crossing over of terms, as in the saying, “When the going gets tough, the tough get going.“</p></div>`;
