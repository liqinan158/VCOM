In fact, you can't say the word without hissing. This type of sound is also known as <i>sibilance</i>, a consonant that's pronounced when a stream of air passes through teeth that are touching or close together. A barista's steaming wand hisses as she foams milk, and some types of snakes hiss in warning.</p></div>`;
