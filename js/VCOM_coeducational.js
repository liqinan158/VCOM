Many women's colleges have begun admitting men over the years, gradually becoming coeducational. The most common way to use the word is to abbreviate it as "coed" or "co-ed." The adjective <i>coeducational</i> has been around since the 1880's, which is around the same time that many United States colleges and universities, previously open only to men, started accepting female students.</p></div>`;
