A <i>vigil</i> can also be solemn, as when a candlelight <i>vigil</i> is held for victims of a tragedy.</p><p class="long"><i>Vigil</i> comes from the Latin word for "awake," and all its meanings include the idea of watchfulness. If you're attending a vigil or keeping vigil, you shouldn't expect to take a nap. The vigil is an apt kind of demonstration for peace movements, as it's calm, non-violent, and solemn, with participants standing quietly â€”  sometimes holding candles.</p></div></div>`;
