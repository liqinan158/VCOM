You could describe your decision to throw a huge party as advantageous for your social life, or the cooking class you took as advantageous to the success of your catering business. If it helps you get what you want, or is generally useful, it's advantageous. The root is the Old French word <i>avantage</i>, which means "advantage, profit, or superiority." Anything that assists in your pursuit of these things is advantageous to you.</p></div></div>`;
