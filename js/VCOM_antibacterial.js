You might put <i>antibacterial</i> ointment on a cut to help keep it clean and free from infection.</p><p class="long">Officially, an antibiotic like penicillin is an antibacterial agent â€” it kills bacteria, microorganisms that cause disease. You're more likely to find the word <i>antibacterial</i> describing special soaps and lotions that don't just wash bacteria off your hands, but actually kill them. The word combines <i>anti-</i>, "against," and <i>bacterial</i>, from the Greek root <i>bakterion</i>, "small staff," which describes the shape of the first bacteria seen through microscopes.</p></div>`;
