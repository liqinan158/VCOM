They all formed <i>partnerships</i> — cooperative relationships where they worked as a team to reach a goal, whether it was robbing banks or inventing Cherry Garcia.</p><p class="long">It’s easy to spot <i>partner</i> hidden inside <i>partnership</i>. That should clue you in to the fact the word is all about the deal sealed between two or more people, groups, or even countries that agree to throw their lot in together to achieve something both want. A partnership can be a legal business relationship sealed by a contract or a casual handshake-driven agreement between friends. A marriage is a partnership. So is a corporate merger.</p></div></div>`;
