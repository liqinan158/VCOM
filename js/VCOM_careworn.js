New parents who have been up all night with a crying baby often appear <i>careworn</i>.</p><p class="long">Nights of interrupted sleep, working a late shift, and traveling a long distance can all make you a bit careworn. Simply fretting or worrying about something is another way for your expression to be careworn. The word emerged in the 19th century, from <i>care</i>, with its Old English root <i>caru</i>, "sorrow or anxiety," and <i>worn</i>, from its sense of <i>worn out</i>, or exhausted.</p></div>`;
