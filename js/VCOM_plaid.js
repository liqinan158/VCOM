It can be a kind of cloth woven with the design, or a name for the design itself. Fashion-wise, it’s a bold but versatile pattern.</p><p class="long">Plaid is traditionally made from wool or flannel with a multi-colored tartan design — in other words, a pattern of vertical and horizontal bands of color. These days, every kind of clothing is available in plaid, from socks to skirts to scarves. In English-speaking countries other than the US, <i>plaid</i> is more likely to be called <i>tartan</i>, in fact. In Scotland, a <i>plaid</i> is actually a traditional blanket-like garment, and in Gaelic, <i>plaide</i> means "blanket."</p></div></div>`;
