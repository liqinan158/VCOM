It also is the "tone" or meaning of a spoken comment.</p><p class="long">The meaning of the Latin word <i>tenere</i>, was "to hold to a course." Then the Old French took the word <i>tenour</i> in the 14th Century, giving it the meaning of “sense,” or a general feeling of a comment. But that same century, the original meaning resurfaced when the word entered the musical lexicon as the Italian <i>tenore</i>, or <i>tenor</i>, the name given to the high male voice because that was the voice that carried, or “held on to” the melody.</p></div></div>`;
