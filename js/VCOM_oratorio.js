It is a performance for voice and orchestra, but the story is told through the music, and not with scenery, costumes, and action.</p><p class="long">In Rome, musical services were presented in the church of the Oratory of St. Philip Neri. An <i>oratory</i>, from the Latin word <i>oratorium</i>, meant "place of prayer." These sorts of musical services spawned the type of music known as <i>oratorios</i>. Handel's <i>Messiah</i> is a well known <i>oratorio</i> that is often performed at Christmas. You are probably familiar with the part that goes "Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"</p></div></div>`;
