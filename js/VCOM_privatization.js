People tend to have strong opinions about privatization, believing either that free enterprise and private companies increase efficiency, or that certain services are harmed by privatization, particularly education, healthcare, and law enforcement. At the heart of <i>privatization</i> is the word <i>private</i>, rooted in the Latin <i>privatus</i>, "belonging to the self rather than the state."</p></div></div>`;
