Someone who is very passive or lethargic could also be called <i>supine</i> — for instance, someone might be <i>supine</i> in the face of continuous threats and insults.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>supine</i> comes from a Latin word, <i>supinus</i>, which means “thrown backwards” or “inactive.”  Whenever a person or animal is lying on its back, belly-up, it is <i>supine</i>.
