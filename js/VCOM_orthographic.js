The spelling of "a lot," "people," "to," and "school" are all incorrect. If you tend to spell this way, it's possible that you have an orthographic processing problem, or trouble visualizing the correct patterns for spelling words, which can also affect how well you can read. English has so many odd spellings that almost everyone makes the occasional orthographic mistake.</p></div>`;
