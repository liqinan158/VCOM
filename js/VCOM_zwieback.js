In North America, <i>zwieback</i> is often given to babies, who can safely gnaw on it with their gums.</p><p class="long">This word comes from the German <i>Zweiback</i>, which literally means "twice-baked," but is commonly used to mean "biscuit." The equivalent Italian word, <i>biscotti</i>, may be familiar if you spend a lot of time in coffee shops, but zwieback is less common in the U.S. These sweet, brittle cookies are made (just as the root implies) by baking the dough twice.</p></div>`;
