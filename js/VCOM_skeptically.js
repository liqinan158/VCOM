It makes sense to respond skeptically to the claim that eating 10 bananas a day will ensure you'll live to be 100 (particularly if it's not backed up by scientific research). Even if you're idealistic and open to new ideas, you'll still react skeptically to certain things, like your brother's assertion that he'll definitely be a movie star one day.</p></div>`;
