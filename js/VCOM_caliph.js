If you become a diplomat in the Middle East, you might have many discussions with <i>caliphs</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Caliph</i> comes from the Arabic word <i>khalafa</i>, meaning "successor" or "next in line." It was taken as a title by Abu-bekr, the first Islamic leader after the death of Mohammed, the prophet who founded the religion of Islam. All great Islamic leaders take the title <i>caliph</i>. Because <i>caliph</i> is an Anglicized version of an Arabic word, from a different alphabet, there are many spelling variations including <i>calif, kalif, kaliph, khalif</i>, and <i>khalifah</i>.</p></div></div>`;
