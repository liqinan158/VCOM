The adjective <i>plangent</i> isn't one you hear very often (it appears most frequently in a literary context), but it's good for capturing a specific sound that evokes an emotional response. <i>Plangent</i> originally meant "beating with a loud sound," from the Latin <i>plangere</i>, "to strike or beat."</p></div></div>`;
