It's worn by priests and other clergymen — so don't go looking to buy a <i>cassock</i> to complete your fall wardrobe.</p><p class="long">Many pieces of clothing have a certain association, like neckties with business or puffy hats with chefs. The cassock is an article of clothing associated with religion, since cassocks are robes worn by members of the clergy in the Christian tradition. Cassocks are usually black, brown, grey, or another plain color, and they go all the way down to the wearer’s ankles. A cassock is part of the priestly tradition for many Christian sects, just like a nun’s habit.</p></div></div>`;
