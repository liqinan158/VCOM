If you let your roommate play the same awful '80s mix over and over and don't say anything, you're probably a very <i>tolerant</i> person.</p><p class="long">Broad-minded and open thinking is a hallmark of tolerant behavior. An individual can be tolerant, and so can a community or a nation if it accepts people from lots of different cultures or backgrounds.  We generally think of tolerance as a good thing, but that doesn't mean being tolerant is easy â€” not with so many family members, classmates, and colleagues around to annoy us.</p></div></div>`;
