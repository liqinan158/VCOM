To sound old fashioned, call it your bedchamber.</p><p class="long">If your home has three bedrooms, you can describe it as a "three-<i>bedroom</i> house." While you might do homework, watch TV, or even entertain friends in your bedroom, it probably has a bed in it, and the main purpose of the room is sleeping. You can also use the term "<i>bedroom</i> community" to mean a suburb — a town that's close enough to a city that people can commute there for work and come back to their own bedrooms at night.</p></div></div>`;
