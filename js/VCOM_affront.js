If someone blows smoke in your face after you've asked him to put out his cigarette, you would consider it an <i>affront</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Affronter</i> was an old French word meaning "to confront" or "slap in the face." It's from the Latin, <i>ad frontem,</i> meaning "to the face." Sure, a slap in the face would still be considered an affront, but other non-physical actions would also count. Some would even call a misplaced apostrophe an affront to the English language. Don't confuse <i>affront</i> with <i>effrontery,</i> which means "presumptuousness."</p></div></div>`;
