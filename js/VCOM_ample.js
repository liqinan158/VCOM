An <i>ample</i> supply of apple muffins at the bake sale is a good thing, as is <i>ample</i> legroom in your new van — but if the vet notices your dog's <i>ample</i> waistline, you might have to put Fido on a diet.</p><p class="long">Like <i>amplify</i> (crank up the volume), <i>ample</i> is from the Latin word <i>amplus</i>, meaning "large or spacious." <i>Ample</i> can be enough or even too much of something. It's great when there's ample parking or ample snacks for a hike, and we'd all be happy if we had ample time and money. But there are things that some people don't want more of — if your principal has ample evidence that you started the food fight in the cafeteria, you're probably going to end up in detention.</p></div>`;
