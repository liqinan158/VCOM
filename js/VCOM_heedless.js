If you head out to surf in a tsunami, you're <i>heedless</i> of the giant-wave warnings.</p><p class="long">When you pay heed to something you pay attention to it or consider it, but if you’re <i>heedless</i> you do the opposite. Sometimes being heedless means being a risk-taker in an exciting way, or it can just mean losing track of time, but often it describes being inconsiderate. If you keep raising the volume when your brother asks you to turn down the music, you’re heedless of his need to study, and if you're heedless of the yellow tape that says "Do not cross," you disregard the law.</p></div></div>`;
