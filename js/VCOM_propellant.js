Your model rocket needs a <i>propellant,</i> or a fuel to push it into the air. You might use something as simple as vinegar and baking soda. Space rockets use solid or liquid <i>propellants,</i> or fuel.</p><p class="long">Propellant derives from the word <i>propel,</i> which means to drive something forward with force. A <i>propellant</i> can be fuel, or the explosive charge that pushes a bullet out of a gun. Gases used to propel can be called "<i>propellant</i> gases" and might be stored in a "<i>propellant</i> tank." Note that some dictionaries accept the variant spelling <i>propellent.</i></p></div></div>`;
