Some actresses have such enchanting faces that audiences will sit through terrible movies just to gaze at them. If your grandmother describes a little boy with enchanting manners, she means he was delightfully polite and lovely to talk to. The Old French <i>enchanter</i>, "bewitch or cast a spell," is at the root of <i>enchanting</i>, from the Latin <i>incantare</i>, "cast a spell on."</p></div>`;
