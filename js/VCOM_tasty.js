You could describe your favorite foods, from doughnuts to baked ziti, as <i>tasty</i>.</p><p class="long">While <i>tasty</i> basically means the same thing as <i>yummy</i> or <i>flavorful</i>, it implies a less serious compliment than the word <i>delicious</i>, for example. Potato chips are tasty, and so are grilled cheese sandwiches and soft serve ice cream cones. They're pleasant and appetizing, but not necessarily the most amazing food you've ever eaten. <i>Tasty</i> once had a secondary meaning of "elegant" or "tasteful."</p></div>`;
