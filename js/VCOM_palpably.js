var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">palpably</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the adverb <i>palpably</i> to describe something you can physically feel or otherwise notice quite clearly. If a talent show singer is <i>palpably</i> anxious, it will be a wonderful surprise when she belts out a perfect aria.</p><p class="long">The literal meaning of <i>palpably</i> is "in a way that can be felt or palpated," from its Latin root <i>palpare</i>, "touch gently." Feeling a knot that's swelling palpably in your arm gives your doctor a clue about whether it's sprained or broken. It's most common to use this word in a figurative way, for things you can't actually touch: "He was palpably relieved when the test was over" or "The mood at her birthday party was palpably joyous."</p></div>`;
