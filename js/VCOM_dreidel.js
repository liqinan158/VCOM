Candy makers invented the newer tradition of chocolate versions covered in gold foil. To play with a dreidel, you spin it, and depending which side lands facing up, you either lose game pieces or take them from the pot in the center. The Yiddish root, <i>dreyen</i>, means "to turn."</p></div></div>`;
