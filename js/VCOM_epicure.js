Occasionally, you might find the word <i>epicure</i> used for a person who loves something else, but an <i>epicure</i> is usually someone who delights in fine food.</p><p class="long">Epicurus was the Greek philosopher whom we credit with thinking the most about cooking and food. So any time you see the word <i>epicure</i>, remember that that person follows the philosopher Epicurus and therefore loves food.  Being an epicure ain't cheap. Most fine restaurants these days will charge you an arm and a leg for a meal good enough to satisfy a real epicure.</p></div>`;
