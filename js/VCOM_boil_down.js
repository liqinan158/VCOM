A summary of a book should <i>boil down</i> the story to the main idea. In cooking, it literally means to reduce liquid by boiling off the water.</p><p class="long">As you boil down a sauce, stew, pudding, or other dish, you decrease the water or other liquid in it â€” it evaporates in the steam rising from your pan. Another way to say this is that you <i>reduce</i> the sauce. Cooks do this to make something thicker and more flavorful. You can also use the phrase to mean become, or be, essentially one basic thing: "Our disagreement boils down to this: I just can't stand scary movies and you love them."</p></div>`;
