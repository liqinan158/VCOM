An <i>invasive</i> procedure at the doctor hurts, and an <i>invasive</i> plant, like kudzu, grows all over the garden. And the yard. And the house.</p><p class="long">Invasive species are plants or animals that are not native to an environment and steadily spread, sometimes taking over the native landscape. The same could be said of diseases such as cancer. Invasive surgery usually involves making an incision with a scalpel. We call policies or laws invasive when they endanger personal or civil rights and liberties. No one likes an invasion. Raccoons are an invasive species in Scotland, but no one believed their fake accents anyway.</p></div>`;
