Super heroes fight for <i>justice</i> because they want everything to be fair and not let bad guys win.

A judge is also known as a justice, and the point of the law is to keep everything in a society fair according to society’s rules. <i>Justice</i> (capital “J”) is also the statue of a blindfolded woman holding scales and a sword. If something is brought to justice, the good guys have been rewarded and the bad guys punished — the scales are even.</p></div>`;
