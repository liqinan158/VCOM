You'll be uncomfortable shaking Uncle Marvin's hand if you're worried that warts are <i>infectious</i>.</p><p class="long">Something that's infectious spreads easily, like infectious cold germs that might be left on a door handle — anyone who touches it might get sick. If your mother tells you the cut on your knee looks infectious, you'd better go to the doctor. Some infectious things are good — like infectious laughter that gets the whole class giggling, or your friend's infectious good mood that makes you forget your cares.</p></div>`;
