It can be a literal <i>handful</i>, like a <i>handful</i> of popcorn, or it can mean just a few, like a <i>handful</i> of trucks.</p><p class="long">You might find yourself eating handfuls of raspberries when you're supposed to be picking them to make jam. Another meaning of <i>handful</i> is "just a few," as in "There are only a <i>handful</i> of dogs at the dog park this morning." And a third way to use this word is to mean "incredibly difficult to handle." If your mom says, "You were a <i>handful</i> when you were a toddler," she means you were not easy.</p></div></div>`;
