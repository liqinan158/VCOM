Someone who's drunk from alcohol might be unsteady on their feet, slur their speech, or not be able to think straight. But you also can be drunk on things like power, passion or hope. This kind of drunk involves strong feelings or intoxicating emotions instead of one too many beers.</p></div></div>`;
