var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">machinate</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>machinate</i> is to scheme or plan something. You might, for example, <i>machinate</i> a way to defeat the more popular candidate in an election for school president.</p><p class="long">You can use the verb <i>machinate</i> in two ways: to arrange or plan in a carefully detailed way, or to plot in an equally careful but somewhat sneaky or underhanded way. While a teacher might machinate to best organize and inspire her class, a movie villain also machinates in order to defeat the hero. Both meanings come from the same root, the noun <i>machination</i>, "plotting or intrigue," which is ultimately rooted in the Latin <i>machina</i>, "device or machine."</p></div>`;
