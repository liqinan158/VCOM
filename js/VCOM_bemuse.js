You could <i>bemuse</i> your teacher by writing an essay as a series of haikus, but don’t. Usually a <i>bemused</i> teacher is not a happy one.</p><p class="long"><i>Bemuse</i> is not the same as <i>amuse</i>, which means to entertain someone or make them laugh. If you tell a joke, you don’t want to bemuse your audience because they won’t laugh, they’ll be too busy trying figure out what you just said. New situations and weird dreams bemuse some people, so they feel dazed and bemused.</p></div>`;
