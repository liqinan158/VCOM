If your grandmother asks you to put the <i>china</i> on the table, you'll grab a stack of plates.</p><p class="long">You can use the word <i>china</i>, with a lowercase <i>c</i>, to mean dishes or plates in general, although the word usually specifies a fine, high-quality kind of ceramic. A china tea cup is delicate, and has a matching saucer, and your dad's best china might only come out at Thanksgiving. Because this delicate kind of dish was originally imported from China, it was first called <i>Chinaware</i>, later shortened to <i>china</i>.</p></div></div>`;
