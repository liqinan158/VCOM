Sometimes you have to break the law to effect change. The students knew the <i>illegality</i> of their actions, and that they might be arrested, but they figured it was worth it to change a bad law.</p><p class="long">The root word of <i>illegality</i> is <i>legal</i>, which is from the Latin word <i>legalis</i>, which means related to or pertaining to the law. <i>Il-</i> means not, so <i>illegal</i> means "not legal," and <i>-ity</i> is a suffix used to make an adjective a noun meaning the "state of or condition of." So literally, <i>illegality</i> is the condition of being not legal. Despite the illegality, people often break the law when it comes to speed limits.</p></div>`;
