If you're a <i>deacon</i> in the Catholic church, you can perform marriage ceremonies and baptize babies.</p><p class="long">In some churches, deacons are ordained like ministers and have the religious authority to perform many of the same actions, from preaching to communion. Other faiths elect deacons from among the laypeople (in other words, these deacons aren't members of the clergy). Some religions don't allow women to be deacons, but in others everyone is eligible for this position. The Greek root of <i>deacon</i> is <i>diakonos</i>, "servant of the church."</p></div></div>`;
