The job of a <i>dendrite</i> is to pass along electric signals it receives from other cells.</p><p class="long">Cells that carry electrical signals or impulses are known as <i>neurons</i>, and the specialized branches on neurons that do the work of receiving and sending these signals are <i>dendrites</i>. Some cells have thousands of dendrites, and each carries a small electrical current when it's working. These fibers are often described as "branches," a reference to their structure â€” and in fact, the word <i>dendrite</i> comes from the Greek <i>dendron</i>, "tree."</p></div></div>`;
