If you ride in a car over bumpy roads holding a bowl of Jello on your lap, you can watch it <i>jiggle</i> until you reach your destination.</p><p class="long">You might feel your body jiggle when you ride on a galloping horse, and you can also jiggle something, like when you accidentally jiggle a chess board and send the pieces flying. The action of moving in this way is a <i>jiggle</i>. <i>Jiggle</i> comes from <i>jig</i>, "lively dance," and is probably an alteration of the earlier <i>joggle</i>, "move with jerks or small bobs."</p></div>`;
