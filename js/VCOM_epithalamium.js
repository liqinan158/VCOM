Many <i>epithalamiums</i> are addressed to brides on their wedding days.</p><p class="long">The poetic form called an epithalamium started in ancient Greece as a song that was sung to the bride and groom on their wedding night by a group of children. Greek and Roman poets, including the poet Sappho, developed the epithalamium, in some cases celebrating specific marriages, and the 16th century English poet Edmund Spenser wrote <i>Epithalamium</i> for his own bride. The word means "bridal song," <i>epithalamion </i> in Greek, from <i>epi</i>, "upon," and <i>thalamos</i>, "bridal chamber."</p></div>`;
