The substance inside a battery is an <i>electrolyte</i>.</p><p class="long">In chemistry, an electrolyte is typically dissolved in a solvent, becoming ionized â€” gaining a positive or negative charge. The resulting solution can conduct electricity when voltage is applied to it, making electrolytes especially useful in batteries. The word <i>electrolyte</i> was coined in the 1800s from <i>electro-</i>, "electrical," from the Greek root <i>elektro</i>, and <i>lytos</i>, or "loosed" in Greek.</p></div>`;
