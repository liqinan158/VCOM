Without <i>decolletage</i>, there would be no cleavage.</p><p class="long">This French word comes from a verb meaning “expose the neck,” and that’s exactly what décolletage does: it’s a low neckline on a woman’s dress or shirt. Décolletage is revealing, and whether that’s sexy or sleazy is in the eye of the beholder. The opposite of décolletage would be a high neckline. People who know a lot about décolletage would include clothing designers and fashion observers. You’ll find décolletage aplenty on the red carpet at any Hollywood awards show.</p></div>`;
