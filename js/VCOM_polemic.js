A piece of writing can be a <i>polemic</i>, as long as it gets someone's goat.</p><p class="long"><i>Polemic</i> comes from the Greek <i>polemikos</i> meaning "warlike, belligerent." It's like challenging someone to a duel of ideas. These days a <i>polemic</i> is usually a piece of writing, such as if the Grinch published a powerful <i>polemic</i> against Christmas. It's like a debate, and philosophers from Nietzsche to Voltaire are known for theirs. The British philosopher John Stuart Mill had this to say about it: "The worst offense that can be committed by a <i>polemic</i> is to stigmatize those who hold a contrary opinion as bad and immoral men."</p></div></div>`;
