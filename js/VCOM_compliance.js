A restaurant chef's <i>compliance</i> with a new sugar-free menu might inspire even the pastry chefs to follow the recipes.</p><p class="long">Plywood helps illustrate the "pli" in <i>compliance,</i> because if you've ever stepped on a piece of plywood stretched across something, you've felt how it gives underneath your feet. It has flexibility. <i>Compliance</i> means being flexible or yielding and giving in to a situation or order. "Pliant" is part of the word <i>compliance,</i> and it means yielding. Agreeing or bending to something like a plan, rule, or direction is compliance.</p></div></div>`;
