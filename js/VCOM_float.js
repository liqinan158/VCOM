Hopefully you know how to swim, so you can <i>float</i> suspended on the surface of the water, rather than sinking straight to the bottom.</p><p class="long">We typically think of the verb <i>float</i> as something you do on the surface of an ocean or pool, but it's possible to float in mid-air too. You just need to be attached to a parachute so you don't come crashing down to the ground. You can also "float on air" in a more figurative sense. For example, if the person you're in love with suddenly gives you flowers, you could float around for hours feeling like your feet aren't touching the ground.</p></div>`;
