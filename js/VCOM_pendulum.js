A grandfather clock might use for timekeeping a <i>pendulum</i> that swings back and forth.</p><p class="long"><i>Pendulum</i> comes from the Latin word <i>pendulous,</i> meaning "hanging down." If someone hangs a pocket watch in front of you and swings it back and forth, saying, "You're getting very sleepy," they're mimicking the movement of a pendulum. We also use the word <i>pendulum</i> to describe a situation moving between two poles or across a spectrum, like the balance of power in a multiparty political system.</p></div>`;
