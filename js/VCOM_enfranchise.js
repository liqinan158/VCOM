Many people under the age of 18 would like lawmakers to <i>enfranchise</i> their peer group so they can vote.</p><p class="long"><i>Enfranchise</i> traces back to the Old French word <i>enfranchiss</i>, a combination of <i>en-</i>, meaning "make, put in," and <i>enfranchir</i>, meaning "to set or make free." In the 1680s, <i>enfranchise</i> came to mean "to admit to membership in a state," something that usually came with the right to vote. You may know the word <i>disenfranchised</i>, an adjective that describes people who lack rights or liberties. To enfranchise is to give or restore rights to the disenfranchised.</p></div></div>`;
