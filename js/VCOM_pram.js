Some fussy babies are soothed by a long stroll in a <i>pram</i>.</p><p class="long">The typical pram has four wheels and a handle. The baby or toddler can sit or lie down in the pram while being wheeled along the street. While <i>pram</i> is a British term — it's more likely to be called a <i>stroller</i> in the US — most parents, babysitters, and nannies will know what you mean if you use the word. <i>Pram</i> is short for <i>perambulator</i>, "one who walks or perambulates," which gained the meaning "baby carriage" in the 1850s.</p></div>`;
