Your toaster is an <i>appliance</i>, and so is your dishwasher. Your dog? Not so much.</p><p class="long">Most modern homes are full of appliances that perform various useful tasks â€” or help you perform them. A hairdryer is an appliance that dries your hair, and a television is an appliance that offers hours of mindless entertainment. The earliest meaning of the word was "action of putting into use," from the verb <i>apply</i>, with its Latin root, <i>applicare</i>, which figuratively means "devote oneself to" or "give attention."</p></div></div>`;
