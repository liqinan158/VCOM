The walls inside your house might be made of <i>plaster</i>.</p><p class="long">New houses typically have interior walls made of drywall, rather than plaster, but older homes usually have many plaster surfaces. Plaster starts as a mixture of lime, gypsum, sand, or cement that's mixed with water. This soft substance is applied to surfaces where it hardens â€” either for walls, works of art, or as casts used to hold broken bones steady. In Britain, a <i>plaster</i> is also a sticky bandage, while an American would call this a <i>Band-Aid</i>.</p></div></div>`;
