You might like to eat <i>sardines</i> on toast for lunch. If you do, we suggest an after-lunch mint may be in order.</p><p class="long">Sardines are most often bought canned, lined up in rows in little tins. The word <i>sardine</i> is actually a general term â€” it refers to a type of fish, most often a small herring, while a slightly larger one is sometimes called a pilchard. The phrase "packed like <i>sardines</i>," describing people crowded together in a tight spot like an elevator or a subway car, comes from the way sardines look in cans. The word itself comes from the Mediterranean island <i>Sardinia</i>.</p></div></div>`;
