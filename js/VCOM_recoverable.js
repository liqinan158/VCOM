If you've just insulated the walls of your house and replaced the old, drafty windows with new energy-efficient ones, some of your costs may be <i>recoverable</i> through savings on your heating bills and tax refunds for energy efficiency. If you delete something by mistake on your computer, you'll be very relieved if you find it's <i>recoverable</i>.</p></div>`;
