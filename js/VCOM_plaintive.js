If you have ever heard the <i>plaintive</i> howl of a wolf, then you know what we are getting at here.</p><p class="long">A <i>plaint</i>, as in <i>complaint</i>, is an expression of sorrow or grief. This word has also been bent a little at the ends to become <i>plaintiff</i> or <i>complainant</i> — the sufferer — in a lawsuit. So, whether you are hearing a plaintive tone in a courtroom, at a funeral, or in the wild (as in an animal's plaintive howl), you can be assured that someone or something desires something desperately.</p></div></div>`;
