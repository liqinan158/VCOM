If you enjoy grappling with your brother, pinning each other to the couch, you might want to take up <i>wrestling</i>.</p><p class="long">Wrestling is one of the oldest sports, dating back to the ancient Babylonians and Egyptians. The original Greek Olympics included a brutal, violent form of wrestling. If you watch or participate in high school or college wrestling, you know that these days, it's a highly controlled, athletic sport.
