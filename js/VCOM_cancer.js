The best chance of surviving <i>cancer</i> usually involves finding and treating it early.</p><p class="long">The word <i>cancer</i> actually means "crab," like the zodiac sign. Around 400 B.C., Greek physician Hippocrates is said to have named the disease <i>karkinos</i>, which is Greek for "crab," when he noticed that tumors formed a crab-like shape. The word <i>cancer</i> describes not just a disease, but any sort of evilness that can spread. Hatred and bigotry are cancers that can destroy communities.</p></div>`;
