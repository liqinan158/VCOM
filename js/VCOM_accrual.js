That's an <i>accrual</i> — a sum of money, or benefit of some kind, that gets bigger over time.</p><p class="long">Strictly speaking, an <i>accrual</i> doesn't have to be financial. Most religions believe you can obtain a spiritual accrual by doing good deeds on earth, for example. The origin of the word, as well as other similar terms such as <i>accrue</i> (the act of obtaining an accrual) come from the Latin word <i>accrescere</i> — meaning "to become larger."</p></div></div>`;
