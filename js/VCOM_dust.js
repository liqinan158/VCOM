A junk shop might be full of beautiful old furniture and books, all covered with <i>dust</i>.</p><p class="long">There's the dust you clean with a feather duster, and then there's the verb "to <i>dust</i>." You can dust your bookshelves, cleaning the dust from them, but you can also dust the surface of a cake with powdered sugar, covering it lightly. Informally, when something "gathers <i>dust</i>," it goes unused, and when "the <i>dust</i> settles," a situation calms down.</p></div>`;
