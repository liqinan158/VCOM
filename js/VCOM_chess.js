The goal in <i>chess</i> is to put your opponent's king piece in a position from which it can't escape.</p><p class="long">A game of chess begins with sixteen black pieces on one side of the board, opposite sixteen white pieces. Each piece can perform a different movement, and each turn involves a player moving a piece in an attempt to attack and remove her opponent's pieces, and to trap the opposing king. Really good chess players learn a lot of strategy and might even compete professionally. <i>Chess</i> comes from the Old French <i>esches</i>, "chessmen," and also "checks."</p></div>`;
