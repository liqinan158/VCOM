The old-timers in a busy office might reminisce about the days before computers, when everyone used typewriters and Rolodexes, and the old-timers in your neighborhood can tell you how quiet it used to be. You can also use this noun to mean "elderly person," like your grandpa and his buddies: "There are so many <i>old-timers</i> at the gym lately, I can never find a free treadmill."</p></div></div>`;
