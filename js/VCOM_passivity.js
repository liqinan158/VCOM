The baby-sitter's <i>passivity</i> led her charges to walk all over her. They stayed up all night and tied her to the chair, and all she said was, "Please stop misbehaving."</p><p class="long">You'd use the noun <i>passivity</i> to refer to the state of being passive â€” passivity applies to someone who accepts the actions or opinions of others without speaking up. Passivity can help you from getting into a fight but that same passivity can mean you might also get a black eye.</p></div></div>`;
