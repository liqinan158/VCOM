In the Lord's Prayer, which is common in many different Christian churches, the final line ending in "forever and ever, amen," was added on to the original ancient Biblical manuscripts and is considered a doxology. The word comes from the Greek <i>doxologia</i>, "praise or glory," a combination of <i>doxa</i>, "glory," and <i>logos</i>, "a speaking."</p></div>`;
