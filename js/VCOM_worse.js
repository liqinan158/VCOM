To compound is to add to, so if troubles, complication, or anything else that entangles are added to a situation, it will get worse. Remember that <i>worse</i> is used to compare two things, such as "now" and "before," while <i>worst</i> compares three or more things. You might use worse than yesterday, but this doesn't make it the worst cold you ever had.</p></div></div>`;
