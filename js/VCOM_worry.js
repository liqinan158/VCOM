var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">worry</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The verb <i>worry</i> is an anxious word; it means to be concerned or nervous. If you sent your carrier pigeon out in the morning to deliver a message, you might <i>worry</i> if it hadn't returned by the afternoon.</p><p class="long">When you worry, you feel uneasy — the way you might worry that you've got spinach in your teeth when you're at a job interview. When it's an animal doing the worrying, it takes on a different meaning: a dog will worry a bone — or gnaw on it and play with it, for hours. The word <i>worry</i> comes from the Old English <i>wyrgan</i>, which originally meant "strangle," and changed over the years to mean first "harass," and then "cause anxiety to."</p></div></div>`;
