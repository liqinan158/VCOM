You jump up and put your shoes on when you're late for school, turn up the volume on the car stereo when your favorite song comes on, get cheered up by your new kitten, and watch the prices at your favorite bakery go up as it becomes more popular. In the 1500s, the verb <i>up</i> also meant "to catch swans."</p></div></div>`;
