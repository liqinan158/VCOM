The fruit of a plant, like an orange or banana, is the product of the plant that we enjoy. (You wouldn't munch on the orange tree's branch, would you?) But <i>fruit</i> is also the product of any work. A woven rug is the fruit of the loom, while an infant, figuratively, is called the fruit of the womb.</p></div></div>`;
