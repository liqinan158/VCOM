The word comes from a liquid soap made in Massachusetts starting in the 1930s that was also called <i>Gunk</i>. If you buy Gunk today, it's a cleaning product used for car engines (and sold by a company known as GUNK). In general though, <i>gunk</i> is a great word for anything messy, slimy, or grimy.</p></div>`;
