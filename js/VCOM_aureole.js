It comes from the Latin word <i>aureus</i>, which means golden, and <i>aureoles</i> are often created in golden hues.</p><p class="long">The meaning of the noun <i>aureole</i> has extended to mean anything that resembles the sort of artistic circle of light that surrounds something. The term is frequently used when describing hair. If you have light-colored hair, in the sunlight, it may look like your head is surrounded by a shimmering aureole. The luminous circle around the sun visible during a solar eclipse is also called an aureole.</p></div>`;
