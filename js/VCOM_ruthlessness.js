Your cruelty toward your younger sister might be described as <i>ruthlessness</i>.</p><p class="long">Someone who's ruthless is uncaring, harsh, or even brutal towards others — and the characteristic of acting this way is <i>ruthlessness</i>. A football player's ruthlessness might be seen as a good thing in the context of a football game, while a dictator's ruthlessness is more likely to be seen as evil and vicious. In the fourteenth century, the word <i>reuthe</i> meant "pity or compassion," from the Old Norse root <i>hryggð</i>. To have ruthlessness, therefore, is to be without pity.</p></div>`;
