Is that a <i>phantom</i>, some weary soul come back from the dead to haunt you?  Maybe it’s a shadow, or maybe it’s a ghost.  Either way, turn on a light and it’ll disappear.  Hopefully.</p><p class="long">Sleeping is difficult if there’s a phantom in your room, because who can rest with ghosts around?  Some phantoms are real, but phantom can also be used to mean "a trick of the mind," like hearing a person outside your window, but then realizing it’s only the phantom rustling of leaves in a tree.  <i>Phantom</i> limb is when someone loses an arm or leg, but their brain can still feel where their limb used to be.</p></div>`;
