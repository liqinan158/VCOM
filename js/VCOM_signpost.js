Smaller roads that meet at an intersection or crossroads often have a signpost marked with arrows and town names, making it clear which direction you should go. Sometimes <i>signpost</i> is used figuratively, to mean an indicator or hint: "The mayor's vote to fund a new school acted as a <i>signpost</i> to her feelings about education in general."</p></div></div>`;
