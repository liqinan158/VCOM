A <i>delivery</i> can be in the form of something physical, as when you receive a <i>delivery</i> in the mail, or verbal, as in the <i>delivery</i> of a speech or address.</p><p class="long"><i>Delivery</i> once could only mean "the action of handing something to another," but it has a long history of being applied in other ways. The idea of childbirth as being a delivery came about in the 1570's, while the term was applied to a punch in the 1580's, and to throwing a ball in 1702. A verbal delivery is the manner in which a speech is presented.  As a comedian, you know the importance of a good delivery â€” timing the punchline just right.</p></div></div>`;
