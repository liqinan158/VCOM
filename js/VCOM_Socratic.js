Plato's famous <i>Socratic </i>paradox is this: "I know that I know nothing."</p><p class="long">Mentions of Socrates come up often in most basic Western philosophy classes. The "method" Socrates famously used for debate and discussion involved a series of questions and answers resulting in critical thinkingâ€”that's the <i>Socratic method</i>. A <i>Socratic dialogue</i> is a similar exchange between characters in literature. And the <i>Socratic problem</i> is that it's difficult to get a full picture of who Socrates was because of contradictions and a lack of sources.</p></div>`;
