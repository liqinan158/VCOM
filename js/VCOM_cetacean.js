They have tails rather than hind limbs, and they have flippers instead of forearms.</p><p class="long">The word <i>cetacean</i> comes from the Latin word <i>cetus</i>, which was used to refer to any large sea creature, and the Greek word <i>ketos</i>, which was a sea monster or whale. The suffix <i>acea</i> means "of the nature of," so <i>cetacean</i> describes a creature belonging to the family of whales or dolphins. As an adjective, the word is used to describe things related to this group. If you like whales and dolphins, you may enjoy cetacean stories like "Moby Dick."</p></div></div>`;
