It's also any act of approving, like when your roommate wants to move out and you give her your <i>blessings</i>.</p><p class="long">Blessings have to do with approval. The first meaning is asking God for protection or favor. Priests and ministers say blessings in church, and some families say a blessing before dinner. Outside a religious context, blessings are less formal. "I give you my <i>blessing</i>" simply means "It's OK with me." People give their blessings to ideas and actions when they agree with them. Giving a blessing is often the same as giving permission.</p></div>`;
