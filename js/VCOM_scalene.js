In addition to <i>scalene</i> triangles, there are isosceles, which have two equal sides, and equilateral triangles, which have three equal sides.</p><p class="long">When it comes to the word <i>scalene</i>, it's pretty important who's using it, and in what context. If your math teacher mentions scalene triangles, you know she's talking about shapes with three unequal sides and three unequal angles. But if a doctor or massage therapist uses the word, she is probably referring to the scalene muscles of the neck, three pairs that differ in length. The Greek root is <i>skalenos</i>, "uneven or unequal."</p></div></div>`;
