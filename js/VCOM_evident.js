If a room is in total disarray, with everything pulled out of the drawers, it's evident that someone has been searching for something. If you leave the room in the middle of a tense meeting, your frustration will be evident. <i>Evident</i> can also simply mean visible. If you look closely at a key hole of your car door, small scratches will be evident in the paint.</p></div>`;
