A newspaper article should be objective, but a poem can bring up all kinds of emotions, depending on the <i>tone</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>tone</i> often refers to sound, as in music, or the feeling conveyed by the way someone speaks: "His <i>tone</i> of voice told me I was in trouble." It can also be used to describe the atmosphere of a place — its flavor or spirit — or the shades of meaning in a work that might reveal the larger intentions of an author. If your body has tone, its muscular structure is strong and appears well defined.</p></div></div>`;
