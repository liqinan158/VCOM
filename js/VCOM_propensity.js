We all have <i>propensities</i> â€” things we tend to do. Dogs have a <i>propensity</i> to bark, and many people have a <i>propensity</i> for getting annoyed by it.</p><p class="long">If you have a propensity for something, then it's something that comes naturally to you or something you just do a lot. Some people have a propensity to laugh. Other people have a propensity for making others laugh, or for being generous, or for getting angry. It's hard to change your propensities. Sometimes a propensity is a bad thing, as in a criminal with a propensity for theft or murder.</p></div>`;
