Well, you could just as easily say pride is a <i>precursor</i> to the fall. A <i>precursor</i> is something that happens before something else.</p><p class="long">You don't have to be a dead languages scholar to guess that this word springs from a Latin source â€” <i>praecursor</i>, "to run before." A precursor is usually related to what it precedes. It's a catalyst or a harbinger, leading to what follows or providing a clue that it's going to happen. Binging on holiday candy is a precursor to tummy aches and promises to exercise more. Draconian policies in unstable nations are often a precursor to rebellion.</p></div>`;
