It’s the act of continuing to live, usually when others fail.</p><p class="long">As the Bee Gees put it in disco’s heyday — <i>survival</i> means “staying alive.” If you look closely, you’ll spot <i>viv</i> in the middle of <i>survival</i>. That’s part of the Latin verb <i>vivere</i>, meaning “to live.” You might recognize it from words like vivid "lively" and vivacious "full of life." Combine it with <i>sur-</i> (over) and you’ll grasp the essence of <i>survival</i>: to keep existing despite hardship or after others die. Charles Darwin’s term survival of the fittest means that only the best equipped live will reproduce and survive.</p></div>`;
