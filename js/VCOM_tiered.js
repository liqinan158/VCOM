Towering wedding cakes are often <i>tiered</i>, with the smallest layer at the very top.</p><p class="long">Stadium or theater seating is tiered â€” each row of seats is placed slightly above the row in front of it, so that people sitting in the back can see over the heads of the audience members in front. Skirts and dresses sometimes have tiered ruffles, each layer a bit higher than the one beneath it. The adjective <i>tiered</i> comes from <i>tier</i>, or "row," from the Old French <i>tire</i>, "rank or sequence."</p></div>`;
