That raised mark on your hand where you burned yourself on a hot pan a few years ago? That's a <i>cicatrix</i>.</p><p class="long">You're much more likely to use the word <i>scar</i>, but <i>cicatrix</i> or <i>cicatrice</i> is common medical terminology, so the nurse who bandages your skinned knee is definitely familiar with this term. In Latin, <i>cicatrix</i> means  "scar," and it's been used in medicine since the 17th century. Botanists use it too, for scars on tree bark: "You can see the cicatrix where they pruned that big branch, near the top."</p></div></div>`;
