So, to insulate is to protect against unwanted changes. Sometimes this can mean keeping out the influence or beliefs of other people, like a parent who tries to insulate his children from people who have different cultures or beliefs. You can see this meaning in the origin of <i>insulate</i>: the Latin word <i>insula</i>, meaning “to make into an island.”</p></div></div>`;
