A boulder falling down a mountain is moving inexorably. If you fail class after class, you're moving inexorably toward flunking out of school. People are always aging, and we're all moving inexorably (though slowly) toward death. This is a strong word for powerful events and forces that just won't stop.</p></div></div>`;
