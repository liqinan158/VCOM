Other people are the opposite: a cheapskate is cheap, meaning they avoid spending money to an extreme degree. Cheapskates don't leave tips when they eat out. Cheapskates don't buy things they need, even when they have the money. Cheapskates would never lend or give money, and they hate spending money on gifts. A cheapskate can also be called a miser or a tightwad.</p></div>`;
