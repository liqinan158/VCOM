The word <i>rouge</i> can also refer to the red color itself, or it can be a verb, which you'd use to say, "Grandma, you're uneven â€” you forgot to <i>rouge</i> your left cheek." The root of <i>rouge</i> is the Latin word <i>rubeus</i>, which itself means "red". A common mistake is to confuse the words <i>rouge</i> and <i>rogue</i>, which means a scoundrel.</p></div></div>`;
