var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">in the lurch</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If you leave you friend <i>in the lurch</i>, you've left her in a bad situation. If she was counting on a ride home after school and you forgot to wait for her, you left her <i>in the lurch</i>.</p><p class="long">When someone is left in the lurch, she's left needing help of some kind, usually abruptly and surprisingly. It's the perfect phrase to use when a person is counting on assistance that doesn't come. This kind of <i>lurch</i> has an entirely different root from the <i>lurch</i> meaning "abrupt roll or tilt." This lurch comes from a sixteenth century game, <i>lourche</i>, and the situation in which one player loses by a wide margin â€” or is <i>left in the lurch</i> by the other.</p></div>`;
