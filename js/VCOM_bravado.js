Picture a cowboy bursting through saloon doors in an old western, and you can picture <i>bravado</i>.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>bravado</i> is derived from the French and Italian words meaning "bragging and boasting," and it is related to the word <i>bravo</i>. Today, the word means an almost-over-the-top amount of courage, but it can also be used (often with the word <i>false</i>) to mean a false show of bravery: "It was her first day in the classroom and she was almost shaking with fear, but with false <i>bravado</i> — she took a deep breath and turned to face her students — 20 kindergartners."</p></div>`;
