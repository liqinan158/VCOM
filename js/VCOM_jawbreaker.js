You can often tell when a little kid is sucking on a <i>jawbreaker</i> from the bulge in her cheek.</p><p class="long">In North America, the word <i>jawbreaker</i> usually refers to a very sweet kind of candy that can't be bitten because it's so hard. Another kind of jawbreaker is a word that's difficult to pronounce. Words like <i>remuneration</i> and <i>mnemonics</i> are considered jawbreakers by many people, including native English speakers. The adjective <i>jawbreakingly</i> came first, around 1824, describing tricky words, and the candy emerged in 1911. Both versions of <i>jawbreaker</i> use the figurative sense of "breaking" one's jaw, either with language or hard candy.</p></div></div>`;
