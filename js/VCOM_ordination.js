It's the ceremony of bestowing a person with a position of religious authority — as when someone becomes a priest, minister, or shaman.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>ordination</i> comes from the Latin word <i>ordinare</i>, meaning “put in order.” Becoming a religious leader usually requires training in a seminary followed by an ordination. On the other hand, the ordination of a monarch is a ceremony in which a King’s or Queen’s divine right to rule the country, which was historically considered a birth right, is asserted and initiated without any seminary courses required.</p></div>`;
