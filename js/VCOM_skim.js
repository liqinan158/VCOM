Some cooks <i>skim</i> the fat off of the top of their chicken noodle soup, others <i>skim</i> the cream off milk to make <i>skim</i> (or <i>skimmed</i>) milk.</p><p class="long">Cream is what you skim off the surface of milk, and if you don't like the whipped version, you might skim it from your hot chocolate. Another way to use the word <i>skim</i> is to mean "read quickly," like when you skim the newspaper, catching just the headlines as you search for the comics section. <i>Skim</i> has an Old French root, <i>escumer</i>, "remove scum," from <i>escume</i>, "scum." The "glance through a book" meaning came later, in the late 1700â€™s.</p></div></div>`;
