You can use <i>peat</i> in gardens and potted plants, to help the soil stay moist.</p><p class="long">Peat is like a naturally occurring compost â€” it forms in bogs from plants that have broken down. In many parts of the world, peat is burned as a fuel, and in others it's a popular mulch in gardens and on farms. If it's left to continue decomposing for many years, peat eventually turns into lignite, a low-grade coal that can also be burned for heat or as an energy source.</p></div></div>`;
