For breakfast, you could <i>fry</i> yourself an egg, and maybe <i>fry</i> some bacon to go with it.</p><p class="long">You can stir fry vegetables and deep fry doughnuts â€” and you have to be careful on a hot summer day not to (figuratively) fry yourself in the sun. When <i>fry</i> is a noun, it's usually short for "French <i>fry</i>," but it also means youngster, or "small <i>fry</i>." This less common meaning comes from Scottish, possibly from the Old Norse root <i>frjo</i>, "offspring."</p></div>`;
