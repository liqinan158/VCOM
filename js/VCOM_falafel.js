Fried balls of <i>falafel</i> are usually served inside a pita or other flatbread. Yum!</p><p class="long">Good falafel is crispy on the outside, soft and savory inside, and served like a sandwich with toppings including tahini sauce, hummus, chopped cucumber, and tomato.  The exact origins of this delicious food is uncertain, but there is an active controversy around who can claim falafel as their ownâ€”Israelis, Lebanese, and Egyptians (and others) all say that falafel comes from their country. In Arabic, <i>falafil</i> means "crunchy."</p></div>`;
