A doctor who practices <i>oncology</i> is called an <i>oncologist</i>.</p><p class="long">You probably think of cancer treatment as a modern practice, but the word <i>oncology</i> has its roots in ancient Greek. The prefix <i>onkos</i> means "mass or bulk” (and eventually evolved into the modern Latin <i>onco</i> — meaning tumor) and the suffix <i>logy</i> means “study of.” In theory, the word means “the study of tumors.” More often, though, you will hear <i>oncology</i> in relation to treatment and practical medicine, as opposed to just study or research.</p></div>`;
