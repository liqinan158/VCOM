If you talk back to your stern teacher, you won't be surprised by the <i>chastisement</i> that follows.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>chastisement</i> usually means a verbal reprimand, like the chastisement a basketball coach might give his team after a terrible loss. It can also describe physical punishment, or a beating â€” when it's used in the Bible, that's almost always what it means. The Latin root of <i>chastise</i> is <i>castigare</i>, which means "to set or keep right," or "to make pure."</p></div></div>`;
