You can also turn by shifting direction or changing position: "She turned away from him when he started telling terrible jokes." When you flip the page of a book, you turn that as well. And to transform or change is another way to turn: "He turned pale when he saw the ghost." <i>Turn</i> can also be used a noun meaning "an act or instance of rotating." And when you play a board game, you roll the dice when it's your turn.</p></div></div>`;
