Then you're a fan of <i>marinara</i>, the common tomato-based pasta topping.</p><p class="long">In Italy, the word <i>marinara</i> is mainly used for specific pasta recipes, like <i>spaghetti alla marinara</i>, literally "mariner's style spaghetti." Experts aren't sure where the name comes from, though some claim it's inspired by fishermen adding seaweed to the sauce to make it saltier. If you want a classic red sauce in Italy, order <i>pomodoro</i> (which means "tomato") instead. In North America, <i>marinara</i> is the most common name for any tomato-based pasta or pizza sauce.</p></div>`;
