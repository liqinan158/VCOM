A true pastorale is a simple opera that takes place in the countryside or on a farm. Other musical pastorales recall earlier forms of music and tend to be very slow, with droning bass notes. Baroque pastorales include parts of Handel's "Messiah" and a piece by Bach called "Pastorale." The word comes from <i>pastoral</i>, originally "pertaining to shepherds," from the Latin <i>pastoralis</i>, "of herdsmen."</p></div></div>`;
