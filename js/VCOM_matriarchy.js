In a <i>matriarchy</i>, women call the shots.</p><p class="long">The word <i>matriarchy</i>, pronounced "MAY-tree-ar-kee," derives from the Latin word <i>mater</i>, meaning “mother,” and <i>archein</i>, or "to rule." A matriarchy is a social system is which women have more power in the community than men. <i>Matriarchy</i> can also be used more broadly to describe a family that is ruled by a powerful woman. The opposite of matriarchy is patriarchy, a system in which men are the ones holding the power.</p></div>`;
