The <i>joyfulness</i> of a bunch of little kids in a bouncy castle is hard to beat.</p><p class="long">Anything that gives you a sense of deep pleasure or excited happiness produces joyfulness, from being surprised by an old friend you haven't seen in years to watching your favorite team finally win a big competition.
