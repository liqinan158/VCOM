If you really want to insult a woman who is a little short on patience, call her a <i>vixen</i>. She won’t like it.</p><p class="long">Somewhere along the line the word <i>vixen</i> came to mean a hot-headed or ill-tempered person. Nowadays <i>vixen</i> is often used as a derisive term for an unpleasant or mean woman. <i>Vixen</i> also gets used frequently in descriptions of female film characters. In this way it doesn’t really mean that the character is bad tempered. As slang, to call someone a vixen means that she's sexy and flirtatious, a label she may or may not like.</p></div>`;
