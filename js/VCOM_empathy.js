Empathy is different from <i>sympathy</i>, which is pity or sorrow for others' misfortunes. They share a common root in <i>-pathy</i>, from the Greek <i>pathos</i>, "feeling." Where they differ is in their prefixes: <i>sym-</i> means "with," while <i>em-</i> means "in." If you can empathize with someone, it's because you have been in their place: you've "walked a mile in their shoes," as the saying goes.</p></div>`;
