var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">sip</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you drink a small amount of something, you <i>sip</i> it. If your cocoa is extremely hot, you should probably <i>sip</i> it until it cools off a little bit.</p><p class="long">You may sit in a corner and sip your punch at a dull party, but when your long hike leaves you parched, it's hard to sip from your water bottle instead of guzzling. As a noun <i>sip</i> means "small drink," like a sip of Coke or a sip of soup. The origin of <i>sip</i> isn't clear, though we know it's related to the Old English <i>supan</i>, "take into the mouth a little at a time."</p></div>`;
