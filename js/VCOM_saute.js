Many recipes begin by instructing you to <i>saute</i> onions and garlic in olive oil.</p><p class="long">You can saute vegetables, meat, fish, or tofu. The quick, hot method of cooking browns the outer layer of food and keeps the inside flavorful. Sometimes <i>saute</i> is used as an adjective — you might buy your friend who loves to cook a fancy saute pan for his birthday. In French, the word <i>sauté</i> means "jumped" or "bounced," which also describes the way food jumps around the pan when you saute it.</p></div>`;
