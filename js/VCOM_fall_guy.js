The <i>fall guy</i> might end up going to jail while the real guilty party goes free.</p><p class="long">You're the fall guy if you look guilty and are punished for a misdeed when you're actually innocent. A fall guy is often foolish or trusting enough to be taken advantage of, and it's a common character in movies and books. <i>Fall guy</i> is thought to have been first used in the US around the turn of the twentieth century, but its origin is disputed. It most likely comes from a criminal slang meaning of <i>fall</i> — "arrest" or "prison term."</p></div>`;
