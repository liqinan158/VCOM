A tiny crack in your otherwise flawless Ming vase might be its only <i>imperfection</i>.</p><p class="long">In addition to a blemish or defect, imperfection can also mean "the general state of not being perfect." For example, you could say, "Yeah, my dog is funny-looking, but her <i>imperfection</i> is part of what I love about her." The Latin <i>imperfectus</i> is at the root of <i>imperfection</i>, meaning "unfinished, incomplete, or immature," a combination of <i>im-</i>, "not," and <i>perfectus</i>, "finished or complete."</p></div>`;
