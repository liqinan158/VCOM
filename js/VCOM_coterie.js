This, then, is a <i>coterie</i>, an exclusive group with common interests.</p><p class="long">The modern spelling and meaning of <i>coterie</i> developed in the 18th century from a French word rooted in the feudal system. When the farmers working the land of a feudal lord established an organization, they were called <i>cotiers</i>, or "tenants of a cote" (think "cottage"), and that idea of a select group led to the word <i>coterie</i>. There's just something so French about the idea of exclusivity, isn't there?</p></div>`;
