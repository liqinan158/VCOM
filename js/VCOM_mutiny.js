It can be a group of people, like in the famous Mutiny on the Bounty in 1789 when the crew of a British Royal Navy ship kicked the captain out so they could stay in Tahiti. (Totally worth it.) A <i>mutiny</i> doesn't have to be at sea or in the military; it can be to "refuse the order of the person in authority," in other words, every teacher's nightmare.</p></div>`;
