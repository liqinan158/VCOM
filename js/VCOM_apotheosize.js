When the most popular teacher in school retires, her former students might start to <i>apotheosize</i> her.</p><p class="long">When you apotheosize, you <i>deify</i> or <i>glorify</i>, your admiration and respect becoming so exaggerated that you might be talking about a deity instead of a human: "Beyonc√© is a goddess!" This verb comes from the Greek <i>apotheosis</i> and its roots, <i>apo</i>, "change," and <i>theos</i>, "god." Now you know the perfect word to describe what happens when you talk about your favorite basketball player!</p></div>`;
