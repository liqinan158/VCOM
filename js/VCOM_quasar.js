Another type of object is the quasar. Quasars are a lot like suns, though much smaller. Quasars have large redshifts, which means the light from the quasar increases in frequency, moving to the red part of the light spectrum. Quasars are powerful and usually produce a lot of radiation. Don't mess with a quasar!</p></div></div>`;
