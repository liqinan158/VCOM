A rock musician may sing about enjoying wine and women, but in his private life he may be <i>abstemious</i>.</p><p class="long">You might get the idea that <i>abstemious</i> is a relative of <i>abstain</i> with a change of consonant, but in fact the two words only share the <i>abs-</i> prefix, meaning "away." The <i>-temious</i> bit in this adjective is from Latin <i>temetum</i>, "intoxicating drink," so it came to refer to someone who keeps alcohol (or other temptations) at arm's length. This word has the vowels <i>a</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>o</i> and <i>u</i> in alphabetical order; the adverb <i>abstemiously</i> adds the <i>y</i>!</p></div>`;
