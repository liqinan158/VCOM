People often use this word as a compliment for something that just couldn’t be better, as in "That red dress matches your red hair to <i>perfection</i>!” Also, if a musician is getting a song down pat, you could say she’s working on the perfection of the song: she’s learning to play it flawlessly.</p></div></div>`;
