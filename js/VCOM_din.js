Humans have been experiencing loud, sustained, annoying sounds for centuries, judging by the etymology of the word <i>din</i>. It traces its roots back to Old English <i>dyne</i> or <i>dynn</i>, which had the same meaning as <i>din</i> does today, only with a different pronunciation. Before that, it popped up in Old Norse as <i>dynr</i> and meant to "come rumbling down" — fitting, from the language that gave us Thor, the God of Thunder.</p></div></div>`;
