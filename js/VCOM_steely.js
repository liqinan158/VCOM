A sword, a shade of gray, and even a look can be <i>steely.</i></p><p class="long">You might describe the steely glint of the polished silverware on the table, or the steely blue of your cat's eyes. If someone questions you with a steely coldness, they are hard and emotionless—as cold as steel. You could also describe this person as "flinty" or "stony," other unbending adjectives. When <i>steely</i> was first used in the 16th century, it also described things literally "made of steel."</p></div>`;
