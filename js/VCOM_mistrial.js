In other words, she decides that some mistake has been made and the trial must begin again from the start, with a new jury.</p><p class="long">There are several reasons that a judge might declare a mistrial, including a hung jury, which is when the jury can't come to a unanimous decision. There might also be misconduct by an attorney, or improperly introduced evidence. A mistrial usually means having to start all over again. The noun <i>mistrial</i> begins with the prefix <i>mis-</i>, which comes from Old English and means "bad or wrong."</p></div></div>`;
