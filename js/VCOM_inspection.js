An <i>inspection</i> is an official examination.</p><p class="long"><i>Inspection</i> can also mean "a close look at." If you discover a bug in your back yard, it might require a careful inspection to figure out what kind of insect it is. An idea might sound good, but on closer inspection, you find that it won't work. Think of <i>inspection</i> as someone looking closely at something to determine a set of facts.</p></div>`;
