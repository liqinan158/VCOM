As a verb, to <i>plane</i> something is to make it flat and smooth.</p><p class="long">Don't confuse <i>plane</i> with <i>plain</i>, an adjective that means "simple" or a noun that means "flat land," like the plains of the American Midwest. This can be tricky because <i>plane</i> describes something that is flat and level, or the tool or action that makes something flat and level. If you remember that <i>plain</i> applies only to landforms, the difference will be plain to see â€” meaning obvious.</p></div></div>`;
