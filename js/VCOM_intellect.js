Einstein was known for having a great <i>intellect</i>. Mickey Mouse's friend Goofy has almost no <i>intellect</i> to speak of.</p><p class="long"><i>Intellect</i> is the mental equivalent of athletic ability or fashion sense, so someone is an intellect if they have great intellectual ability just as an athlete is someone who has great athletic ability.  Intellect is something everyone has in some degree. If someone talks down to you, it's an insult to your intellect. Your teacher might say you have a sharp intellect if you have the intellect to figure out  difficult problems. An intellectual is a person who has a lot of knowledge and prefers to think about things on an abstract or theoretical level rather than a practical one.</p></div></div>`;
