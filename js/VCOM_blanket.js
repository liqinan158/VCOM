Many small children have a favorite <i>blanket</i> that provides not just warmth, but comfort.</p><p class="long">There is the knitted blanket on your bed, and then there's the blanket of snow that covers your yard in January. Any heavy layer can be described this way: "After a windy day, there was suddenly a <i>blanket</i> of leaves outside." You can use it as a verb, too: "The fog descended and began to <i>blanket</i> the whole town." The Old French root is <i>blanchet</i>, "light wool or flannel cloth," from <i>blanc</i>, "white" or "white cloth."</p></div></div>`;
