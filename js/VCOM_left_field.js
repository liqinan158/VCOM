var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">left field</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">In baseball, the <i>left field</i> is the half of the outfield, beyond third base, that's to the left of the catcher as he faces the pitcher. If you say something is "coming from <i>left field</i>" and you are not talking baseball, you are implying that it's shocking or random.</p><p class="long">From the baseball and softball meaning of <i>left field</i> comes the figurative, popular meaning of the term. If someone accuses you of being out in left field, they mean that you're completely unconventional or hold a surprising (or even weird) point of view. This meaning dates from the 1940s, when it originally meant "out of touch with reality."</p></div>`;
