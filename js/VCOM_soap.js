People use <i>soap</i> for cleaning things like clothes, dishes, hands, and bodies. Don’t bother washing your mouth out with <i>soap</i>, though. It doesn’t get rid of bad words.</p><p class="long">If you ask a chemist about soap, she'll call it a <i>surfactant</i>, a substance that reduces the surface tension of a liquid, making it spreadable. Think of what happens when you lather up a bar of soap under running water and wash your hands with the lather. Soap is made out of natural fats or oils mixed with lye. The Old English root, <i>sape</i>, originally referred to the red hair dye Germanic warriors used to appear scarier.</p></div>`;
