An <i>incautious</i> person might paddle off in a kayak without putting a life jacket on.</p><p class="long">Incautious behavior might include betting your whole paycheck on a poker game, bringing six stray dogs home, or lighting a bottle rocket and launching it from your hand. An incautious child is probably used to hearing adults calling, "Be careful!" <i>Incautious</i> combines the "not" prefix <i>in-</i> and <i>cautious</i>, or "careful," from its Latin root <i>cautionem</i>, "caution, care, or foresight."</p></div></div>`;
