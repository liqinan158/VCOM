The <i>blowout</i> of a city's electrical system can be a particularly big problem.</p><p class="long">A blowout most often involves air or gas pressure â€” a blowout when you're driving on the highway is a popped tire. You can also use the word to mean a really easy victory in sports, like your favorite football team's blowout victory over its rival. Yet another meaning of <i>blowout</i> is a fabulous party: "Let's have a <i>blowout</i> to celebrate your twenty-first birthday!" The original, colloquial American meaning of <i>blowout</i> was "outburst," or what might today be called a "blow up."</p></div>`;
