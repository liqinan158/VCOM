When you <i>recuperate</i>, you heal and recover.</p><p class="long"><i>Recuperate</i> comes from the Latin word <i>recuperare</i> “to take back,” so when you recuperate you gain something back that was yours before — health or money. <i>Recuperate</i> is usually something people do after an illness. If you break your knee playing rugby in college, you might go home to recuperate. If you don't want to sound fancy, just say you're recovering. It also means to get money back, so you can also try to recuperate your losses by staying in the poker game.</p></div>`;
