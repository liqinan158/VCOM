If you do it to relax, recharge your batteries, or just to amuse yourself, it's probably <i>recreation</i>.</p><p class="long">You might think by looking at the word that <i>recreation</i> means remaking something, and, in a sense you'd be right. A person involved in <i>recreation</i> is "re-creating" themselves. The whole point of recreation, as the original Latin word <i>recreare</i> implies, is to refresh and renew. After a week behind a desk, you might be feeling worn down and tired. A weekend of recreation will help bring you back to life. So get out there and do the things you love to do!</p></div>`;
