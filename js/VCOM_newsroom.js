A <i>newsroom</i> is a pretty exciting place when a big story "breaks."</p><p class="long">Any organization where journalists work to produce news has a newsroom â€” it might be an entire office, or a dedicated area. Long ago, a newsroom would have been full of the sound of typewriters clacking as reporters worked on stories. Today's newsroom is more likely staffed by writers using computers. You could also use this word to talk about the area of a library where you can read newspapers and other periodical, news-related publications.</p></div></div>`;
