Some people feel <i>cynicism</i> when politicians make big promises.</p><p class="long">To pronounce <i>cynicism,</i> place the accent on the first syllable: "SIH-nuh-cih-zum." You might associate <i>cynicism</i> with <i>sarcasm</i>. Cynicism comes from believing that people are, at heart, selfish and untrustworthy. Sarcasm is the expression of negative feelings like cynicism, by expressing, for dramatic effect, the opposite of what is meant: "I'm quite sure that politician took that bribe by mistake. We all know how easy it is to overlook the sudden appearance of $2 million dollars in your checking account."</p></div></div>`;
