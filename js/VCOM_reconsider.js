Your neighbor might be planning to vote for a candidate you dislike; however, if you do a good enough job arguing in favor of a different candidate, she might reconsider her vote. The Latin root of <i>consider</i> is <i>considerare</i>, "look at closely," or "observe the stars." <i>Reconsider</i> adds the "again" prefix <i>re-</i>.</p></div>`;
