In biology, red blood cells are said to <i>agglutinate</i> when they adhere to each other, forming a mass of cells.</p><p class="long">There's glue at the heart of <i>agglutinate</i> â€” it comes from the Latin <i>agglutinare</i>, "fasten with glue."  Microbiologists use this word to describe the behavior of cells and particles. Linguistics experts also use this verb: when words or sounds agglutinate, they are strung together to form more complex compound words. In English, one example is <i>shamelessness</i>, which agglutinates <i>shame</i>, <i>less</i>, and <i>ness</i>.</p></div>`;
