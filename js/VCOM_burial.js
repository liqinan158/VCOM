It's a ritual of respect and closure. If your pet lizard dies, give him a proper <i>burial</i> by digging a little grave in your backyard.</p><p class="long">If you've ever been to a funeral, you've probably witnessed a burial â€” lowering a corpse into the ground. Though burying a body is physically like burying anything, a burial involves solemn rituals and deep respect. Often, religious services are given as the body goes under, and the family and friends gather at the burial to mourn the dead. A tombstone or other marker is erected after the burial.</p></div>`;
