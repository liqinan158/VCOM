But reserve <i>gorgeous</i> for the kind of looks that take your breath away. Some synonyms include <i>resplendent</i>, <i>dazzling</i>, <i>spectacular</i>, and <i>splendid</i>. We know that the word comes from Old French <i>gorgias</i>, meaning "elegant," but beyond that it's hard to say for sure. It might have something to do with fancy necklaces adorning the throat â€” <i>la gorge</i> in French. If calling someone <i>gorgeous</i> isn't enough, pack some extra punch and say "drop-dead gorgeous" instead.</p></div></div>`;
