When you're walking down a city sidewalk, every once in a while you have to avoid stepping in some <i>glop</i>.</p><p class="long">If you don't like the looks of your oatmeal, you might describe it as <i>glop</i>, and your cat's stinky wet food is definitely glop â€” there's a distinctly distasteful implication to the word. You can also use <i>glop</i> to describe maudlin, overly sentimental poetry or movies: "I couldn't stand to watch that <i>glop</i>, so I turned off the TV." <i>Glop</i> came along in 1943, its sound imitating a ladleful of gummy gunk hitting a plate.</p></div>`;
