You can count on the regular changing patterns of the <i>tide</i>, unless of course a tsunami is headed your way.</p><p class="long">In a figurative sense, <i>tide</i> can mean a rising swell of support or unified feeling about a certain opinion or topic. So you may surf at high tide but also enjoy the rising tide of enthusiasm about surfing. If there is a wave of anything — immigration, inflation, terror — it can be referred to as a tide. No surfboards can navigate those tricky waves.</p></div></div>`;
