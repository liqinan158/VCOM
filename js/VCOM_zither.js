var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">zither</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>zither</i> is a musical instrument, kind of like a guitar without the neck and way more strings. You play a <i>zither</i> by strumming or plucking the strings with your fingers or a pick.</p><p class="long"><i>Zither</i> comes from the same root word as <i>guitar</i> — the Greek word <i>kithara</i> for "lute.” They’re all stringed instruments, but a zither’s strings go across the sound box. An Autoharp is a kind of zither, so if you've played an Autoharp, you've played a zither. Zithers are often used in European folk music, and have about 30-40 strings. Originally, the zither was an Austrian instrument, but it’s been used in England since the mid-1850s.</p></div>`;
