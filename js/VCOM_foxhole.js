From the safety of a <i>foxhole</i>, troops are protected somewhat against enemy fire.</p><p class="long">While trenches and quick fortifications or dugouts have been used throughout military history, the term <i>foxhole</i> didn't emerge until the very end of World War I, around 1918. The first recorded use was in a US army report from that year, describing German soldiers building "a hole in the ground sufficient to give shelter...to one or two soldiers." The Old English origin is <i>fox-hol</i>, "a fox's den."</p></div></div>`;
