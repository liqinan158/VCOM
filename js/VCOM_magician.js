Another magician is the kind who makes real magic, casting spells and summoning spirits. More people believe in the first kind of magician — who is simply pretending to do magic — than the second. The word stems from the Old French <i>magiciien</i>, "magician or sorcerer," which is rooted in the Greek word for "magical," <i>magikos</i>.</p></div></div>`;
