An untied shoelace is a <i>hindrance</i> to walking, and tripping in the lunchroom might be a <i>hindrance</i> to getting a seat at the cool table.</p><p class="long">You might hear the phrase, "more of a <i>hindrance</i> than a help." It means that something intended to be a positive force has the opposite effect, like when your four-year-old sister tries to help you make dinner. <i>Hindrance</i> refers to the act of slowing things down, or the thing that's causing the problem, like your "helpful" little sister. It's the noun form of the verb <i>hinder</i>, which is "to get in the way."</p></div>`;
