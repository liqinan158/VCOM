A multi-millionaire may choose to instantiate their wealth by driving an extremely expensive car and wearing $500 shoes. A photojournalist might attempt to instantiate the dangers of a particular intersection by taking photos of car accidents that occur there. Whenever you clarify or explain a concept with a real-world example of it, you instantiate that idea.</p></div></div>`;
