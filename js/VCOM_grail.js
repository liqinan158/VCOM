The original Holy <i>Grail</i> is a valuable chalice, cup, or plate — often made of gold — that's sought in medieval and Arthurian legends. The influence of Christianity makes the grail "holy," originally because it was said to have been used at the Last Supper. <i>Grail</i> has a Medieval Latin root, <i>gradalis</i>, "flat dish."</p></div></div>`;
