You might describe the <i>magnificence</i> of a cruise ship, for example, with its elaborate ballrooms and large swimming pools.</p><p class="long">When something makes a huge impression on you, especially for its hugeness or fanciness, it has the quality of <i>magnificence</i>. To a little kid, Disney World has magnificence, while an adult might be impressed by the magnificence of a first class European train car. In the fourteenth century, <i>magnificence</i> implied courage and nobility, as the word comes from the Latin root <i>magnificus</i>, which means both "great, noble, and eminent," and also "splendid, rich, or costly."</p></div>`;
