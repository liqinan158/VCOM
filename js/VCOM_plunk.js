Your daily routine, for example, might include rushing home after school so you can <i>plunk</i> yourself on the couch to play video games.</p><p class="long">There are various ways to <i>plunk</i>: A waiter might plunk your hamburger on the table, and you could choose to plunk down a buck as a tip. You can also plunk the string of a guitar or other instrument, by plucking it casually or inexpressively: "I don't really know how to play the ukulele â€” I just like to <i>plunk</i> the strings." This last meaning is the original one, from an imitation of the sound of a <i>plunk</i>.</p></div>`;
