If the kid sitting next to you in class won't stop the <i>mindless</i> tapping of his pencil against his desk, you'll have a hard time focusing on your vocabulary quiz.</p><p class="long">If something's careless or lacks reason, you can describe it as mindless, like the casual, mindless violence on a TV show. A mindless task is one that you can do without even thinking about it, like sweeping the sidewalk or stuffing fliers into envelopes. <i>Mindless</i> comes from the Old English <i>myndleas</i>, "foolish or senseless."</p></div>`;
