If you want your bedroom walls to be bright purple, you need to buy some purple <i>paint</i>.</p><p class="long">Artists use paint to create landscapes, portraits, and other styles of paintings, and house painters use paint to coat and protect the wood siding on houses. When you <i>paint</i>, you make a painting, or cover something with paint: "First I'm going to <i>paint</i> your portrait, and after you <i>paint</i> that wall in your kitchen, we can hang it there." When someone "<i>paints</i> the town red," they don't literally paint anything â€” they just go on a celebratory spree.</p></div></div>`;
