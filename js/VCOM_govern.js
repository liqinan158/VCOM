Each U.S. state has its own governor, whose job it is to <i>govern</i> the affairs of that state.</p><p class="long">While it's true that governors <i>govern</i> — that is, they head the executive branch of their state government — there are lots of other ways to use the verb <i>govern</i>. Almost anything that controls or has a lot of influence over something else can be said to govern. The rules of tennis, for example, govern the way that game is played. In mechanics, a device that controls other devices is called a governor. My dog's basic needs govern the way my household is run: his schedule is our schedule.</p></div>`;
