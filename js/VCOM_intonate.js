var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">intonate</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>intonate</i> is to speak in a deliberate, almost musical way. Most poets <i>intonate</i> when they read their poems aloud.</p><p class="long">You'll intonate when you're speaking carefully to someone who can't hear well, and also when you're giving a speech. Chanting or reciting a story, song, or piece of verse also requires you to intonate â€” modulating the way your voice rises and falls as you speak. <i>Intonate</i> comes from the Medieval Latin <i>intonare</i>, "speak according to tone," from the Greek root <i>tonos</i>, "string," or "pitch."</p></div>`;
