You have a <i>vested</i> interest in your science project — if your invention works, you could be rich and famous.</p><p class="long"><i>Vested</i> can also refer to something assigned to you. When a minister says "by the power vested in me by the State of Ohio, I now pronounce you husband and wife," he's referring to the legal authority he’s been given to marry people. <i>Vested</i> can also be a financial term. If you’re vested in your company's pension plan after working there 5 years, then even if you quit at 5 years, that pension money is yours to take with you.</p></div>`;
