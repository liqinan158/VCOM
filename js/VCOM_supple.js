If you can wrap your legs around your neck, you most likely have a <i>supple</i> body.</p><p class="long"><i>Supple</i> is often used as an adjective describing a body — such as a dancer’s; a fabric — such as soft leather; or a sound — such as an accomplished singer’s voice. This makes for a strange <i>supple</i> family, but all of its members can move with ease and flexibility. More idiomatically, <i>supple</i> can also be used to describe a mind. In this sense, it does not mean “easily brainwashed,” but has a more positive association with the open-mindedness of free-thinkers.</p></div></div>`;
