It’s the best known of Chinese trees, a deciduous conifer that is also a living fossil. These days, ginkgos are mostly cultivated, not wild, and they are often decorative trees planted on the street. The word <i>ginkgo</i> passed through Japanese before getting to English, but the Chinese name means “silver apricot.” The misspelling <i>gingko</i> is common because it resembles the pronunciation.</p></div></div>`;
