Every house has a particular <i>scent</i> that is recognizable to people as belonging to that house.</p><p class="long">Scent comes from the Latin <i>sentire</i> meaning "to feel, perceive, sense." The word was originally used in reference to hunting dogs, who track down animals by their scent. If you "pick up a scent," then you have a clue about something. If you wear a perfume, then you leave your scent in the air as you pass. Use <i>scent</i> instead of <i>smell</i> if you want to talk about a distinctively nice odor, like the scent of fresh-cut grass.</p></div></div>`;
