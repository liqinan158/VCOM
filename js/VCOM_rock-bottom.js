The rock-bottom prices for books can usually be found online or in a used book store or yard sale, rather than at a new book store. And you'll get rock-bottom prices on groceries if you clip coupons and buy store brands. <i>Rock-bottom</i> was coined sometime in the late nineteenth century.</p></div>`;
