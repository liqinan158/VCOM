Some common examples are <i>playwright</i> and <i>wheelwright</i>, or in other words, makers of plays and wheels. The origin of <i>wright</i> is the Old English <i>wryhta</i>, or "someone who works with wood." Originally, a wright was specifically a wood worker, but later it grew to include many different kinds of professions.</p></div>`;
