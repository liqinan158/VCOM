An <i>exotic</i> pet might be a panda, instead of a hamster. An <i>exotic</i> trip might be a journey to the Galapagos Islands, instead of to Orlando's Sea World.</p><p class="long">Animals and people, or sensory things like food and smells, are often called <i>exotic</i> when they are from far-away lands. In the 16th century, <i>exotic</i> came into use â€” from Latin and Greek words for "foreign," which came, in turn, from <i>exo-,</i> meaning "outside." By the 17th century it was also being used to describe things that are striking or unusual. Even when the words <i>strange</i> and <i>alien</i> are sometimes used as synonyms.</p></div>`;
