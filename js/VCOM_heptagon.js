You don't see many of these in nature bigger than molecules, but people have found several uses for this seven-sided figure, most commonly in coins: the British 20p and 50p pieces are both heptagons. The roots are Greek, and this word shares the <i>hept</i> prefix with other seven-related words such as <i>heptad, heptameter,</i> and <i>heptathlete</i>.</p></div></div>`;
