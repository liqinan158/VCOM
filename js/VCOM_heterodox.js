The adjective <i>heterodox</i> was first applied to people who held a different religious opinion from the standard beliefs and teachings.</p><p class="long">Today, although the religious meaning remains, the adjective <i>heterodox</i> can describe someone who adheres to any atypical beliefs, such as scientists who buck the current thinking or politicians who do not toe the party line. The word can be a synonym of <i>heretical</i>, which describes someone with contrary beliefs. If you are a teacher with a <i>heterodox</i> teaching style, you may win over students but alarm your more traditional colleagues.</p></div>`;
