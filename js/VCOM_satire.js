Politicians are easy targets for satire, especially when they're acting self-righteous or hypocritical.</p><p class="long">Even though the ridiculous language of <i>satire</i> isn't intended to be taken seriously, well-made satire can use mockery to get at more serious truths. Sometimes satire can even overtake reality: when the television sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live presented a mock debate between Al Gore and George W. Bush during the 2000 presidential campaign season, the satire was so dead-on that it influenced the way people thought of the candidates.</p></div></div>`;
