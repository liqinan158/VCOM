Most people would agree that thieves, murderers, and other criminals are lacking morals. A lot of people would say politicians could use some morals as well. Every person has a slightly different set of morals, and different cultures have their own morals as well. You probably get your morals from a combination of your parents, your teachers, your culture, and your religion.</p></div></div>`;
