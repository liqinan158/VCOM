You might go to a milliner before your trip to South America, to buy a large-brimmed sun hat. The earliest meaning of the word <i>milliner</i>, from the fifteenth century, was "vendor of fancy wares, especially those made in Milan," though by the eighteenth century it meant "one who sells women's hats."</p></div></div>`;
