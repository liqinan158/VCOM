You might use a quavering <i>tremolo</i> when playing sad tunes on your violin.</p><p class="long">A <i>tremor</i> is an unsteady, involuntary movement, like a shaky hand or a twitch. Similarly, <i>tremolo</i> is an unsteady, continuous repetition in music. Tremolo can involve one tone being quickly repeated or two tones being rapidly alternated. <i>Tremolo</i> often refers to a form of vibrato — when a singer holds and vibrates a tone — that is not controlled very well, and is considered showy and melodramatic. The root word is the Latin <i>tremulus</i>, or "trembling."</p></div>`;
