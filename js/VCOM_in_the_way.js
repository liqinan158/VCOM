A roadblock is in the way of travelers. In football, the offensive line tries to stay in the way of the defense so they can't tackle the quarterback. Being in the way isn't always physical. Fear could get in the way of taking a trip. Lack of money gets in the way of buying things. Any hindrance, impediment, or obstruction is in the way.</p></div></div>`;
