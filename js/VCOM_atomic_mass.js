The unit of measurement is an "<i>atomic mass</i> unit" or amu. <i>Mass</i> is a measurement in science which is essentially the same as weight, without taking changes in gravity into account, and <i>atomic</i> means "of an atom." The two were first combined into <i>atomic mass</i> in the mid-1800s.</p></div></div>`;
