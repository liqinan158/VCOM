In ancient Greece, <i>anamnesis</i> was believed to include memories of past lives.</p><p class="long">The original, philosophical meaning of <i>anamnesis</i> included taking memories from past existences and using them in your current life, through rational thought and true knowledge. The word has come to mean, more generally, "memory." It can also apply to a patient's medical history; a doctor might take notes on your anamnesis during a first visit. <i>Anamnesis</i> is a Greek word that means "a calling to mind," from the roots <i>ana-</i>, "back," and <i>mimneskesthai</i>, "to recall" or "to cause to remember."</p></div></div>`;
