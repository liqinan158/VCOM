If you find an answer to a question, both the answer and how you got there is the <i>solution</i>. If you dissolve a solid into a liquid, you've created a different kind of <i>solution</i>.</p><p class="long">This noun descends from Middle English <i>solucion</i>, from Old French, from Latin <i>solutio,</i> from <i>solvere</i> "to loosen." Think of <i>solution</i> both as a loosening of the chemical bonds that make something solid––when you loosen the structure of salt by mixing it into water, you create a solution. When you loosen the "knot" of a math problem you do the same thing––you loosen, untangle or <i>solve</i> it.</p></div>`;
