Today, a <i>pageboy</i> is either an employee who runs errands, or it's a bowl-shaped haircut with curled-under ends.</p><p class="long">The pageboy haircut gets its name from the idea that medieval pageboys may have worn their hair in a similar style, although historians aren't certain about this fact. It first became popular in the early 20th century when many child actors had pageboy haircuts, and it became fashionable again in the 1970s when stars like singer Toni Tennille and skater Dorothy Hamill sported pageboys.</p></div></div>`;
