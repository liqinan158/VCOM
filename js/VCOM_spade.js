A <i>spade</i> is perfect for planting bulbs and digging up weeds.</p><p class="long">In addition to a small digging tool, a <i>spade</i> is also a suit of playing card â€” the black one that looks a bit like an upside-down heart. There's even a card game called "Spades" in which a spade has a higher value than any other suit. The two meanings have different roots; the card suit <i>spade</i> comes from the Greek <i>spathe</i>, and the little shovel kind of <i>spade</i> has Proto-Germanic roots that mean "flat piece of wood."</p></div></div>`;
