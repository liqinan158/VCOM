That ambiguous smile is just one <i>detail</i> of da Vinci's <i>Mona Lisa.</i></p><p class="long"><i>Detail</i> comes from the French for cutting into pieces, but in English we only use it to refer to the pieces. As a noun, <i>detail</i> means an isolated aspect of something larger. If you're painting a landscape, don't forget details like individual birds and trees. <i>Detail</i> can also mean a team of workers for a special task. If you go on a group camping trip, try for the food detail instead of the trash detail.</p></div></div>`;
