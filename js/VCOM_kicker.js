It’s usually a football player, but even a donkey can be one. A <i>kicker</i> is also a surprise. You might know you have a test, but the <i>kicker</i> is that you have to take it blindfolded.</p><p class="long">Football games involve players running and throwing the ball, but occasionally they have the opportunity to kick the ball down the field or over the goalpost, and this is done by the kicker. In soccer — also called football in much of the world — every player on the team is a kicker. The noun <i>kicker</i> comes from the verb <i>kick</i>; one guess about the word's origins say it comes from the Old Norse <i>kikna</i>, "sink at the knees."</p></div></div>`;
