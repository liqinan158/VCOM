If you're making a Cajun recipe, your <i>roux</i> might be a mixture of flour and bacon fat.</p><p class="long">Cheese sauces, gravies, and staples of French cuisine like BÃ©chamel sauce all begin as a roux. For most roux, you start by heating butter, oil, or another fat in a pan, then add flour and cook it while stirring or whisking until it's completely incorporated and there's no lingering taste of raw flour. Other ingredients, like milk, cream, cheese, or water, are added slowly to the roux. In French, <i>roux</i> means both "browned butter" and "reddish-brown."</p></div>`;
