A <i>midterm</i> exam is given near the halfway point of the academic term.</p><p class="long">A school year is typically divided into semesters, trimesters, or quarters, and each of these can be called a <i>term</i>. Likewise, a president, governor, or representative serves a specific length of time that is called a <i>term</i>, whether it lasts one year, two years, or six years. The middle of a term, therefore, is a <i>midterm</i>,  from <i>mid-</i>, from a Proto-Indo-European root meaning "middle," and <i>term</i>, from the Old French <i>terme</i>, "duration."</p></div>`;
