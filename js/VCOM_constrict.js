If your new turtleneck sweater <i>constricts</i> your neck, the sweater is probably too small.</p><p class="long">When things constrict, they become narrow or make something else become narrow. A boa constrictor kills its prey when it constricts the animal's body until it can no longer breathe, and a necktie that's tied too tightly constricts your neck. In medicine, certain conditions or medications can constrict openings such as airways or blood vessels, sometimes dangerously. The Latin root is <i>constringere</i>, "to bind together or tie tightly."</p></div></div>`;
