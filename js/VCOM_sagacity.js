And if that is indeed the case, then good for you! We need more sound thinkers.</p><p class="long">The Latin word <i>sagācitās</i> is the great-granddaddy of our word <i>sagacity</i>, giving it the meaning "wisdom."  Just remember that it contains the word <i>sage</i>, which means "wise one" — our wise ancestors were called "Sages." But before we get too puffed up, we need to remember that in the 17th and 18th centuries, <i>sagacity</i> meant "the acute sense of smell in animals." How humbling.  Still, if you display sagacity, you can sniff out a good idea from a bad one.</p></div>`;
