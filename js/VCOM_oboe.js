You play an <i>oboe</i> by blowing into its mouthpiece and pressing keys to form notes.</p><p class="long">The earliest oboe was modeled after an extremely loud, high-pitched Middle Eastern instrument called the <i>shawm</i>. The name <i>oboe</i> was originally <i>hautbois</i>, or "high, loud wood" in French, also sometimes spelled <i>hoboy</i> in English. The Italians transliterated the French name to <i>obo√®</i>, and the English followed around 1770 with <i>oboe</i>.  Another distinctive feature of the oboe is its double reed mouthpiece.</p></div></div>`;
