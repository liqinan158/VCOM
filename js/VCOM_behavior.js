Generally, it’s wise to engage in good <i>behavior</i>, even if you're really bored.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>behavior</i> is a spin-off of the verb <i>behave</i>.  Get rid of the <i>be</i> in <i>behave</i> and you're left with <i>have</i>, which makes sense: you could say that to behave is to "have" or "own" yourself — to control yourself.  There's also a broader definition of <i>behavior</i>, which is basically anything any living thing does in any situation. Brushing your teeth?  Behavior.  Scratching your nose? Behavior.  Eating a large antelope because you are a lion and you're hungry?  Also behavior.</p></div></div>`;
