If you're a <i>pedestrian</i>, you will likely get annoyed at the drivers who don't stop so you can cross the street.</p><p class="long"><i>Pedestrian</i> comes from the Latin <i>pedester</i> meaning "going on foot" but also "plain." As a noun, it's someone walking around â€” sidewalks are for pedestrians. As an adjective it means "lacking wit or imagination." If someone calls your new poem pedestrian, they mean it's dull. If you want to impress your friends while also making them feel worthless, mutter "these people are SO pedestrian," at a party, loud enough for everyone to hear.</p></div>`;
