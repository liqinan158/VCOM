The word is often capitalized, especially when it's used in the form "the <i>Reverend</i> so-and-so." In the early 15th century, it meant "worthy of respect," a meaning that's sometimes still used today, and by the late part of that century it was being used for clergy members too, though it was earliest spelled <i>reverent</i>.</p></div></div>`;
