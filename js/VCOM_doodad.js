You might say that your sister collects <i>doodads</i> she finds on the beach and keeps them in glass jars.</p><p class="long">It's handy to have an all-purpose term for those things you can't quite name, either because you've forgotten or just don't know what to call them. Ask your aunt what she sells in her little shop, and she might say, "Oh candles and soap and various <i>doodads</i>." In Britain, the more common word is <i>doodah</i>, and both words emerged in the early 20th century.</p></div></div>`;
