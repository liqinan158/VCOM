If you add 10 to 15, then 10 is the <i>addend</i>. You can also call an <i>addend</i> a <i>summand</i>.</p><p class="long">When it comes to addition, the numbers you're working with are addendsâ€”the equivalent in multiplication would be called <i>factors</i>. If you're adding 7 to 112, the 7 is an addend and the second number is officially called an <i>augend</i>, although you'll rarely hear anyone except a math teacher use either of these terms.  The Latin root of <i>addend</i> is <i>addere</i>, "to add to, join, or attach."</p></div>`;
