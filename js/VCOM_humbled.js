A <i>humbled</i> sports star might be one who addresses the public after being punished for cheating.</p><p class="long">Your favorite basketball team is humbled if they lose badly to one of the worst teams in the league, and your schoolmate is humbled after bragging that he had straight As, only to get a miserable report card. In both cases, the humbled person or group has been brought down to earth, or taken down a peg. They're a little bit embarrassed and a little bit subdued. The Latin root is <i>humilis</i>, "lowly," and literally, "on the ground."</p></div>`;
