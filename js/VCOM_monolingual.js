If you are <i>monolingual</i>, your chances of landing a job as a translator are pretty darn slim.</p><p class="long">Your whole family might be monolingual, while your best friend comes from a family that speaks Spanish at home and English at school â€” in other words, they're <i>bilingual</i>. Being monolingual can be limiting, since you can only communicate clearly with others who speak your language. Learning new languages and becoming bilingual (or even <i>multilingual</i>, speaking several languages) is also good for your brain. The Greek root <i>mono</i> means "one," and the Latin <i>lingua</i> means "tongue" or "language."</p></div>`;
