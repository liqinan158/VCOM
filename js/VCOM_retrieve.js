Lots of dogs love to <i>retrieve</i> tennis balls, bringing them back to you over and over again.</p><p class="long">You might retrieve your cell phone from the car, or the toys a baby throws repeatedly on the floor. You can also retrieve a memory from the recesses of your mind, or struggle to remember someone's name and then suddenly retrieve it. A <i>retriever</i> is a dog that's bred to bring things back â€” in fact, this is the word's earliest use, from the fifteenth century. The Old French root is <i>retreuver</i>, "find again," from <i>re-</i>, "again," and <i>trouver</i>, "to find."</p></div>`;
