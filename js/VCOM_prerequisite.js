If something is required in advance of something else, like if you have to take a beginning Spanish class before signing up for Spanish II, then it’s a <i>prerequisite</i>.</p><p class="long">Add <i>pre</i> meaning "before" to <i>require</i> and you have something that's "required before." (That's helpful when trying to spell <i>prerequisite</i>!) Prerequisites to be able to graduate from college can seem like a pain, but most schools offer some fun ways to fulfill them. For example, you can often meet the physical education <i>prerequisite</i> by taking bowling.  Prerequisites aren't just for school: “The most called-upon prerequisite of a friend is an accessible ear,” said Maya Angelou, the American poet.</p></div></div>`;
