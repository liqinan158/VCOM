Don't forget your <i>knapsack</i> when you head out on that hiking trip!</p><p class="long">You can also call a knapsack a "backpack" or a "rucksack." The word <i>knapsack</i> is thought to be the oldest of these terms, and while "backpack" is more often used today in the U.S., <i>knapsack</i> is more common in Canada. It comes from the German <i>knappen</i>, "to bite," and some experts believe that the name evolved from the fact that soldiers carried food in their knapsacks.</p></div></div>`;
