It will take some <i>retrospection</i> to remember your favorite moments from the last year or two.</p><p class="long">You might be familiar with the word <i>introspection</i>, which is all about the act of thinking about yourself — the things you do, the way you are, and the things you think about. <i>Retrospection</i> is similar — both words are rooted in the Latin <i>specere</i>, "to look at." Instead of <i>intro-</i>, "within," <i>retrospection</i> uses <i>retro-</i>, "behind," or "in past times," so your retrospection at your high school graduation might have you thinking back on your years of school.</p></div></div>`;
