If you walk through a dense forest after it rains, it's really <i>luxuriant</i> with green plants overgrowing the paths.</p><p class="long">Natural, growing things are luxuriant when they're fertile and full of life. People and places that show a fullness of life and wealth are also luxuriant. If you enter a room full of deep, plush couches and expensive decorations you're in a luxuriant space. And anything really enjoyable to the senses — whether costly or not — can be luxuriant, like a really rich and creamy piece of warm vanilla cake with a large hot chocolate: that's <i>luxuriant</i>.</p></div></div>`;
