For example, you might see raindrops ripple on top of a puddle. <i>Ripple</i> was first used in the 1670s to describe something that causes a ruffled surface, sort of like how water seems to momentarily gain texture as it's stirred. <i>Ripple</i> later came to describe a very small wave, but you've probably heard of the "ripple effect" in which tiny waves spread, setting off more and more waves.</p></div>`;
