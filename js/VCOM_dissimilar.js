By now, you've probably figured out that <i>dis</i> at the beginning of a word tells you the word means the opposite of whatever comes after. That rule holds here. <i>Dissimilar</i> is the opposite of <i>similar</i>. You've probably heard that you should not use double negatives. Well with <i>dissimilar</i>, it's okay to say something like, "Art is not <i>dissimilar</i> to music in that it is a creative activity. Here, "not dissimilar" means similar.</p></div>`;
