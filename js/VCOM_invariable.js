Something that varies changes or is made up of different kinds of things. When you add the prefix <i>in-</i>, meaning "not," and the adjective suffix <i>-able</i>, you get an adjective to describe something that's not able to vary or change. Synonyms for <i>invariable</i> include <i>constant</i>, <i>fixed</i>, and <i>immutable</i>. Someone who's invariable in her habits may seem predictable and boring on the one hand, and steady and reliable on the other.</p></div>`;
