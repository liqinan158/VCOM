You don't have to be an etymologist to find yourself caught up in <i>logomachy</i>, but you have to care about words and their meanings.</p><p class="long">You and your word-loving friends might engage in logomachy, if you argue about the Latin and Sanskrit roots of your favorite words. There's not much to disagree on when it comes to the rare word <i>logomachy</i> itself, though â€” in Greek, <i>logos</i> means "word," and the suffix <i>-machy</i> always means "battle" or "contest," from the Greek <i>makhe</i>, or "fight."</p></div></div>`;
