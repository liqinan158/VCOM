It was cobbled together in 1841 by British scientist Sir Richard Own, using the words <i>deinos</i>, meaning "terrible" and <i>sauros</i> meaning "lizard." All are goneâ€”at least in their original form, although it is thought they simply evolved into other, present-day animals. The word <i>dinosaur</i> is often used for someone who is old-fashioned or unable to adapt to modern times.</p></div></div>`;
