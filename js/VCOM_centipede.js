If you can bring yourself to look closely at a <i>centipede</i>, you'll see its body is divided into segments, each having one pair of legs.</p><p class="long">Most people assume that centipedes are insects, but they're actually arthropods, tiny invertebrate animals with exoskeletons and segmented bodies â€” and a seriously squicky number of legs. The profusion of little legs is what gives the centipede its name; the Latin is <i>centipeda</i>, "many-footed arthropod," from <i>centum</i>, "hundred," and <i>pedis</i>, "foot." Despite their name, centipedes can have anywhere from 30 to over 300 legs.</p></div>`;
