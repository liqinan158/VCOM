The last time <i>petticoats</i> were popular was in the 1950s and 60s.</p><p class="long"><i>Petticoat</i> has had a variety of meanings over the years. In North America, it's an undergarment worn at the waist beneath a long skirt, but in other countries it's also been used to mean any skirt or a visible layer over an existing skirt. During the mid-19th century, petticoats were used to give a huge amount of bulk and shape to the skirt. As the word implies, the original petticoats were actual coats worn under a knight's armor.</p></div>`;
