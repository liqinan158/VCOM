If you like reading fantasy novels, you've probably encountered plenty of knights and <i>maidens</i> â€” and maybe even a dragon or two.</p><p class="long">These days, you will hardly ever see this word used to mean an unmarried woman, except maybe humorously. However, you will see it used when discussing the maiden voyage of a ship or plane: in both cases, the word indicates youth and inexperience. Also, the maiden name of a married woman is her name before marriage, a name many women keep after marriage too. There is also a meaning of <i>maiden</i> in the baseball-like British game of cricket.</p></div>`;
