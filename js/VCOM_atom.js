When you see the chemical formula for water, H2O, it's telling you that each molecule of water is made up of two <i>atoms</i> of hydrogen and one <i>atom</i> of oxygen.</p><p class="long">In science class, you've probably come across <i>atoms</i>, the bits that make up molecules. Less scientifically, the word <i>atom</i> can also mean a very small piece of anything at all. The Greek root of <i>atom</i> is <i>atomos</i>, which means "indivisible," since the scientists who first gave the <i>atom</i> its name imagined it couldn't be split or divided into smaller pieces. Even though we know there are smaller things that make up an atom (protons, neutrons and electrons), it's still a good way to think about the word <i>atom</i>.</p></div>`;
