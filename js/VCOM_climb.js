var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">climb</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>climb</i> is to go higher. When you ascend a mountain, you <i>climb</i> it, and when a song rises in popularity, it <i>climbs</i> the charts.</p><p class="long">To climb something generally takes hard work, which is clear when you watch a toddler climb a jungle gym or a mountaineer climb a sheer rock wall. You can also climb things metaphorically, like when a soldier climbs the ranks from corporal to major. Prices can climb too, when they get higher, and you can climb a social ladder when you meet well-connected people at parties. The Germanic root is <i>klimban</i>, "go up by clinging."</p></div>`;
