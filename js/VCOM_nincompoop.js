It's definitely not a compliment.</p><p class="long"><i>Nincompoop</i> is a silly-sounding word that's also kind of old-fashioned, like <i>ninny</i>. No one has any solid idea where it came from, and anyone who claims otherwise is, well, a nincompoop. By definition, nincompoops are dumb, foolish, and can't do anything right. But there are far worse things you could call someone who's behaving like an idiot. Maybe this old-timey insult deserves a revival?</p></div></div>`;
