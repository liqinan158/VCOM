You can also describe a more earthbound savior as <i>messianic</i> â€” you might say that after a long, hot soccer match, your mom's arrival with a cooler full of water bottles seems almost messianic. The adjective comes from the noun <i>messiah</i>, which has an Aramic root, <i>meshiha</i>, or "the anointed of the Lord."</p></div></div>`;
