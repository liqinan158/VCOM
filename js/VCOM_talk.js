In a movie, a hero being tortured by bad guys might be told that they will "make him talk," which means they want him to reveal secret info. Someone who is "the talk of the town" is being gossiped about by everyone. If someone says, "We need to talk," it often means they have bad news for you. Anytime people are conversing, chatting, or blabbing, they're talking.</p></div>`;
