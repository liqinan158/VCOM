The most famous use of the word occurs in the Christian Bible, when God grants people <i>dominion</i> over other animals.</p><p class="long">If you know the word <i>domination</i>, then you won't be surprised that <i>dominion</i> also has to do with a type of ruling over others. This is an old-fashioned and Biblical-sounding word for having power. A king has dominion over his kingdom. You'd never say the President has dominion, because we live in a democracy. Dominion implies more power than that â€” even absolute power. A dominion can also be an area or territory controlled by a larger country or state.</p></div>`;
