These two words have something else in common - both are contractions from the 14th century English expressions <i>do on</i> and <i>do off</i> respectively. Don your boots before going out in the snow and doff them when you come inside again! A don is also a Spanish nobleman and a dean of a college at Oxford or Cambridge, but these meanings come from the Latin <i>dominus</i> meaning "master."</p></div></div>`;
