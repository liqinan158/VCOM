You might consult a sports <i>almanac</i> for the coming year's scheduled games, or information on your favorite (or least favorite) player.</p><p class="long">The background of the noun <i>almanac</i> is somewhat hazy, with some suggesting it came from the Greek <i>almenichiakon</i> and others suggesting it came from the Spanish-Arabic <i>al-manakh</i>, both meaning "calendar." The astronomical almanac was once a book of permanent tables, with the annual version appearing in the 16th Century. Perhaps the most famous almanacs were Benjamin Franklin's <i>Poor Richard's Almanac</i>, and the <i>Farmer's Almanac</i>, published continuously since 1792, which offers weather predictions as well as astronomical tables and gardening tips.</p></div></div>`;
