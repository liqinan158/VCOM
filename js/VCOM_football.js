American <i>football</i> is played with an oval ball and the <i>football</i> players tackle each other. In the rest of the world, <i>football</i> is actually soccer. A <i>football</i> also refers to the ball itself.</p><p class="long">Football is a game in which players, wearing helmets and protective padding, run while holding the ball and pass by throwing it to teammates, and occasionally try to kick the ball through the goalposts. Players also smash into each other, hence the helmets and padding. Soccer, also known as football, involves players kicking the ball with their feet â€” only the goalkeeper can touch it with her hands. In both sports, at some point a foot hits the ball.</p></div>`;
