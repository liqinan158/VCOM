var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">subvert</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you <i>subvert</i> something, your words or actions criticize or undermine the usual way of doing something or common values. The girl who wears a tuxedo to the prom might <i>subvert</i> traditional ideas about beauty.</p><p class="long">To subvert an institution like a school or a government is to overthrow it or stop its normal way of functioning. <i>Subvert</i> comes from the Latin word <i>subvertere</i>, which combines the prefix <i>sub</i>, under, and the suffix <i>vertere</i>, to turn. So you can imagine something that subverts as overturning or flipping the usual way of doing things, like a student who subverts a teacher's authority, causing chaos in the classroom.</p></div></div>`;
