Your family's <i>permissiveness</i> might mean that you don't have chores, a specific bedtime, or a curfew â€” unlike your friends with strict parents.</p><p class="long">Sometimes people use this word to imply that there's too much lenience; they might talk about the permissiveness of schools nowadays, allowing students to use their phones in class or call teachers by their first names. When norms and rules change in a society, this often results in more permissiveness. It was once considered unseemly for women to wear pants, and changing fashions were seen as permissiveness. The Latin root, <i>permittere</i>, means "to let go or let loose."</p></div></div>`;
