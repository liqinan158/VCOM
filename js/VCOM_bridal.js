A <i>bridal</i> bouquet is the arrangement of flowers the bride carries during a wedding ceremony.</p><p class="long">Usually the word <i>bridal</i> describes anything having to do with a bride, like the bridal veil or the bridal party, or the bride's friends and family. Sometimes <i>bridal</i> refers to the newlywed couple, like the bridal suite they might stay in at a hotel on their honeymoon. Remember, <i>bridal</i> has nothing to do with horses â€” that's <i>bridle</i>, which sounds the same but means part of a harness.</p></div></div>`;
