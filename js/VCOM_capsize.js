Don't rock the boat, baby, or you might just <i>capsize</i>.</p><p class="long">When a boat tips over in a lake, it capsizes, and so does a boy who is sitting on an inner tube when it flips suddenly. Anything overturning in a body of water can be said to capsize. Sometimes vessels that capsize can be righted, like a canoe, and other times they sink to the bottom of the sea. The origin of <i>capsize</i> is uncertain, though it may be related to the Spanish word <i>capuzar</i>, "sink by the head."</p></div>`;
