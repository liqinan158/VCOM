The first <i>photographs</i> were created on metal plates coated with a special chemical.</p><p class="long">Although <i>photography</i> as we know it did not emerge until the 19th century, the word <i>photograph</i> evolved from the ancient Greek words <i>phot-</i>, "light," and <i>graph-</i>, "writing," which were combined to create the word for taking pictures — "light writing." Nowadays we take our photographs with electronic cameras, recording, transferring, and storing the pictures digitally. Times change, and while many people still enjoy using film cameras, they are becoming increasingly rare, and certain types of films are no longer produced.</p></div></div>`;
