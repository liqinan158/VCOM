Pretzels that come in a bag are crisp and small, while the soft kind is often sold from food carts and topped with mustard. The pretzel was originally a German invention, so it makes sense that the word comes from the German <i>Brezel</i>, which is rooted in the Medieval Latin <i>brachitella</i>, "biscuit in the shape of folded arms."</p></div></div>`;
