A <i>large-scale</i> study of the benefits of dark chocolate would require many people and lots of time. And lots of chocolate.

A large-scale military campaign is one that might attack on multiple fronts. Cartoon villains who want to take over the world commit large-scale crimes. A large-scale commercial farm is gigantic, cranking out tons of food. The opposite of large-scale is small-scale.</p></div></div>`;
