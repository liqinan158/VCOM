You might be afraid to fly, but the odds of a plane crash are so low that such an event is improbable. <i>Improbable</i> also means something that is so outrageous that you'd never admit you believed in it. You know the existence of the Loch Ness Monster is improbable, but that doesn't stop you from looking for it when you travel to Scotland.</p></div>`;
