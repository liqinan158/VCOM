Teenagers who are warned not to leave the house after nine PM might consider sneaking out to be forbidden fruit, and little kids are likely to long for the forbidden fruit of the sharp scissors they're not supposed to touch. The expression comes from the Garden of Eden story in the Bible, in which Adam and Eve eat the fruit they've been forbidden by God to taste.</p></div></div>`;
