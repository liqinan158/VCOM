While <i>lumpy</i> oatmeal might be good, a <i>lumpy</i> mattress can make it impossible to get a good night's sleep.</p><p class="long">It's easier to play a game of croquet on a smooth lawn, rather than a lumpy field full of bumps and holes. And you may find a silky bowl of chocolate pudding delicious, but be disgusted by the texture of a lumpy serving of tapioca pudding. The adjective <i>lumpy</i>, by way of the noun <i>lump</i>, comes from the Old English <i>lumpe</i>, from a Scandinavian root.</p></div></div>`;
