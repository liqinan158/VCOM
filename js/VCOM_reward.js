If you study hard for that vocabulary test, an "A" might be the <i>reward</i> in your future.</p><p class="long">You can use <i>reward</i> as a verb, as when the mayor rewards a firefighter who saves a family from a terrible blaze, or as a noun, to talk about the actual payment or item that's given to the firefighter. People often offer a reward for the return of lost or stolen things, like bicycles or jewelry or dogs. <i>Reward</i> meant "a regarding" or "an observation" in the 1300's, but it soon came to mean "repayment for some service."</p></div>`;
