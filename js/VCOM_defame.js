To <i>defame</i> is to gossip, even if the story is made-up, with the goal of hurting someone's image.</p><p class="long">We usually think of fame as a positive thing. Love, admiration, and people wanting to be like you — it all comes with the territory. The <i>de-</i> in <i>defame</i> means "remove." So if someone tries to defame a person, fame — or a good reputation — is taken away. Celebrities protect themselves from those who want to defame them, arming themselves with lawyers.</p></div>`;
