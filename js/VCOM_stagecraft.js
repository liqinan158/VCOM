If you're a musical theater buff, you might be inspired by the <i>stagecraft</i> of musicals like <i>Hamilton</i>, <i>The Lion King</i>, and <i>Wicked</i>.</p><p class="long">The term <i>stagecraft</i> covers everything from the writing of a play to its staging, set design, and lighting. <i>Stagecraft</i> sometimes specifically means "skill at staging plays," and you might even hear it used to refer to film production.
