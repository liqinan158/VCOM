var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">nanny</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>nanny</i> is a full-time babysitter, someone whose job is taking care of a family's children. If you're a lucky kid, your <i>nanny</i> will be like Mary Poppins or Maria from "A Sound of Music."</p><p class="long">Being a nanny goes beyond hourly childcare â€” a nanny is usually the person who spends the most time with a baby or child. A nanny might feed, bathe, play with, and otherwise care for a toddler, or drive an older child to ballet lessons. Most nannies work in the child's home, sometimes even living there. A completely different definition of <i>nanny</i> is "female goat." The word's origin is probably as a nickname for <i>Ann</i>, a generic woman's name, though it's also traditionally used for "close female adult," such as an aunt.</p></div>`;
