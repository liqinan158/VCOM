Are your curls a mess? You might want to apply some <i>pomade</i> to tidy them up.</p><p class="long">Now mostly thought of as old-fashioned, pomade is still around and used by those who want a slicked-back or wet-look hairdo. Unlike modern hair products such as spray, gel, and mousse, pomade doesn't dry. You can even keep pomade in your hair through several washings, because it's so waxy. The word itself comes from the Italian word for "apple," <i>pomo</i>, thanks to the inclusion of mashed apples in the original pomade recipe.</p></div>`;
