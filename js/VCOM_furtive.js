This is apparent as the expressions "to give someone a <i>furtive</i> glance" and "to steal a glance at someone" mean the same thing. If a person's manner is furtive, he or she is acting suspiciously. <i>Secret</i>, <i>stealthy</i> and <i>sly</i> are all similar in meaning, but they lack this image of a thief's actions.</p></div>`;
