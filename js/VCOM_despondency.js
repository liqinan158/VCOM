If you're in a state of <i>despondency</i>, you're feeling hopeless and super bummed out.</p><p class="long">Despondency is one of many emotional states that are not pleasant — it's a kind of extreme sadness. Stubbing your toe wouldn't trigger despondency, but the death of a family member or friend might. When people lose their jobs or experience failure, despondency can happen — they feel <i>despondent</i>. Despondency can include not only sadness, but feelings of hopelessness. It's a terrible way to feel, and it's not easy to get over it.</p></div>`;
