Between its annoying bites and its ability to spread disease, the <i>mosquito</i> is not the most popular of insects (unlike the fair ladybug).</p><p class="long">Male mosquitoes feed on nectar and live only a few days, while females need to feed on blood in order for their eggs to develop and be laid. Female mosquitoes, therefore, can be a nuisance on summer evenings, and can even be downright dangerous in tropical areas where they often spread diseases like malaria. In Spanish, <i>mosquito</i> means "little gnat," from <i>mosca</i>, "gnat or fly."</p></div>`;
