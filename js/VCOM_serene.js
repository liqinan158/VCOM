If you tell someone horrible news and they remain <i>serene</i>, you might wonder if they heard you!</p><p class="long">Related to the Latin word <i>serenus</i> "peaceful, calm, clear," <i>serene</i> was originally used in English, as in Latin, to describe calm weather. By the mid 1600s, however, it was used figuratively to describe a calm, untroubled person as well. Though people show their emotions pretty openly today, Victorian novels are full of characters who remain serene no matter how terrible the news.</p></div>`;
