Depending on your budget, if you are building a new house, you will get the <i>construction</i> of a castle, a house, a cottage, or a shack.</p><p class="long">The word construction has its roots in the Latin word <i>construere</i>, which itself has roots in <i>com-</i>, meaning "together," and <i>struere</i> meaning "to pile up." In addition to the building of property, the noun <i>construction</i> also refers to the building trade itself. If you work for a company that builds things — from offices to houses and bridges to dams — you work in construction, whether you are a carpenter at the work site or the secretary who schedules the jobs.</p></div></div>`;
