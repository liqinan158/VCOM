Radioactive energy, or radiation, is made up of active particles or electromagnetic waves. Nuclear waste is radioactive, but so are more ordinary things, like cell phones and the food we eat. The French word for it is <i>radio-actif</i>, which was invented by Pierre and Marie Curie, who combined <i>radiationem</i>, Latin for "a shining" with <i>actif</i>, French for "active."</p></div>`;
