The open <i>rancor</i> in political discussion prevents cooperation between political parties.</p><p class="long">The most helpful way to remember <i>rancor</i> with all its dark, miserable bitterness is to think of how <i>rancor</i> rhymes with canker, as in canker sore, the horrible painful burning on your lip. Or, you might want to remind yourself that <i>rancor</i> has its roots in the word rancid meaning "rotten." <i>Rancor</i> refers particularly to the sort of ill-will associated with resentment, envy, slow-brewing anger, and a very personal sort of hatred.</p></div></div>`;
