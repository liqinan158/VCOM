A bank robber might leave his hostages tethered together in the vault, and you might keep your fence-jumping dog tethered to the porch when she's out in your yard. The root word is the Old Norse <i>tjo√∞r</i>, tether, which was used only as a noun to describe the rope that ties animals until the late 15th century, when the verb form developed.</p></div></div>`;
