If the opera is a success, nobody mentions the libretto. Often, the libretto of an opera or musical is called the "book" and refers to all the parts of the script except the music. This can be helpful in remembering what the word means, because <i>libr-</i> is Latin for "book" (as in "library").</p></div></div>`;
