It’s much more fun than a deathboat. Large ships usually have enough <i>lifeboats</i> for every passenger on board. Hear that, Titanic?</p><p class="long">When the giant ship Titanic sank, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone. If you’re on a ship that’s going down, a lifeboat (one word) could save your life. Some lifeboats are made of hard materials like fiberglass, while others are inflatable. Another kind of lifeboat is launched from shore or a Coast Guard ship to rescue people who need help at sea, if, for example, they're on a sinking fishing boat.</p></div>`;
