Some things should never be left unstructured, like a schedule for building a house or a timeline for retirement.</p><p class="long">A popular phrase that's currently associated with this adjective is <i>unstructured time,</i> which is another way of saying "there's nothing on the schedule." Unstructured time might encourage daydreaming, creativity, or stress management, but for extremely organized people who like to follow schedules and have everything in order, unstructured anything can make them feel lazy or crazy.</p></div></div>`;
