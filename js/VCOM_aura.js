Get your glasses fixed and you'll see the <i>aura</i> emanating from her head isn't her special powers — just your bad eyes.</p><p class="long">You may have heard the noun <i>aura</i> used to describe the atmosphere surrounding something magical, like a fairy, or around a living being, like the calm vibes emanating from a meditating yogi. But did you know that it can refer to the sensation — one of coolness or bright light — that’s experienced before the onset of a seizure or migraine? <i>Aura</i> can also apply to the force that some people believe radiates from living organisms as an indicator of their unique essence.</p></div></div>`;
