By looking at a <i>pie chart</i>, you can quickly understand what proportion of the whole each section represents.</p><p class="long">Pie charts are one way to look at statistical information â€” they're so simple that they can make it easier to comprehend data. Each section is shaped like a slice of pie, and together they make up a whole "pie." If one "slice" represents twelve percent of the whole, it will be narrower than the "slice" that represents twenty-five percent. The earliest such charts were first used in the 1800s, though they weren't named <i>pie charts</i> until the 1920s.</p></div></div>`;
