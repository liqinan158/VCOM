Judges, umpires, and teachers should all strive to practice <i>fairness</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Fairness</i> comes from the Old English <i>f√¶ger</i>, meaning "pleasing, attractive." This makes sense given that the word is also used to describe physical beauty.  Fairness can refer to someone's good looks, or if someone is very pale and blond, you might notice the fairness of her complexion. When someone shows fairness is making a decision, he is pleasing all parties involved and offering a solution that is attractive to everyone.</p></div></div>`;
