Before you put your clean sheets and towels away in the closet, you should probably <i>fold</i> them.</p><p class="long">Some people drop their clothes on the floor at the end of the day, while others neatly fold theirs. You can call the crease in a folded piece of paper or pillow case a <i>fold</i> too. There are several ways to fold, including to gently mix ingredients, incorporating them without stirring; and to drop out of a poker hand, laying your cards down on the table.</p></div></div>`;
