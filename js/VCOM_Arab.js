You might describe your Egyptian pen pal as an <i>Arab</i>.</p><p class="long">Whether someone describes himself as an Arab — rather than a Persian or Kurd, for example — has to do with his language, culture, where he lives, and his ancestors. Someone who lives in Yemen is likely to call herself an Arab, while a Moroccan might consider herself to be a Berber. It is much safer, and less likely to cause offense, to describe people by the countries they're from. In Arabic, <i>'arab</i> means "inhabitant of the desert."</p></div>`;
