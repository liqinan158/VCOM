You could become a <i>disgruntled</i> employee if your boss swipes all your best ideas without giving you credit (or a raise).</p><p class="long"><i>Disgruntled</i> actually comes from <i>gruntle</i>, an old verb meaning, not so surprisingly, "to grunt." When you're disgruntled, you might grunt with dissatisfaction and anger.  If you are a disgruntled customer, why not ask to speak to a manager? Unless you'd rather just stand there grunting.</p></div>`;
