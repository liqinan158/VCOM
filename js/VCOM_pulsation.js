Anything that throbs this way is also pulsation, like the when the car stereo is turned up so loud you can feel the beat of the music through the soles of your feet. <i>Pulsation</i> comes from the Latin <i>pulsationem</i>, "a beating or striking," and its root meaning "to thrust, strike, or drive."</p></div>`;
