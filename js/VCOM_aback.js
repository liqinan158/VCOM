You might be taken <i>aback</i> when your grandmother suddenly demonstrates her yodeling skills.</p><p class="long">When you see the adverb <i>aback</i>, it almost always follows the verb "to take." When you're taken <i>aback</i>, you're startled, often by another person's actions. If someone makes a rude comment at a dinner party, for example, you'll be taken aback. The word dates from about 1200, and it comes from the Old English <i>on b√¶c</i>, "at or on the back." It was first used as a nautical term for a strong wind flattening the sail against the ship's mast.</p></div>`;
