It's a common item of furniture in dining rooms, a place where tablecloths, napkins, dishes, and silverware are stored. The name shares its root with <i>credence</i>, which today means "acceptance of something as true," but originally meant "testing food for poison before serving it," once a necessity in royal households. And the credenza?  It was the table on which food was set before being tested.</p></div></div>`;
