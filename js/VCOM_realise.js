Brits spell this word with an "s," while Americans will replace the "s" with a "z."

If you realise a plan, you make it happen.  If you realise a fact, you see its truth.  If you realise the seriousness of a situation, you become aware of its dangers. Since this word was originally borrowed from the French <i>réaliser</i> (meaning "make real"), we can understand why the Brits spell it r-e-a-l-i-s-e with an "s."</p></div>`;
