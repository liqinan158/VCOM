If one math class gets a pizza party and another gets an algebra quiz, that's <i>inequitable</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>inequitable</i> is a fancy way to say "unfair." It adds the prefix <i>in-</i>, or "not," to <i>equitable</i>, "fair and impartial." In law, inequitable conduct has to do with lying or withholding information during the process of suing someone. In more ordinary circumstances, if your brother complains that his half of the cookie you split is smaller, you can shrug and tell him, "Sometimes life is inequitable."</p></div></div>`;
