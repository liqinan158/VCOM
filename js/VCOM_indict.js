The grand jury <i>indicted,</i> the man on 12 counts of murder. Although it's true the boy had stolen cookies from the cookie jar in the past, that is no reason to <i>indict</i> him out of hand in the present case. There were no witnesses and the crumb evidence would suggest someone else committed the crime.</p></div></div>`;
