You may prefer the look of a nearly bare Christmas tree, adorned only with tiny white lights, while your sister prefers copious amounts of tinsel and ornaments. <i>Adorned</i> comes from the verb <i>adorn</i>, and its Latin root <i>adornare</i>, which means "furnish or provide" and also "decorate."</p></div></div>`;
