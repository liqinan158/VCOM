Its Greek roots translate to “contrary opinion,” and when two different opinions collide in one statement or action, that’s <i>paradoxical</i>.  In Shakespeare’s play "Hamlet," Hamlet’s mother marries the man who killed Hamlet’s father, but she doesn’t know it.  As Hamlet plots to kill the murderer to protect his mother, he says this paradoxical phrase: “I must be cruel to be kind.”</p></div></div>`;
