We get the word from French, which got it from a foolish comic character in Italian commedia dell'arte, <i>Pantalone</i>. It sounds old-fashioned now, but long ago most men wore pantaloons, loose trousers that gathered near the knee. As time went on, the word <i>pantaloon</i> was shortened in the United States to <i>pants</i>.</p></div>`;
