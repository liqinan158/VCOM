var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">sell</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>sell</i> is to exchange a thing or a service for money. You could <i>sell</i> lemonade from a table on the sidewalk, or <i>sell</i> hotdogs at a baseball game.</p><p class="long">When a business or store carries certain products for purchase, they sell those things; a car lot sells automobiles, and a bookstore sells books and magazines. Sometimes people say that an item "<i>sells</i> at" or "<i>sells</i> for" a certain price: "Normally, those candy bars <i>sell</i> for a dollar each." When something sells out, it's totally gone, but when a person sells out, they give up their principles for money or popularity.</p></div></div>`;
