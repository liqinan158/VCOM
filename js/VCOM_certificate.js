Your most prized possession might be the <i>certificate</i> you got when you became a black belt in karate.</p><p class="long">Your fastidious friend might need to check the health inspection certificate before she'll agree to eat in a restaurant, and you'll need a copy of your birth certificate before you can apply for a passport. A certificate certifies or documents the fact that you are who you say you are, that you're licensed to drive, or authorized to practice dentistry, for example. You can trace the word <i>certificate</i> back to the Latin <i>certus</i>, "sure, fixed, settled."</p></div></div>`;
