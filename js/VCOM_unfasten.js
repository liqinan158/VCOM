You should wait to <i>unfasten</i> your seatbelt until the car has completely stopped.</p><p class="long">To <i>fasten</i> is to hook, close, or latch something, and to <i>unfasten</i> it is to undo it. You might unfasten your dog's leash so she can run free on the beach or unfasten the snaps and buttons on your jacket so you can take it off. You can also unfasten your ponytail, letting your hair down, or unfasten the latch on a gate. The Old English root word is <i>f√¶stnian</i>, "make fast or firm."</p></div></div>`;
