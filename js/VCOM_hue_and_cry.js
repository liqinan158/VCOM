If people are riled up and speaking out, there's a <i>hue and cry</i>.</p><p class="long">Originally, a hue and cry was a call, by the victim, for the police to go after a felon. Since then, this is any kind of clamoring. During the Watergate scandal, there was a hue and cry to impeach Nixon. Whenever there's a shooting incident, there's a hue and cry for gun control. When there's a terrorist attack, there's a hue and cry for better security.</p></div>`;
