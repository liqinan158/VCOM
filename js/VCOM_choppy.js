It's tricky for a beginner to sail in a <i>choppy</i> lake.</p><p class="long"><i>Choppy</i> usually describes what happens to the surface of a body of water during a storm. Strong wind blowing across a bay, for example, turns the water choppy and rough. Something with a jerky, abrupt way of moving or flowing is also <i>choppy</i>, whether it's a piece of music or a filmed scene in a movie. In the 1600s, a stormy sea was described as <i>chopping</i>, which had changed to <i>choppy</i> by about 1830.</p></div>`;
