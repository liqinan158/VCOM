var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">earthy</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The adjective <i>earthy</i> runs the gamut from "crunchy" to "crude." You could use <i>earthy</i> to describe bohemian fashion or a vulgar comedian. Just don't use it to describe our planet.</p><p class="long">Adding one letter <i>y</i> to <i>earth</i> changes <i>earth</i>'s status from a noun to an adjective. And what a versatile adjective it is! You could use it in a more literal way, like the "<i>earthy</i> smell" coming from the vegetable garden. Or, you could use it in a more figurative way â€” like to describe someone who wears Birkenstock sandals and grows her own bean sprouts. <i>Earthy</i> can also be used to describe someone who tends to be gross or vulgar, but this use of the word is somewhat euphemistic.</p></div>`;
