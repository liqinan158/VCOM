He may have a shiny bald patch on the back of his head or just extremely thin wisps of hair all over — either way, he's balding. Both <i>balding</i> and <i>bald</i> probably originated from the Celtic root word <i>bal</i>, which means "white patch or blaze," especially one that's found on a horse or another animal's head.</p></div>`;
