The distinctly brown-tinted photographs of the 19th century are also described as <i>sepia</i>.</p><p class="long">In both Greek and Latin, <i>sepia</i> means "cuttlefish." The ancient Greeks and Romans were the first to take advantage of the fluid these fish release when they're startled â€” it was prized as a pigment for both writers and artists. The word itself came to be used for both the pigment and its red-brown color. Antique sepia-colored photographs are so well known and popular that many modern photographs are deliberately edited to appear sepia-toned.</p></div></div>`;
