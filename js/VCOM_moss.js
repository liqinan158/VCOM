If you see a green furry rock as you hike in a forest, chances are that's <i>moss</i>.</p><p class="long">Moss forms mats and clumps in wooded spots, and it's unusual in the plant world for several reasons, including the fact that it has no seeds and no real roots. It reproduces through spores and absorbs water through its tiny leaves. Long ago, people used moss to insulate dwellings, but today it's primarily used in gardens. The Old English root is <i>meos</i>, closely related to <i>mos</i>, "bog," which is a damp area where moss might grow.</p></div></div>`;
