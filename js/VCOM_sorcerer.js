Sorcerers appear in many fantasy novels and Shakespeare plays. The word for a female sorcerer is <i>sorceress</i>. The Latin word <i>sors</i>, "fate or fortune," is at the root of <i>sorcerer</i>, which didn't come into popular use until after the 1940 release of the Disney film "Fantasia," which featured Mickey Mouse as the character "the <i>sorcerer's</i> apprentice."</p></div></div>`;
