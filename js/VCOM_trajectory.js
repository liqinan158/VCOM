The prefix <i>tra-</i> is short for <i>trans-</i>, which means "across" (think <i>transport</i> and <i>transit</i>) and the <i>ject</i> comes from <i>jacere</i>, which means "throw" and is also the root of the word <i>jet</i>.  If you wanted to describe the path of a jet through the sky, you could refer to the jet's trajectory.</p></div>`;
