Sometimes people have messages <i>engraved</i> inside their wedding rings, their iPods, or any other rock-hard surface that can handle it.</p><p class="long">Words are engraved on tombstones to honor the people who died. <i>Grave</i> used to mean “to dig or carve” but no one uses it that way anymore because they would say <i>engrave</i> instead. Anytime a hard surface has a message or picture cut into, it was engraved. Sometimes engraving isn’t physical. A super fun birthday when your long lost grandmother rode in on a stallion could be engraved in your mind forever. Both kinds of engraving leave an impression.</p></div>`;
