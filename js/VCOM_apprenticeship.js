Carpenters, masons, doctors, and many other professionals often learn their trade through <i>apprenticeship</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>apprenticeship</i> comes from the Old French <i>aprentiz</i> meaning "someone learning" and the Anglian suffix <i>-scip</i>, meaning "state, condition of being." An apprenticeship is when someone is in a state or condition of learning from a master in a field.  Some professions even have apprenticeship programs like the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers where you can be assigned to apprentice, or study under a professional electrician.</p></div>`;
