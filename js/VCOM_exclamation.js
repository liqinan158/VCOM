An <i>exclamation</i> is usually followed by an <i>exclamation</i> point. Go Figure.</p><p class="long">The shocked cry you made when your friends jumped out and yelled, "Surprise!" at your birthday party? You could call both your yelp and their "Surprise! exclamations. The Latin word <i>exclamare</i>, or "cry out loud," is at the root of the noun <i>exclamation</i>. An exclamation doesn't need to be a literal "cry," though â€” it can be a surprised "Wow!" or an angry "No!" Anything you say with abrupt excitement, pain, fear, or anger is an exclamation.</p></div></div>`;
