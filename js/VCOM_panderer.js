This word is not a compliment. If someone in class calls you a <i>panderer</i>, maybe stop bringing the teacher apples every day.</p><p class="long">A panderer is someone who tries to please others, not to help them but for an ulterior motive. A panderer kisses up to get something. A panderer is sometimes vulgar. Politicians are often panderers, especially the ones who say or do anything to get a vote or raise money. Pandering is dishonest because the panderer says what they think others want to hear, not what they really believe.</p></div></div>`;
