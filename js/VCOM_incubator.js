Sometimes very tiny infants need to spend a little time in an <i>incubator</i> before they're ready to leave the hospital.</p><p class="long">Incubators are used in hospitals, but you'll also find them on farms, where they keep eggs warm before they hatch, and then protect the baby chicks. A biologist uses another type of incubator, one that controls the temperature for growing microbes or cells in a lab. Because all incubators help something grow and develop, businesspeople also use the term to mean a place or equipment that's available to help a new business get off the ground or grow larger.</p></div>`;
