If you believe in <i>animism</i>, you believe that ostriches, cactuses, mountains, and thunder are all spiritual beings.</p><p class="long"><i>Animism</i> comes from the Latin word <i>anima</i>, meaning life, or soul. People often think of "primitive" beliefs when they think of animism, but you'll find the belief in the spiritual life of natural objects in all major religions. If you have ever felt that a star is more profound than a cluster of hot rock or gas a long way away, then you have a sense of what animism is.</p></div></div>`;
