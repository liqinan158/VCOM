In modern society, we're generally <i>nude</i> in the shower but fully dressed when we go to work.</p><p class="long">Whether you say you're "in your birthday suit," "au naturel," or "unclothed" â€” when you're nude, you're naked. You might find the word in the phrase "in the <i>nude</i>," which also simply means nude, or describing a work of art as "a <i>nude</i>," or a painting or sculpture of a nude person. In the 1500s, <i>nude</i> was a legal term meaning "unsupported," from the Latin <i>nudus</i>, "bare." The "naked" definition didn't became popular until the nineteenth century.</p></div>`;
