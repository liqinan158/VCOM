If you spend a lot of time working on your <i>coiffure</i>, you spend a lot of time in front of the mirror fixing your hair.</p><p class="long">The word <i>coiffure</i> originally meant hairstylist, now it means the style. The word implies an elaborate style, not just a regular haircut. A beehive hairdo, for instance, would be rightly called a coiffure. A military-style buzz cut is just a trim. The word can be shortened to coif, but be careful as this word has other meanings as well.</p></div>`;
