Something that's sectarian follows the rules of a particular group or sect, and it's the Latin word <i>secta</i> that's at the root of both <i>sectarian</i> and <i>nonsectarian</i>. The literal meaning of <i>secta</i> is "a way or a road," and its figurative meaning is "a following, school of thought, or religious group."</p></div>`;
