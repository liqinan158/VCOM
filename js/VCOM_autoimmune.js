Lupus is one example of an <i>autoimmune</i> disease.</p><p class="long">Your immune system sends out antibodies to attack bacteria and viruses that shouldn't be in your body. When this system mistakenly attacks substances that are meant to be in your body, it can cause all kinds of problems â€” this is an autoimmune disorder. <i>Autoimmune</i> is a medical term that's been around since the 1950s, from <i>auto-</i>, "self," and <i>immune</i>, "exempt from a disease."</p></div></div>`;
