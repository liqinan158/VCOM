The word entered English from French <i>demettre</i> which means "to dismiss," from the Latin word <i>mittere</i>, meaning "let go, send." And you might think, after reading this quote from E. Phillips Oppenheim, that <i>demise</i> sounds somewhat old-fashioned: "That my <i>demise</i> would have been a relief to you I can, of course, easily believe, but the means â€” they surely were not worthy of your ingenuity."</p></div></div>`;
