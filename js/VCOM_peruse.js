But informally, it can have the opposite meaning, to read something casually and quickly.</p><p class="long">To understand the two meanings, think about the way people like to talk about doing things thoroughly, even when they aren't. If you are visiting a library or a bookstore, you might find yourself <i>perusing</i> the shelves. Synonyms are <i>browse</i> and <i>skim</i>. <i>Peruse</i> is from Middle English <i>perusen</i> "to use up," from the Latin prefix <i>per-</i> "thoroughly" plus Middle English <i>usen</i> "to use."</p></div>`;
