A worker's <i>wage</i> is how much money she makes. But when you <i>wage</i> something, you carry it out: for example, a warmonger is someone whose primary goal is to wage wars. The word is of Germanic origin, and it's related to both <i>gage</i> and <i>wed</i>, with their underlying meanings of "to pledge."</p></div>`;
