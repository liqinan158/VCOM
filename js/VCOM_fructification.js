During <i>fructification</i>, a pear tree will first grow fragrant blossoms before they develop into delicious pears.</p><p class="long">When a plant undergoes fructification, you can also say it <i>fructifies</i>, or develops so that it can produce fruit. Both words stem from the Latin <i>fructificare</i>, "bear fruit," and its root <i>fructus</i>, which means both "fruit" and "profit or enjoyment." You can use <i>fructification</i> in this figurative way too, to mean "make productive." You might say, "The fructification of my lemonade stand means I can pay you back for all that sugar I borrowed!"</p></div>`;
