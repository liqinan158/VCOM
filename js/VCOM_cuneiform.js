Back in Mesopotamian times, you would have written by carving wedge-shaped characters that make up a language called <i>cuneiform</i>. From the shape of the characters, we get the adjective <i>cuneiform</i>, which means "wedge-shaped," like a cuneiform platter. <i>Cuneiform</i> also describes wedge-shaped bones, like those found in the lower leg.</p></div></div>`;
