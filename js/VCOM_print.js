If you <i>print</i> your name, you don’t write it in cursive. You write it so someone can actually read it.</p><p class="long">When something's "in <i>print</i>," it's been published. Another kind of print, besides text (letters, numbers, and characters), is the impression left by a finger (a fingerprint), a foot, or even an animal's paw. The verb to <i>print</i> means to write in clear, block letters, or to publish a copy of a book, newspaper, or magazine. If something's "out of <i>print</i>," it's hard to find because no one is publishing new copies of it.</p></div>`;
