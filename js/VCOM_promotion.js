If you create an advertising <i>promotion</i> that increases sales of spray jeans in a can, for example, you might get a <i>promotion</i> to company vice-president.</p><p class="long">Words that start with <i>pro-</i> usually hint at something positive or forward moving, and a <i>promotion</i> is a moving up or a motion forward. A product promotion pushes the item out in front so it gets more exposure, and a work or school promotion raises your salary or moves you up a grade. If youâ€™re in the military a promotion means a higher rank, with more people under your command, and the same happens if you earn a promotion in a club or organization like the scouts.</p></div></div>`;
