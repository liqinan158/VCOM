When you have a long paper to write, you might want to settle into a <i>carrel</i> with your books and laptop.</p><p class="long">A <i>carrel</i> is a cubicle or alcove which contains a desk and chair, and sometimes a shelf and electric outlets. Carrels are perfect study spots for college students, but anyone who uses a library can sit in a carrel to read or write. The word comes from the Medieval Latin <i>carula</i>, "small study in a cloister," possibly from a Latin root word meaning "ring."</p></div>`;
