A <i>watchful</i> dog might keep an eye on the sidewalk in front of your house all afternoon.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>watchful</i> is good for describing someone who keeps an attentive eye on things. A watchful teacher, for example, knows immediately when a student is being teased, and a watchful driver is quick to stop for a pedestrian crossing the street. When you're on the lookout, you're being watchful. The word comes from the Middle English <i>waccheful</i>, which used to have an alternate meaning of "wakeful" or "sleepless."</p></div></div>`;
