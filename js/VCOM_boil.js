Cooks boil stuff all the time on the stove; geysers and hot springs boil naturally. And if you spill boiled red cabbage on the new white couch, mom's temper might just boil over. So you see <i>boil</i> can be used both literally and figuratively — to depict boiling hot liquids or boiling hot tempers.</p></div>`;
