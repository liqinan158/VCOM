A <i>counterculture</i> might organize itself around opposition to war or unusual ideas about raising children, for example.</p><p class="long">A counterculture is at odds with, and sometimes in direct opposition to, the prevailing norms â€” this was the case at the beginning of the anti-war "hippie" counterculture that formed in the 1960s as a protest against US involvement in the Vietnam War. The term first emerged around this time in Theodore Roszak's 1969 book "The Making of a Counter Culture."</p></div></div>`;
