If you can't stand listening to your brother <i>munch</i> his toast in the morning, you might decide to take your breakfast to go.</p><p class="long">When you eat something steadily, especially if it's something crunchy, you munch. You might munch on carrot sticks for a snack and then munch a grilled cheese sandwich for lunch. You can also take a munch, or a bite, out of something. <i>Munch</i> is an imitative word, its sound echoing the actual sound of munching, but it may also have a connection to the Old French <i>mangier</i>, "to bite or chew."</p></div>`;
