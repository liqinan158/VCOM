People with <i>dysgraphia</i> have trouble writing coherently.</p><p class="long">Bad news nearly always follows when <i>dys-</i> begins a word, and so it does here: <i>dysgraphia</i> is an inability to write coherently, either as a learning disorder or a result of brain damage or disease. The Greek roots mean "difficult writing." If you have dysgraphia, you might be able to write a little, but what you write wonâ€™t make much sense. Oddly, someone with dysgraphia may speak fine, since speaking and writing are controlled by different parts of the brain.</p></div></div>`;
