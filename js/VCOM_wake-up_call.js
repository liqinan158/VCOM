You can arrange for a wake-up call when you're traveling, or ask your friend for an informal one on the mornings you both wake up early to go for a run. A figurative wake-up call is a sudden, clear warning that something bad is going on: "All those cavities were a real wake-up call about eating so much candy."</p></div>`;
