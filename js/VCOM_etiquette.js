If you practice proper <i>etiquette</i>, you are less likely to offend or annoy people — and you may even charm them.</p><p class="long">Many people think etiquette is about table manners in fancy restaurants, but quite simply, it is expected behavior that shows respect, meant to make everyone feel comfortable. For example, an etiquette book will tell you to bring a little gift when you are a dinner guest in someone's home, especially if it is your first visit — you know what is expected of you, and your gift shows respect and gratitude.</p></div>`;
