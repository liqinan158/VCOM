There's also a sense of slowness, casualness, and a lack of worry, like getting an easy "A" in your History of Hip Hop class. <i>Easy</i> comes from the Old French word <i>aisie</i>, "comfortable, rich, well-off," an easy way to live indeed. The only thing about <i>easy</i> that's less than simple is remembering to change the <i>y</i> to an <i>i</i> for variations like <i>easier</i> and <i>easiest</i>.</p></div></div>`;
