If you admire your friend's <i>arrangement</i> of his living room furniture, you might go home and make a similar <i>arrangement</i>.</p><p class="long">Your brother might keep an arrangement of Lego creations on his desk, and you could put an arrangement of wildflowers in a vase in the middle of your kitchen table. Another kind of arrangement is one you make when you negotiate an agreement with another person: "We have an <i>arrangement</i> â€” she gives me a ride to school and I walk her dog in the afternoon." The Old French root, <i>arengier</i>, means "to set in a row."</p></div>`;
