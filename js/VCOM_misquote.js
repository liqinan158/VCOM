It's unethical for a journalist to deliberately <i>misquote</i> the subject of an interview.</p><p class="long">It's extremely common for people to misquote famous figures like Gandhi (who never literally said, "Be the change you wish to see in the world") and Machiavelli (who didn't exactly say, "The ends justify the means"). These examples can also be called <i>misquotes</i>. As with many words, Shakespeare is credited with being the first to use this combination of <i>mis-</i>, "wrong," and <i>quote</i>, "repeat or copy out exact words."</p></div>`;
