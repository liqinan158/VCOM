If you experience a <i>blackout</i>, it's helpful to have flashlights and candles handy.</p><p class="long">During a war or an energy crisis, a city may impose a blackout on its citizens, requiring them to turn off all lights and, during bombing raids, to cover windows and limit activity. There is also a figurative kind of blackout, when a government suppresses information deliberately, not allowing newspapers and TV stations to report what's really happening. Someone who faints or passes out experiences yet another kind of <i>blackout</i>, a loss of consciousness.</p></div></div>`;
