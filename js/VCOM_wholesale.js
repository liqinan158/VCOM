When <i>wholesale</i> is a verb, it has a very different meaning â€” to sell things in bulk, usually to someone who is going to sell it again at a higher retail price. The earliest meaning of the word was "in large quantities," combining <i>whole</i> and <i>sale</i> into the phrase "by whole sale."</p></div>`;
