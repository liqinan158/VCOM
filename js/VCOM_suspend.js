Whether itâ€™s your judgment, a rule, or bus service, when you <i>suspend</i> it, you temporarily bring it to a halt.</p><p class="long"><i>Suspend</i> often describes stopping an activity for a while. A winter storm, for example, may suspend air travel until weather conditions improve. <i>Suspend</i> also works in a more figurative sense, such as when you <i>suspend</i> your doubt in order to give someone or something a fair chance. A student who is suspended is temporarily forbidden from attending class. Don't confuse this with <i>expel</i>, which means he or she may never return.</p></div></div>`;
