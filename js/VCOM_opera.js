It consists of recitatives which provide the narrative plot line and elaborate chorus singing, along with duets and arias, which are the parts we most remember.</p><p class="long">We get the word <i>opera</i> from the Latin and, later, from the Italian, a noun formed from the word <i>operari</i>, "to work." The style evolved in Italy around 1600, and was initially unrealistic, mainly a chance for soloists to show off. In the mid-18th Century the focus shifted to both strong story and exquisite singing. Emotion is an important quality, a trait carried over to "soap operas" which have no singing but plenty of fake tears.</p></div></div>`;
