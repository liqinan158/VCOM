You'll often come across this word in a religious context â€” the Latin root <i>haeresis</i>, "school of thought or sect," was used by Christian writers to mean "unorthodox sect or belief." This comes from the Greek <i>hairesis</i>, "a taking or choosing," from <i>hairein</i>, "to choose." A person who chooses to believe in heresies is called a <i>heretic</i>.</p></div>`;
