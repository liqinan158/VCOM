It's probably <i>pesto</i>, a delicious combination of garlic, basil, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, and pine nuts.</p><p class="long">The traditional version of pesto, invented in Genoa, Italy, is salty and garlicky, and it's made by crushing all the ingredients by hand using a mortar and pestle. The word <i>pesto</i> itself comes from this technique â€” its root is the Italian <i>pestare</i>, "to pound or crush." If you want to be absolutely sure you're getting this original, authentic version in an Italian restaurant, you can specify <i>pesto alla genovese</i>, or "Genoese pesto," when you order.</p></div>`;
