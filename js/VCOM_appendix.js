After all, our bodies have been around a lot longer than books have. But you'd be wrong. The name for the organ, also known as <i>vermiform appendix</i>, came into use later, no doubt because it is something attached — as its Latin root is translated — to the intestines just as an appendix is attached to the end of a book.</p></div>`;
