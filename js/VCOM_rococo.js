If you love tons of decoration and fancy details, then you'll love the <i>rococo</i> style of architecture and music.</p><p class="long">Modern design is all simplicity: clean lines and no clutter. Rococo design — which came and went in Europe in the 1700s — is the opposite: it explodes with detail, ornament, patterns, and decoration. If something other than an actual work of design or music is described as <i>rococo</i>, it means wildly detailed, to the point of excess. They sat me next to Diana, who told me the whole rococo story of her divorce. Hours had passed before she even got to the part about the affair.</p></div></div>`;
