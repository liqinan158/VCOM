He's showing you his <i>contumacious</i> side, meaning he's stubbornly resisting authority.</p><p class="long">You might hear the word <i>contumacious</i> used in a courtroom to describe an uncooperative witness or someone who willfully disobeys an order given by the court. If you have a glove compartment full of unpaid parking tickets, when you finally land in court your disobedient behavior may cause the judge to tell you that you're a contumacious lout. You'll not only have to pay the tickets, you'll also be slapped with a big fine, and you'll never be contumacious again.</p></div></div>`;
