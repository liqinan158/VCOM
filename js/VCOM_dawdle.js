The point of <i>dawdle</i> is that one is moving too slowly, is falling behind, or is not properly focused on making progress.</p><p class="long">One way to remember the meaning of <i>dawdle</i> is that it rhymes with "waddle," as in, "a duck waddles." Imagine what would happen if you waddled instead of walked. It would take a lot more time, and your companion might say, "Don't dawdle!" <i>Dawdle</i> implies not only taking extra time but actually wasting it. A leisurely walk in the woods is one thing, but if you have to get to the theater on time, don't dawdle along the way: you'll miss the curtain!</p></div></div>`;
