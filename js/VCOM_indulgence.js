Buying yourself something that you don't need, be it a cookie, video game, or diamond necklace, is an <i>indulgence</i>.</p><p class="long">If you allow yourself to eat more chocolate cake or watch more TV than is really good for you, those are your little indulgences. If you spend your life savings on a trip to Tahiti, thatâ€™s a huge indulgence. If someone says to you, "Grant me this indulgence," prepare for a long-winded story that tries to convince you of something. Long, long ago the Catholic Church sold something called "indulgences": pardons for sins.</p></div></div>`;
