Did you leave your boat untied at the dock? Careful â€” it might drift out to sea. There's also a figurative way to be untied, like when your untied thoughts drift freely through your mind before you fall asleep. When you're reading or writing this adjective, it's easy to mistake it for <i>united</i>, which means "joined as one."</p></div>`;
