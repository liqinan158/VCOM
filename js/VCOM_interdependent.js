As business becomes more and more international, the world is increasingly <i>interdependent</i>, with countries needing each other's help to survive.</p><p class="long"><i>Interdependent</i> comes from the Latin word <i>inter</i> meaning "among, between," and <i>dependere</i> which means "to hang from, be dependent on." When two people are interdependent, they have a sense of dependency between them. Married couples are often interdependent. They rely on one another — whether for income or child care or love — to get by.</p></div></div>`;
