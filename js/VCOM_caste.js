The word arrived in English through the Portuguese <i>casta</i>, which means "race" or "lineage," and was first used in the 1700s in reference to Hinduism's system of social stratification. By the nineteenth century, though, this noun was used metaphorically to describe any type of group that resembled this, as in the example, "Some sought to abolish the privileges enjoyed by an elite <i>caste</i> of business and financial leaders."</p></div></div>`;
