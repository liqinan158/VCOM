You might put on a <i>variety show</i> with some talented friends who can juggle, sing, dance, and tell jokes. Bravo!</p><p class="long">The earliest variety shows were performed on stages and radio. In the U.S., the first popular variety shows involved the comedy and music of vaudeville. Their format varied, but the key was the word <i>variety</i> â€” any variety show included an assortment of diverse entertainment all mixed together. The invention of television spurred dozens of popular variety shows, from The Ed Sullivan Show in the 1940s and 50s to The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour in the 1970s.</p></div>`;
