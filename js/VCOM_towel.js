What they have in common is absorbencyâ€”they're made to soak up liquids. You can also use <i>towel</i> as a verb: "The dog is soaking wet! Towel her off before you let her on your bed!" And when you've utterly given up on something, use the boxing-related phrase "throw in the towel."</p></div></div>`;
