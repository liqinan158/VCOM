Some people use a <i>sauna</i> at the gym or pool, where they sit and relax, enjoying the cleansing heat. If there’s a separate steam room, then the <i>sauna</i> provides dry heat.</p><p class="long">In many Scandinavian countries, saunas are very common — in Finland, it's not unusual to have a sauna in or attached to your house. People who enjoy saunas find the steam, usually created by pouring water onto hot rocks, to be very relaxing and to have health benefits as well. The word <i>sauna</i> is Finnish, used to refer to both the structure of the room and the steam bath itself.</p></div></div>`;
