It acts as an incentive to help sell the product. If your new cell phone came with a <i>rebate</i>, you'll get a check in the mail for a certain amount of the cost.</p><p class="long">A well-known rebate occurred in 2007 when President George Bush issued tax rebate checks to many people in America, giving back some of what each person paid in taxes. <i>Rebate</i> comes from the Old French word <i>rabattre</i>, meaning "beat down, drive back." <i>Rebate</i> can also be used as a verb that refers to giving a reduction in price during a sale. For example, your internet provider might rebate your bill for three months to keep you as a customer.</p></div></div>`;
