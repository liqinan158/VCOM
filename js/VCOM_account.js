It can also be a business arrangement, like a bank <i>account</i> or an email <i>account</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Account</i> is one of those seemingly simple words that have a mass of different meanings. An account can be a narrative or story — a biography, for example, is an account of someone's life. <i>Account</i> can also mean an explanation of something, as in the phrase, "How do you <i>account</i> for that?" An account is also a handy arrangement whereby a store agrees to provide you goods on credit, but then you might have to account for all that debt.</p></div>`;
