However, <i>gustatory</i> has its roots in the Latin <i>gustare</i>, meaning "to taste," while <i>gust</i> can be traced back to the Old Norse <i>gustr</i>, meaning to "to gush." But if a gust of wind brings with it the savory aroma of a nearby backyard barbecue, you might find yourself licking the air in gustatory frustration.</p></div>`;
