If you want to <i>rankle</i> a cat, try splashing it with water and then putting it in the bathtub.</p><p class="long"><i>Rankle</i> goes back to the French verb <i>rancler,</i> which comes from an old word for "festering sore," which paints a pretty negative picture of what it means to <i>rankle</i>. A sore that festers gets worse and worse, or more infected, and if you rankle someone, they will get more and more angry. "Ankle" rhymes with <i>rankle,</i> and if you were to prank a friend and hold him by his ankles over a trash can every day for a week, it would definitely rankle him.</p></div>`;
