A lot of things can be described like that. The Amazon jungle is stratified — with massive trees up high and shrubbery below. The division between rich and poor people is an example of a stratified society. And when you spread peanut butter onto bread, and then add jelly on top of that, well, sure, that’s a stratified sandwich.</p></div>`;
