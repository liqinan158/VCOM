If you talk about a golden time or a golden opportunity, you mean something marked by luck, peace, and happiness. In Old English, it was common to add the suffix <i>-en</i> to mean "made of," but <i>golden</i> is one of just a few of these words in modern English (including <i>wooden</i> and <i>waxen</i>).</p></div>`;
