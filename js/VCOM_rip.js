It's almost always better to <i>rip</i> off a Band-Aid than to peel it off slowly.</p><p class="long">You can rip a piece of paper in half, or rip a hole in the roof of your tent. When you tear, split, or pull something apart, you rip it. You can also rip figuratively â€” like when your move to a new city rips you apart from your best friend. A <i>rip off</i> is a bad deal or a swindle, a phrase that's been popular since about 1970, although <i>rip</i> meaning "steal" was used as prison slang much earlier.</p></div>`;
