The word also refers to the plant life of a particular era — for example, fossilized plants can help us determine the <i>flora</i> at the time of dinosaurs.</p><p class="long">The use of the word <i>flora</i> as referring to a particular area's vegetation has been used by botanists since the 1640s, but it became common with Swedish botanist Linnaeus, who in 1745 wrote "Flora Suecica," a study of the plant life of Sweden. The word was a natural fit, as Flōra was the name of the Roman goddess of flowers. When scientists study a region's flora, they classify their findings and create a descriptive list, which is also called a <i>flora</i>.</p></div></div>`;
