Some examples of <i>jabber</i>? You know, like when someone has a hobby that you don’t really care about or understand but they won’t quit talking about it? Yeah, they <i>jabber</i>. Or your best friend is relating, without end, his excitement about the coming tiddlywinks championship and you comprehend neither the game nor its importance? That friend <i>jabbers</i>, too.</p></div>`;
