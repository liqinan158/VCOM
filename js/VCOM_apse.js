You'll most often find an <i>apse</i> in a church.</p><p class="long">In Gothic, Romanesque, and Byzantine Christian churches, it's very common to find a semicircular area with a vaulted ceiling, often topped by a dome, on the east side of the building. This is generally where the altar is located, making the apse the most important section of the building. The word comes from the Latin <i>apsis</i>, "arch or vault," and the Greek root <i>hapsis</i>, "arch or loop."</p></div></div>`;
