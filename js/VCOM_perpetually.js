Although there might be some things that might exist perpetually, like the universe (hopefully), we usually use <i>perpetually</i> for things that just feel like they're never going to end. If the coffee shop you go to is perpetually playing the same album, bring them a new one. A good synonym is <i>incessantly</i>.</p></div>`;
