In writing, it's almost always the ocean or the sea that's described this way, since the deepest areas of these are still mostly unfathomed, even today. You can also use it figuratively: "I can't understand the <i>unfathomed</i> depths of his poetry." A <i>fathom</i> is a unit of measure mostly used for water.</p></div>`;
