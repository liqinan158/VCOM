Talk incessantly about your accomplishments on the clarinet or amazing ability to wiggle your ears, and people are going to think you’re <i>conceited</i>.</p><p class="long">An offshoot of <i>conceit</i>, <i>conceited</i> was first recorded in 1600 as meaning “having an overwhelming opinion of oneself.” It’s a shortened form of “self-conceited” and the total opposite of "modest." In a remark about such vain people, the English Victorian novelist George Eliot once said, “I've never any pity for conceited people, because I think they carry their comfort about with them.”</p></div></div>`;
