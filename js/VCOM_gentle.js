Nowadays you’re more likely to hear the word used to refer to things that are calm, moderate, and without harshness. The word is often applied to people, but it can be used more broadly to describe anything that is mild, such as "a <i>gentle</i> detergent" or "a <i>gentle</i> reminder."</p></div></div>`;
