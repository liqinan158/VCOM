The name became attached to artists who moved to low-rent neighborhoods and who seemed to share the outsider status or spirit of the Romani. Although <i>bohemian</i> still carries traces of its edgy past, it can now be used to describe a fashion statement — such as pairing clogs with a floaty peasant blouse.</p></div></div>`;
