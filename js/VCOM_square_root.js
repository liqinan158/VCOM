In other words, five is the <i>square root</i> of 25 because five times five equals 25.</p><p class="long">When you learn about square roots in mathematics, you begin with simple problems like the square root of 49 or the square root of 64. These problems are relatively easy to solve, because the answers are whole numbers: seven and eight, respectively. Solving for square roots has been around nearly as long as math itself â€” there is evidence of calculations of square roots in ancient Egyptian and ancient Indian documents.</p></div></div>`;
