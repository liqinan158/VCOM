Apparently back in the 17th century a lot of people tended to promote their nephews to powerful positions at the expense of other candidates. <i>Nepotism</i> has come to mean favoritism of any family member, so if you’re the daughter of a powerful CEO, don’t worry, you can still be the beneficiary of nepotism. However, people might not like you when you become the Vice President, unless you’ve really earned the title.</p></div>`;
