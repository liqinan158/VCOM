The Latin root is <i>excommunicare</i>, meaning "put out of the community," which is just what happens when a person is excommunicated. The term is used most often in churches whose traditions include the concept of communion, as another Latin meaning of <i>excommunication</i> is "to expel from communion."</p></div>`;
