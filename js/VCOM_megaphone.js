You can bring a <i>megaphone</i> to a football game, but leave it at home if you are headed to a dinner party.</p><p class="long">Megaphones are useful, portable devices for someone who's guiding a group of protesters, for a movie director who's working with a lot of actors on a large set, or for cheerleaders who want their voices to carry over the roar of a crowd of football fans. Thomas Edison invented the megaphone, and he probably named it too: it combines the Greek <i>megas</i>, "great," with <i>phone</i>, "voice."</p></div></div>`;
