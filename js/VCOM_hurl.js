You might <i>hurl</i> your shoe at a horrible bug if it suddenly scuttled across the floor.</p><p class="long">If you hurl a rock at a glass window, it will probably break, and if you hurl your trash in the direction of a garbage can, it may or may not land inside. The verb <i>hurl</i> implies some force behind your throw. The earliest English version was <i>hurlen</i>, which in the thirteenth century meant "run against each other or collide." It probably comes from the Germanic root <i>hurr</i>, which is also the root of <i>hurry</i>, and means "rapid motion."</p></div></div>`;
