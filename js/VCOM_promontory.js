A <i>promontory</i> is just the kind of thing a heroine will threaten to throw herself off of if the love of her life does not return to her.</p><p class="long">A promontory can be a foreland, headland, or rocky cliff. Think Irelandâ€™s Cliffs of Moher jutting into the sea. Connect <i>promontory</i> with <i>prominent,</i> "important or sticking out," <i>project</i>, "estimate forward" and <i>protrude,</i> "stick out," which also carry this sense of jutting out. In anatomy, <i>promontory</i> can refer to a projecting part of the body.</p></div></div>`;
