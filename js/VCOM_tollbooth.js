In the classic novel <i>The Phantom Tollbooth</i>, a boy drives his toy car through a magical <i>tollbooth</i> and is transported to a strange land.</p><p class="long">If your car has a transponder, a special electronic device, you can drive slowly past a tollbooth and pay automatically, rather than stopping and handing money to a toll collector. Only toll roads or turnpikes have tollbooths â€” drivers pay based on the size of their vehicle, and the toll revenue contributes to maintaining the road. The oldest tollbooths, called <i>toll houses</i>, were built in England, Wales, and Scotland during the 18th century.</p></div></div>`;
