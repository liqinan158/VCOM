A party guest might <i>audaciously</i> grab all the candy from a pi√±ata without worrying what anyone thinks.</p><p class="long">When you take any kind of risk, you act audaciously: it's possible to audaciously dive off a cliff into a lake, or audaciously take the last piece of pie. If someone speaks audaciously, they say exactly what they're thinking, no matter the reaction. <i>Audaciously</i> comes from the Middle French <i>audace</i>, "boldness," with its Latin root, <i>audax</i>, which means both "daring" and "rash or foolhardy."</p></div></div>`;
