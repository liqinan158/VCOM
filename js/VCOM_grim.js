var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">grim</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Things that are gloomy, stark, ghastly, and somber are <i>grim.</i> Sunshine, puppies, and rainbows are not grim; zombies, reapers, and mummies are grim. Less scary things like drizzly, foggy days can also be called grim.</p><p class="long">Two famous uses of the adjective <i>grim</i> are the Grim Reaper and Grimm's Fairy Tales. Mr. Reaper shows up in movies and books wearing a long, hooded black cape and carrying a scythe, or long-handled blade used, in less grim circumstances, for mowing grass and reaping grain: he represents death. The real-life German brothers wrote some bone-chilling tales under their own name, Grimm, meaning "cruel, fierce," which is related to the English word <i>grim.</i>  Modern grim things include crime-drama images of dead bodies and characters in horror movies.</p></div>`;
