You might <i>fawn</i> over Bambi if you want to hang out with the cute and fuzzy gang.</p><p class="long">As a verb, <i>fawn</i> either refers to an attempt to get on someoneâ€™s good side, or, oddly enough, to give birth to a deer. If you're a human, fawning is an age-old art that might get you what you want but can be very unattractive. If you ever come into possession of a great fortune, watch out for sudden friends who want to fawn over you and shower you with presents. They probably have dollar signs in their eyes.</p></div>`;
