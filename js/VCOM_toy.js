Your favorite childhood <i>toy</i> might have been a dollhouse, a stuffed animal, or a set of blocks.</p><p class="long">Some toys are specifically designed for play, like a small wooden train set or a baby's shape sorter. You can also make toys out of everyday objects and materialsâ€”a piece of paper can take the shape of a toy airplane, and a saucepan can become a toy drum. Very small dogs are another kind of toy, like a toy poodle. When you use it as a verb, <i>toy</i> means "move or handle absent-mindedly."</p></div></div>`;
