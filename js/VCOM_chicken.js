Many cities allow people to keep a few <i>chickens</i> in their yards as pets and egg layers.</p><p class="long">You can talk about your pet chicken with its brown feathers and funny feet, but you might also use the word <i>chicken</i> to order dinner at a restaurant: "I'll have the <i>chicken</i>." When a person is described as a chicken, it means she's easily scared or a coward. The Old English <i>cicen</i>, "young fowl,"  is the source of <i>chicken</i>. Calling someone <i>chicken</i> for being frightened has been hurting feelings since the 14th century.</p></div>`;
