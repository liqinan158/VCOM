You can <i>abjure</i> a religious faith, you can <i>abjure</i> your love of another person, and you can <i>abjure</i> the practice of using excessive force in interrogation.</p><p class="long"><i>Abjure</i> is a more dramatic way to declare your rejection of something you once felt or believed. When you see its Latin roots, it makes sense: from <i>ab-</i> (meaning "away") and <i>jurare</i> ("to swear"). When you abjure something, you swear it away and dissociate yourself with it. You might abjure the field of astrology after receiving a bad fortune, or you might abjure marriage after a bitter divorce.</p></div>`;
