The organs, particularly the intestines, are collectively known as an animal's entrails, and it's more common to refer to them this way if they're visible or removed from the body. Sometimes the noun <i>entrails</i> is used to mean the inside of something else, like the entrails of a street that's been dug up and exposed. The Latin <i>interanea</i>, or "internal," is the root of <i>entrails</i>.</p></div></div>`;
