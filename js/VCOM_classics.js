Spend your days debating the philosophy of Plato and Cicero? Then you are a lover of the <i>classics</i> — the literary works of Ancient Greece or Rome.</p><p class="long">Some people choose to major in French, math or biology. Others take classes in the classics, since they are crazy for learning about the roots of western civilization. The classics include Ancient Greek and Roman philosophy, poetry, theater, epic tales, and mythology. Much like a movie that is considered <i>classic</i>, because it can be appreciated over time, the <i>classics</i> of Ancient Greece and Rome have been appreciated ever since — well, ever since the days of Ancient Greece and Rome. Notice that the word <i>the</i> often comes before <i>classics</i>.</p></div></div>`;
