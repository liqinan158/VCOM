Nervous flyers are generally overjoyed to put their feet back on <i>terra firma</i> after a rough airplane flight.</p><p class="long"><i>Terra firma</i> is used in literary and formal English, rather than everyday conversation, so save this phrase for when you’re writing a poem or delivering a dramatic speech. In the 1600s, <i>terra firma</i> primarily referred just to the section of Italy that was ruled by Venice at the time, but eventually it came to designate all of earth’s dry land, separate from the air or the oceans.</p></div>`;
