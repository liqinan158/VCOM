Taking revenge on someone instead of taking them to court is an <i>extrajudicial</i> punishment.</p><p class="long">If a prisoner is executed without an official trial in a court, it's extrajudicial, and if police officers shoot and kill a suspect instead of arresting him, that would also be extrajudicial. Both examples happen outside of the legal process, and without the checks and balances that the law provides. <i>Extrajudicial</i> comes from the Latin root words <i>extra</i>, "outside of," and <i>iudicalis</i>, "belonging to a court of justice."</p></div>`;
