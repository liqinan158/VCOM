Unless you herd sheep, you probably don't see many bellwethers that say "Baaa." That's the origin of this word, but there are many other types of bellwethers who lead the way in different areas. Apple was a bellwether in technology. Rosa Parks was a bellwether in civil rights. And, during election season, those "<i>bellwether</i> states" are the ones where the primaries seem to predict the outcome of a party's nomination.</p></div>`;
