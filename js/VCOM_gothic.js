Some famous writers of Gothic fiction include Charlotte Bronte, Mary Shelley and Edgar Allan Poe. Nowadays, though, if you refer to someone as "goth," you are not saying they write a good ghost story; you are commenting on their pale makeup, black fingernail polish and Victorian fashion. <i>Gothic</i> can also describe something barbaric, rude, and unenlightened as if from medieval times. This use of the word is usually capitalized. The word is from the Goths, a Germanic people who invaded the Roman Empire.</p></div>`;
