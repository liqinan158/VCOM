As a verb, <i>cube</i> means to cut into cube shapes. You can buy cookie dough that is ready for baking and formed into cubes. Place each cube on the cookie sheet, and the dough becomes a dozen round cookies â€” or fewer if you pop a cookie dough cube into your mouth before baking!</p></div></div>`;
