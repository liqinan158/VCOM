Other meanings of <i>scoop</i> come from the shape and motion of a scoop, which is hollowed out and looks kind of like a pocket. Also, if you pick up a little dog into your arms, you might say you scooped it up. <i>Scoop</i> is one of many words that can be a noun and a verb, even in the same sentence: when you go to an ice cream shop you can ask your server to give you one, two, or three scoops.</p></div>`;
