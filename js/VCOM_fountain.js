You might see a big <i>fountain</i> in front of a museum, or install a small one in your back yard.</p><p class="long">You can use the noun <i>fountain</i> any time you talk about a shooting flow of water, whether it's a deliberate, artificial piece of architecture or an accidental fountain caused by the faucet in your kitchen sink breaking suddenly, sending a fountain of water into the air. The earliest, fifteenth century meaning of <i>fountain</i> was "spring of water that collects in a pool," from the Latin root word <i>fons</i>, "spring of water."</p></div>`;
