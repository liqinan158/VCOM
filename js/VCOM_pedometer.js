You should get a <i>pedometer</i>, a portable device that measures every step you take.</p><p class="long">Break the word <i>pedometer</i> down into its roots and you get the Latin <i>ped</i>, or "foot," and the Greek <i>metron</i>, "a measure." That's exactly what a pedometer does: it measures each step your feet take. Most pedometers are small enough to carry with you while you walk, jog, or skip through your day, and they use the motion of your hand or hip to estimate how many steps you've taken.</p></div></div>`;
