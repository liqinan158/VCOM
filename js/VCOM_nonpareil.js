var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">nonpareil</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use <i>nonpareil</i> to describe someone or something that is beyond compare, an absolute model of perfection of a particular thing. Jane Austen was a writer <i>nonpareil</i>, and James Bond a spy <i>nonpareil</i>.</p><p class="long">Coming from the medieval French words <i>non,</i> meaning "not," and <i>pareil,</i> meaning "equal," so quite literally it means "not equal" or "unequaled." Like a lot of fancy French terms adopted by the English language (e.g., "<i>bons mots</i>," "<i>eminence gris</i>"), the use of <i>nonpareil</i> is generally restricted to written form. Use with caution.</p></div>`;
