Although it has other meanings, you should probably avoid it at all costs.</p><p class="long">This is a very strong word that should be avoided in nearly all situations: <i>fag</i> (short for <i>faggot</i>) is a hateful slur against homosexuals. Because <i>fag</i> is such an offensive word, the other meanings are uncommon, but fagging has also meant working hard and getting tired, as in <i>fagging out</i>. A fag — especially in England — is also a cigarette, and in British boys’ schools, fags are servants for older boys.</p></div>`;
