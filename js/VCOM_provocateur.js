Usually, a <i>provocateur</i> works for a police department or government.</p><p class="long">If police want to catch a criminal in the act, they might use a provocateur to induce the suspect to buy drugs, for example, so officers can swoop in and make an arrest. <i>Provocateur</i> is a shortened form of "agent <i>provocateur</i>," used since the late 1800s to mean "person hired to make trouble." When police officers pretend to join protests — such as those at political conventions — with the goal of inciting people to violence and then arresting them, they act as provocateurs.</p></div></div>`;
