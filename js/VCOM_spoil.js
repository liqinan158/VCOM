Food can also spoil, or become unsafe for eating, and you can spoil a child by always giving him everything he wants, making him unable to cope when things don't go his way. The word <i>spoil</i> comes from the Old French <i>espoillier</i>, to plunder. In fact, things taken by force are called spoils, like the spoils of war.</p></div>`;
