(Let's assume we're all <i>residents</i> of Earth.) It's where you were born or where you've lived for awhile. Doctors who have their medical licenses but need more training become <i>residents</i> of hospitals. Animals that don't migrate are <i>residents</i>, too. Although it's usually a noun, it can be an adjective, like in the horror movie no one wants to live in, "Resident Evil."</p></div></div>`;
