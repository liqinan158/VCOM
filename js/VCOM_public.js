You might say that the public is getting tired of the inefficient bus system in your city, or that the new library branch is open to the public. The adjective <i>public</i> is good for discussing things that concern everyone. The Latin root word, <i>publicus</i>, means "of the people, of the state, common, or ordinary."</p></div></div>`;
