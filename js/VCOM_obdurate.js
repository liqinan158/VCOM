If you want to major in English, but your parents are <i>obdurate</i> that you should go premed, they might go so far as to threaten not to pay your tuition.</p><p class="long">This adjective descends from Latin <i>obdurare</i>, "to harden." A near synonym is <i>adamant</i>, from Latin <i>adamas</i>, "hard metal, diamond." So both of these synonyms derive from the quality of hardness being associated with a stubborn personality.</p></div></div>`;
