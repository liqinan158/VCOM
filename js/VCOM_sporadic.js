The mail carrier comes every day but the plumber's visits are <i>sporadic</i> — he comes as needed.</p><p class="long">A specialized use of <i>sporadic</i> is to describe a disease that appears only occasionally in random cases, and is therefore not an <i>epidemic</i>.  Mostly, though, you'll hear this word used to describe anything that happens occasionally, like your family's sporadic trips to visit your distant cousins in Ohio or the sporadic bake sales your science club sponsors when it's low on funds. English borrowed the word <i>sporadic</i> from Greek <i>sporadikós</i>, "scattered."</p></div>`;
