A <i>penguin</i>! <i>Penguins</i> are flightless water birds, and the only place in the Northern Hemisphere where you'll find wild <i>penguins</i> is on the Gal√°pagos Islands.</p><p class="long">If you live north of the equator, your interactions with penguins are limited to zoos and aquariums. Penguins are distinctive because of their contrasting black-and-white coloring, their size, and the fact that they walk and swim but don't fly. Their wings have, in fact, evolved to act as flippers in the water. You might think of penguins as cold-weather birds, and many do live in Antarctica, but most are found in more temperate areas.</p></div></div>`;
