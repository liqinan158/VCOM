It’s also something sports fans love to do. At the Olympics, some Americans <i>chant</i>, “USA! USA! USA!”</p><p class="long">In addition to being something fans like to yell together, a chant is a traditional form in a lot of religious music. There are Catholic chants, Hindu chants, Jewish chants, and the list goes on. Because of this type of music, “to chant” means “to repeat something in a monotone or repetitive way.” Chants have no harmony or instruments, only a simple rhythm and a lot of repetition.</p></div>`;
