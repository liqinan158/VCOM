If you’re trying to prove that you didn’t eat the last cookie, you might <i>adduce</i> the fact that your dog’s mouth is covered in cookie crumbs.</p><p class="long">The word <i>adduce</i> comes from the Latin <i>adducere</i>, which means "to lead or bring along." If you were a lawyer, you might adduce, or bring forth, a witness in order to help your case. You might also adduce a piece of evidence, like a fact, to help with your argument. You might think of the word <i>add</i> to help you remember the definition of <i>adduce</i>: when you adduce something, you are adding to an argument by offering proof.</p></div></div>`;
