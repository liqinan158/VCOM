In the old days, women wore <i>peignoirs</i> when they knew they'd be seen in their night clothes.

The origin of this word is curiously related to a lady's long hair and the time at the end of the day when she would comb or brush it. The Middle French <i>peignouoir</i> means "garment worn over the shoulders while combing the hair," from <i>peigner</i>, "to comb the hair." The Latin root is <i>pecten</i>, "a comb."</p></div>`;
