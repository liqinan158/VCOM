Such dreariness, such whining sallow women, such utter absence of the <i>amenities</i>, such crass food, crass manners, crass landscape! What a horror it is for a whole nation to be developing without the sense of beauty, and eating bananas for breakfast.” As you can see, people throughout time have gotten cranky when they’ve felt their <i>amenities</i> to be lacking.</p></div>`;
