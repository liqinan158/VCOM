For example, most people crave a hug or a cup of hot cocoa every now and then, but it’s unusual to crave a new filing cabinet or tie rack — although if that’s how you feel, don’t let us interfere. Interestingly, <i>crave</i> comes from an Old English word meaning “demand.” Perhaps our ancestors were more assertive about getting what they wanted.</p></div></div>`;
