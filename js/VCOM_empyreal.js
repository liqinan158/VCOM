You might enthusiastically describe a beautiful sunset over the ocean as "an <i>empyreal</i> spectacle."</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>empyreal</i> isn't used very often, aside from poetic and religious writing. You might come across it in a poem, describing the summer sky in flowery terms, or in a more devout context to mean "heavenly." If you read the phrase "<i>empyreal</i> realm," it either means a divine paradise or a beautiful, awe-inspiring sky. The word <i>empyrean</i> is also correct, and both forms of the word come from the Greek root <i>empyros</i>, or "fiery."</p></div></div>`;
