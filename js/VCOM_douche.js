Since this is a slang word that some find disgusting and particularly offensive to women, be careful when using it. The d-word isn’t as bad as the f-word, but your mother or your teacher probably doesn’t want to hear about “That <i>douche</i> in my math class!” So it's probably best to keep your vocabulary <i>douche</i>-free.</p></div></div>`;
