You may <i>theorize</i> that your dog is afraid of loud noises after you see her cower under the bed during fireworks and thunderstorms.</p><p class="long">When someone theorizes, they're not just making a wild guess. They're forming a <i>theory</i>, or a testable explanation that they can confirm through experimentation. After a scientist theorizes and the theory sticks around and is tested again and again in a rigorous way, it becomes an "established theory," like the theory of gravity or plate tectonics theory. The Greek root <i>theorein</i> means "to consider, speculate, or look at."</p></div>`;
