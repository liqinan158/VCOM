Any time you are given directions or told how to do something you are receiving <i>instruction</i>.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>instruction</i> is related to the word <i>structure</i>; both share the Latin root <i>structus</i>, "built." The use of the word as we know it today appeared in the early 15th century from the Old French. Today it refers to the action of teaching and the job of a teacher. It can also be used to denote the directions themselves. Consider the word's connection with <i>structure</i>: effective instruction is presented in an orderly, structured manner.</p></div>`;
