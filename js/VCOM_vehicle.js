Even though the grocery store is only a few block away, you'll probably want to use a <i>vehicle</i> to get there, so you won't have to carry your groceries all the way home.</p><p class="long">A <i>vehicle</i> is anything that transports a person or thing, usually a car. But a vehicle can be a truck, a plane, a bus, a blimp or even a shopping cart, anything that transports people or things. <i>Vehicle</i> is also often used in the sense of a medium of expression. For example, if you're an artist, your art is the vehicle for your creative ideas. Some people believe that bread is just a vehicle for mayonnaise.</p></div></div>`;
