You can also describe each individual instance of flying as a flight: "I took a long flight to Sri Lanka this summer." Anything that's soaring through the air is in flight, especially if it has wings or is engineered to stay up there. As a noun, a <i>flight</i> is also one group or set of steps: "We had to carry her books up three flights of stairs."</p></div>`;
