If you and your best friend both like walking, mystery novels, and chocolate, and you both dislike jogging, science fiction, and Brussels sprouts, the two of you have <i>similar</i> tastes.</p><p class="long">The Latin root for <i>similar</i> is <i>similis</i>, meaning "like."  If two movies have similar plots, you might like one better because it has a better script or more interesting actors.  If you're tired of being told how similar you are to your long-haired, friendly mother, you could cut your hair.  Or start being rude.  Remember that <i>similar</i> ends in "lar" even though it might not sound like it.</p></div>`;
