It’s one thing to wear gold around your neck as jewelry, but <i>louche</i> to have all your teeth capped in the precious metal just for the heck of it.</p><p class="long"><i>Louche</i> is an adjective that describes something “of questionable taste or morality" but is also kind of attractive. It comes from the French <i>louche</i>, which also means “squinting,” and that word comes from the Latin <i>lusca</i>, meaning “one-eyed.” Imagine a <i>louche</i> pirate with an eye patch that you just can't turn away from. It's pronounced like a little kid trying to say "loose," like "loosh." You can also use <i>louche</i> in place of words like <i>decadent</i>, <i>shady</i>, and <i>sinister</i>.</p></div></div>`;
