Most <i>drums</i> are round, with a thin material stretched tightly over the ends.</p><p class="long">Some drums, like the West African djembe, are played with bare hands by a drummer who plays just one drum at a time. Others are found in a drum kit, often part of a rock band or a jazz ensemble, which might include a bass drum, a snare drum, cymbals, and a tom-tom â€” or even more. The word <i>drum</i> is also a verb, meaning "to play a <i>drum</i>," and can also mean "a cylinder-shaped container."</p></div>`;
