It's hard to see where you're going when you do the <i>backstroke</i>.</p><p class="long">If you swim competitively on a swim team, the backstroke is one of the four official strokes for racing. Some swimmers prefer the backstroke because it's easier to breathe than when you swim face-down, though it's harder to tell how close you are to the pool wall. You can also use <i>backstroke</i> as a verb: "I'll just <i>backstroke</i> over to the shallow end and say hi to my friend."</p></div>`;
