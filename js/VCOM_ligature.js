If you hit your head and need stitches, you'll go to the emergency room for <i>ligature</i>.</p><p class="long">Doctors and nurses are all well-trained in ligature (since they are always stiching people up), but they are not the only people familiar with ligature. When a robber ties up victims before robbing a store, the rope used to tie their hands is also a <i>ligature</i>, and when a musician connects two notes with a slur — singing or playing them as one syllable — that's a <i>ligature</i> too. The word comes from the Latin root <i>ligatura</i>, "a band," from <i>ligare</i>, "to bind."</p></div>`;
