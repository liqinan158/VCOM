If you want to tastefully spruce up your front yard, you might plant a flowering <i>shrub</i> or two â€” or maybe you're the type who would prefer some plastic garden gnomes.</p><p class="long">Shrubs are similar to trees with two exceptions: they are shorter and have more individual stems, rather than a wide, thick trunk. Some plants, like a hazelnut, can grow into either a shrub or a tree. You can also call a shrub a <i>bush</i>. The origin of <i>shrub</i> is a bit uncertain, but some experts believe it shares a Scandinavian root with the Norwegian <i>skrubba</i>, "dwarf tree."</p></div></div>`;
