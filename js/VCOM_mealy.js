Good cornbread is moist and cake-like, instead of dry and <i>mealy</i>.</p><p class="long">You'll usually find the adjective <i>mealy</i> describing food that doesn't taste great, whether it's an undercooked, mealy sauce or an overripe, mealy apple. In both of these examples, the food tastes dry and bland, and has a crumbly feeling on the tongue. Other mealy things might look like meal, like a mealy sandbox or the mealy bark of a tree. The Old English source of <i>mealy</i> is <i>melu</i>, "meal or flour."</p></div></div>`;
