And, if you nearly drop your dog's leash at a busy intersection, your heart might pound from the closeness of your best pal's brush with danger. An interesting detail about <i>nearly</i> is that it <i>nearly</i> ended up with a different meaning: until the late 1600s, in fact, it meant "carefully."</p></div>`;
