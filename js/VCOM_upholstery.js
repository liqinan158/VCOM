Upholstery consists of the material — including springs, padding, and fabric — that cover the bare bones of the furniture you sit on. If you have ever spilled a drink on a couch, someone might have yelled, "Watch out! You'll stain the <i>upholstery</i>!" People who put the upholstery on furniture are called <i>upholsterers</i>.</p></div></div>`;
