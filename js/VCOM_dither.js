You might <i>dither</i> about what to do if your two best friends invite you to parties on the same night.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>dither</i> implies not only that you're having a hard time deciding about something, but that you're upset or agitated about it. You might say to your friend, "Don't just pace around and <i>dither</i> about what to wear! We're going to be late!" In the 17th century, <i>dither</i> meant "quake or tremble," and by the early 1800s it came to mean both "vacillate" and "be anxious."</p></div>`;
