It would be <i>surprising</i> for most of us to get a phone call from the Queen of England.</p><p class="long">Unless you suspected your friend was planning something, the surprise party she throws for your birthday will be surprising. Things that are surprising take you aback or even confuse you a little bit. The adjective <i>surprising</i> comes from <i>surprise</i>, via the Old French <i>sorprendre</i>, "to overtake or seize." The original meaning of <i>surprise party</i> was a stealth military action.</p></div></div>`;
