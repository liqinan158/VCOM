A <i>seraphic</i> smile is sweet and angelic.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>seraphic</i> means "like a seraph," or similar to a high-ranking angel. People with gentle, innocent faces are often said to be seraphic, and any kind of dreamy music or art can be described the same way. The word dates from the 17th century, from the Church Latin <i>seraphicus</i>, originally from the Hebrew <i>seraphim</i>, which is thought to mean "the burning one," as seraphs were traditionally "flaming" angels.</p></div>`;
