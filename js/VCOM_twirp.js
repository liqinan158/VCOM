It's not nice to call someone a twirp, so you should save it for emergencies: "You <i>twirp</i>! Why'd you put my phone in the dishwasher?" One theory of <i>twirp</i>'s origin says it came from the name <i>T.W. Earp</i>, a controversial student union president at Oxford in 1911, while other experts believe the word didn't appear until the 1920s.</p></div></div>`;
