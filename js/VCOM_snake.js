var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">snake</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>snake</i> is a long reptile without legs that moves by undulating, arching the bones in its back and pushing against the ground. A pet <i>snake</i> is easy to care for, unless you're squeamish about feeding it mice.</p><p class="long">Like other reptiles, snakes are covered in smooth scales. Unlike most, snakes have flexible jaws that allow them to eat things much wider than their own narrow bodies â€” if you see a big lump in the middle of a garter snake's body, you can be pretty sure it's just eaten a mouse. Because so many people are afraid of snakes (the vast majority of which are not poisonous), the word has also come to mean "treacherous or deceitful person." <i>Snake</i> is a verb as well, meaning "move like a snake."</p></div>`;
