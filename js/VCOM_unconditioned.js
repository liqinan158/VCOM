Sneezing is an <i>unconditioned</i> behavior. <i>Unconditioned</i> also means without conditions, as in <i>unconditioned</i> love, which is love that will always be, even if your mate starts wearing socks with sandals.</p><p class="long">There are two sense of <i>unconditioned</i>, but they both involve things that happen regardless of outside events. An unconditioned behavior is innate â€” babies aren't taught (or conditioned) to cry, so that behavior is unconditioned. Other uses of <i>unconditioned</i> mean that something has no conditions and could last forever, like unconditioned peace, or even an unconditioned agreement that will be honored in any circumstances. No conditions can stop it.</p></div>`;
