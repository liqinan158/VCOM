A <i>statue</i> is a specific kind of sculpture, one that clearly represents a person, an animal, or other living creature.</p><p class="long">There's no question that the first thing most people think of when they hear the word <i>statue</i> is the Statue of Liberty. The woman's name is Liberty and there she is, a statue. Any sculpture that represents a person (Liberty, George Washington, Gandhi, or the Mad Hatter) is called a statue. In New York's Central Park, there is a much beloved <i>statue</i> of a dog named Balto, a heroic husky from Alaska.</p></div></div>`;
