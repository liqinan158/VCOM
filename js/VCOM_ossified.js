You might feel that your uncle has become an <i>ossified</i> suburban soccer dad, set in his unbending view of the world and comfortable lifestyle.</p><p class="long">When your habits or views have solidified into inflexible patterns — especially if those views are conservative — you can describe yourself as ossified. It's not a compliment to call someone ossified, since it implies an inability to change or bend or even to consider another person's viewpoint. The root is <i>ossify</i>, "to turn into bone," from the Latin word for "bone," <i>os</i>.</p></div></div>`;
