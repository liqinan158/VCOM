You might see a security <i>guard</i> at the mall, a crossing <i>guard</i> on the street outside a school, or a palace <i>guard</i> at Buckingham Palace.</p><p class="long">To <i>guard</i> something is to watch over it or keep it from danger. You should ask someone to guard your backpack when you go to the restroom at the restaurant â€” or take it with you. The verb <i>guard</i> also means to protect against unintended consequences. To guard against overeating at the party, you could have a light snack before you go, so you aren't as tempted by all the delicious snacks and desserts.</p></div></div>`;
