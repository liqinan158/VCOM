If you’re a bit of a book snob, steer clear of <i>commercial</i> fiction, which is written for the widest enjoyment.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>commercial</i> first appeared in the 1680’s, long before television <i>commercials</i>, which is probably what you think of when you hear the word. An <i>al</i> was added to <i>commerce</i>, and it meant "pertaining to trade." It wasn’t until the 1870's that <i>commercial</i> meant “done for the sake of financial profit,” and then later in the 1930's, the noun form was refined to describe “an advertisement broadcast on radio or TV.”</p></div></div>`;
