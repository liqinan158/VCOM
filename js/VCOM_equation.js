That's the mathematical meaning of <i>equation</i>, but <i>equation</i> can also be used in any number of situations, challenges, or efforts to solve a problem.</p><p class="long">The "equa" at the beginning of <i>equation</i> will be familiar from other words such as "equal," "equality," and "equate."  All of these words have to do with making things balance out. An <i>equation</i> is a statement of the equality of two quantities. If that <i>equation</i> is not a mathematical one but rather, say, an interpersonal one, it's still a situation in which you might try to make the two sides equal. For example, taking marriage out of the <i>equation</i> might make it easier for two people to decide to stay together for a while.</p></div></div>`;
