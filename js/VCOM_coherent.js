"I told you if you didn't do your homework you couldn't watch TV. You didn't do your homework so you can't watch TV." This is a <i>coherent</i> argument (and annoying as well).</p><p class="long">The thing about such coherent arguments, as your Mom well knows, is that they are also easily and clearly understood. If someone speaks coherently, they are speaking clearly and lucidly. A slight variation on the meaning comes in the sense of something that is united clearly as a whole and a recognizable entity. You might say, for example, that New York City is a "culturally <i>coherent</i> region" within the United States.</p></div></div>`;
