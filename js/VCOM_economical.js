var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">economical</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Someone who is <i>economical</i> avoids wasting things, like money or food. So if someone sees you wrapping up a bite of food that could be part of tomorrow's lunch, don't let him call you "cheap." Tell him you are <i>economical</i>.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>economical</i> often describes someone who is frugal with money, but the word can apply to those who avoid wasting resources of any kind. An <i>economical</i> speaker, for example, avoids wasting words and doesnâ€™t talk any more than is absolutely necessary. Someone who is <i>economical</i> with his time gets things done efficiently, just as an <i>economical</i> dishwasher uses the precise amount of water and electricity.</p></div>`;
