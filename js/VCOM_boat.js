If you buy a private island, you'll need a <i>boat</i> to get there.</p><p class="long">A lobster boat travels across ocean bays powered by a small motor, and a sail boat is moved by the wind hitting its sails at a particular angle. A much smaller type of boat is a gravy <i>boat</i>, a boat-shaped serving dish that holds a sauce. <i>Boat</i> is sometimes used as a verb, meaning "to go out in a <i>boat</i>." The Old English root is <i>bat</i>, "ship or vessel," from a Germanic source.</p></div></div>`;
