If you want to buy a European-made car in the U.S., the price will include <i>tariffs</i> the government adds to the price of imported vehicles.</p><p class="long">Usually a government imposes a <i>tariff</i> to encourage its own industries and to discourage buying cheaper imports from other countries. If a government wants to protect its own clothing industry, it may add a tariff to imported clothing, to make sure that the imported clothes aren't cheaper than the locally manufactured items. You can control exports, too, by imposing tariffs. As a verb, you can say "the government <i>tariffs</i> certain imports and exports."</p></div></div>`;
