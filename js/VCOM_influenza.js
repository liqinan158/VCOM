The original idea was a flowing in — of ethereal fluid from the heavens, thus affecting human destiny. We know now influenza is caused by viruses, not heavenly fluid. When you have an influenza, you're likely to vomit, have diarrhea, be exhausted, and feel terrible overall. One way to prevent influenza is by getting a flu shot.</p></div></div>`;
