Most of an iceberg is under water and can't be seen; that's how a sneaky iceberg managed to sink the <i>Titanic</i>.</p><p class="long">Icebergs exist in the coldest waters on the planet â€” the largest icebergs ever observed have been in Antarctica. An iceberg is blamed in the famous sinking of the Titanic in 1912, and the disaster inspired a new system for tracking and measuring icebergs. Another kind of <i>iceberg</i> is the lettuce, which is crisp and nearly as pale as an actual iceberg. The colloquial "tip of the <i>iceberg</i>" means the smallest hint of a much larger problem.</p></div>`;
