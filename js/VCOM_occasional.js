var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">occasional</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When something happens from time to time on an irregular basis, we say it is an <i>occasional</i> occurrence. For example, you might have an <i>occasional</i> lunch with a friend.  If your friend ever picked up the bill, maybe it would happen more often.</p><p class="long"><i>Occasional</i> is a few steps removed from the Latin <i>cadere</i>, "to fall." So you might think of something <i>occasional</i> as something that happens "to fall" just whenever it happens to fall.  Speaking of falling, Voltaire once wrote, "The best government is a benevolent tyranny tempered by an occasional assassination."  An occasional election might do in a pinch.</p></div>`;
