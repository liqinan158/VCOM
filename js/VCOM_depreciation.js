The <i>depreciation</i> of the U.S. dollar when compared to the Euro, for example, means that you'll pay more for things in Europe at the current exchange rate.</p><p class="long"><i>Depreciation</i> is from the Latin word <i>depretiare</i>, which means to lower in price, with the roots <i>de</i>, meaning "down," and <i>pretium</i>, meaning "price." If something goes down in value, then the amount of the decrease is called <i>depreciation</i>. If, for example, you buy a car for $10,000, but a year later it is only worth $8,000 due to wear and tear, then the depreciation on the car is $2,000.</p></div>`;
