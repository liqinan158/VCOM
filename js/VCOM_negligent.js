var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">negligent</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use <i>negligent</i> when you want to describe someone who just doesn't give a hoot. You can be <i>negligent</i> at work if you let the work pile up while you play computer games, or you can be <i>negligent</i> at home if you haven't fed your fish for six days straight.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>negligent</i> comes from the Latin word <i>neglegentia</i>, meaning "carelessness." Other words that share the same roots include the noun <i>negligence</i> and <i>neglect</i> — which has both noun and verb forms. All three words have meanings that imply the same sort of thing — a lack of attention to the well being of something or someone.</p></div>`;
