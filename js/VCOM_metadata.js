In other words, <i>metadata</i> is "data about data." No kidding.</p><p class="long">The classic example of metadata is a library's card catalog â€” it's a complete system of data that's all about another set of data, the books that library holds. Today you'll find that metadata is primarily digital, existing on web pages and in computer files. Metadata tells you things about the data it describes, often including what the data is for, when and where it was created, and who created it.</p></div></div>`;
