You see these a lot in documentaries. For example, there could be a <i>dramatization</i> of the JFK assassination, using actors to show what happened on that fateful day.</p><p class="long">If you watch a lot of true-crime shows, you probably regularly see dramatizations of dastardly deeds. <i>Dramatization</i> can also mean turning a novel into a movie or a play. Dramatization is a great way to cement learning. If you and your friends write a skit in biology class to show how photosynthesis works, you are much more likely to remember the process by which plants convert light into energy.</p></div></div>`;
