Ancient Egyptians would often <i>mummify</i> bodies by wrapping them in cloth. Don't try that at home!</p><p class="long">Many cultures have had a tradition of mummification — in other words, they would mummify their dead, often to insure a happy afterlife, by removing the internal organs, treating the body with minerals and oils, and wrapping it. Sometimes burial conditions, like a very dry location, have served to accidentally mummify a body. <i>Mummify</i> adds the verb-forming suffix <i>fy</i> to <i>mummy</i>, rooted in the Arabic <i>mumiyah</i>.</p></div></div>`;
