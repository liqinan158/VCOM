If you suddenly woke up in the year 3025, your <i>befuddlement</i> would be totally understandable.</p><p class="long">When someone is utterly bewildered or mixed-up, they're befuddled, and this extreme kind of confusion is befuddlement. If you notice a tourist's befuddlement, it would be friendly to offer directions. If you don't study at all for a math test, complete befuddlement when you see the exam may be inevitable. <i>Befuddlement</i> comes from a now-obsolete verb, <i>fuddle</i>, "to confuse as though with drink."</p></div>`;
