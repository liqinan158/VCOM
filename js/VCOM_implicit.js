You might think you and your boyfriend might have an <i>implicit</i> understanding that you are going to get married, but it's probably better to talk it through.</p><p class="long">A very near synonym of <i>implicit</i> in this particular meaning is the word <i>implied</i>. But the adjective <i>implicit</i>  also means "complete without any doubt," so we can say that we have <i>implicit</i> trust or confidence in someone. The Latin root <i>implicƒÅre</i> means "to involve or entangle." Another English word with a more obvious connection to the Latin is the verb <i>implicate</i>.</p></div>`;
