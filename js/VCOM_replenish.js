If you have a pet pooch, you’re probably obligated to <i>replenish</i> his food bowl to avoid being barked at incessantly.</p><p class="long">Use <i>replenish</i> when talking about something valuable or desirable, such as money or food. For example, you might discuss replenishing your bank account, but you wouldn’t speak of replenishing a trash can. You can also use <i>replenish</i> in a joking way to show that something is of value to you; by noting that the jar of jellybeans on your desk needs to be replenished, you indicate that you require jellybeans to survive your day at the office. We get that.</p></div>`;
