Note the prefix <i>sub</i>, meaning "underneath," with the remainder coming from the Latin <i>vertere</i>, "to turn." Think about a subversive as a sneaky kind of revolutionary who tries to turn the system from underneath. Art or literature is considered subversive if it attempts to undermine the dominant values and traditions of a society.</p></div>`;
