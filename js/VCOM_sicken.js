It might <i>sicken</i> you to realize that you've hit a squirrel with your car.</p><p class="long">When things sicken you, they either make you feel terrible — disgusted or horrified — or they make you physically sick. Eating a piece of moldy bread or some potato salad that's been sitting in the sun too long will probably sicken you. Reading a story about childhood hunger and poverty in the newspaper can also sicken you. The earliest meaning of <i>sicken</i> was "fall ill," from an Old English root, <i>seoc</i>, "ill, diseased, weak, or troubled."</p></div>`;
