When you poop or fart, you're using your anus.</p><p class="long">When you talk about your <i>anus</i>, you're using a formal, scientific word. Many kids and adults are more likely to use a slangy term like <i>butthole</i> or <i>bunghole</i> when discussing their anus, but if you're speaking to adults or writing a paper, <i>anus</i> is the word you want. The anus might seem like a funny part of the body, and maybe it is, but it's also incredibly important. Without an anus, you'd die.</p></div></div>`;
