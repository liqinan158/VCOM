Civil War soldiers with gangrene who had their limbs amputated suffered from <i>necrosis</i>.</p><p class="long">You're not likely to come across the noun <i>necrosis</i> unless you're in a hospital or a medical school pathology class. It's a term that describes the death of cells in a living organism, usually after an infection or severe illness. It's not something most people need to worry about, unless they are bit by a brown recluse spider. Its venom has been shown to kill live cells in humans â€” in other words, to cause necrosis.</p></div>`;
