The cyclone-level wind during such a storm can be described as <i>blustering</i> or <i>blustery</i>, both from a Germanic root meaning "blow violently." You can also describe people as blustering if they're talking with violent aggressiveness, or <i>bluster</i>: "The blustering bully scared the smaller kids."</p></div>`;
