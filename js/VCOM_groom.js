When you spend over an hour <i>grooming</i> in the bathroom, combing your mustache and buffing your nails, you drive everyone else who needs to use the bathroom crazy.</p><p class="long">You can groom something besides a person. Resorts groom their golf courses and ski runs. If you own a horse, you groom it every day. Animals groom each other by picking off insects and licking at fur. You can also use <i>groom</i> in regards to the mind. If you are being groomed for a certain spot or position, you are being prepared to take over its activities and responsibilities. Let's hope that you will someday be groomed for a spot on an executive board. And last but not least, the man getting married at a wedding is the groom.</p></div>`;
