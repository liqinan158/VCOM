When you go camping and hiking in the western United States, park rangers might teach you what to do if you see a <i>grizzly</i>.</p><p class="long">The <i>grizzly</i> bear's formal Latin name, <i>Ursus arctos horribilis</i>, came from confusion between <i>grizzly</i> and <i>grisly</i>, or "horrible." Grizzly bears are known for being solitary and having brown fur tipped in white or gray. The adjective <i>grizzly</i> probably arose from these "grizzled" or gray-colored hairs, since it describes appearing aged or old, especially because of graying hair.</p></div></div>`;
