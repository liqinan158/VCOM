Every animal that uses lungs for breathing also has a <i>windpipe</i>.</p><p class="long">The windpipe is made of cartilage, and it allows air to flow freely in and out of your lungs. If your windpipe becomes inflamed or irritated, you'll cough, and if it's blocked by a wayward chunk of food you may need someone to pound hard on your back or give you the Heimlich maneuver to remove it. The medical term for windpipe is <i>trachea</i>.</p></div></div>`;
