When you go to the doctor with a sore throat, a <i>clinician</i> will ask you to stick out your tongue and say "Ahh."</p><p class="long">The word <i>clinician</i> is often used simply to mean "doctor," but it applies to any health professional who works one-on-one with patients, diagnosing or treating illness. A clinician might be a physician or nurse, a psychologist, or a speech-language pathologist. Doctors whose work keeps them in laboratories or research facilities, rather than working with patients, are not considered clinicians. The Greek root is <i>klinike techne</i>, "practice at the sickbed."</p></div></div>`;
