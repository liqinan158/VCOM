Your teacher might ask you to give an answer in a single limpid sentence. But he probably won't because <i>limpid</i> is a word that's fallen out of use. Maybe because it sounds too much like <i>limp</i>. Or maybe because it's associated with the king of all clich√©s: "Her eyes were like limpid pools."</p></div></div>`;
