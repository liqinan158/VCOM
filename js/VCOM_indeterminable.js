Something that's indeterminable is none of these — it’s not able to be determined. Maybe you need more information or better math skills. The grade you would’ve gotten on a paper you didn’t write is indeterminable, but if you’re lucky your teacher will give you an extension. Then that shining “C” is all yours!</p></div>`;
