Nowadays, that meaning holds, with hardware stores traditionally specializing mainly in materials and tools for building and repairs. The military use of the word has also remained, referring to major weapons such as tanks and missiles. However, since 1947, the word <i>hardware</i> has also taken on an ironically softer meaning — that of the components of a computer system.</p></div>`;
