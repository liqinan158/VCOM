Typically, a <i>syncopated</i> beat puts the stress where it wouldn't usually be.</p><p class="long">When your ear is expecting a weak beat and instead hears a strong or stressed one, it's syncopated. This adjective can also describe rhythms that are uneven or that disturb the flow of music and take it in a different direction. As a verb, <i>syncopate</i> means to make music with this kind of rhythm and also to "shorten words by omitting syllables," from the Greek root <i>synkope</i>, "contraction of a word."</p></div></div>`;
