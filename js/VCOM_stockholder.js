When you buy stocks, it's like buying part of the company. The more shares you buy, the more invested you are in a company. The value of the stock goes up when the company does well and goes down when the company does poorly, so stockholders want the company to succeed. If you want to become a stockholder, start following the stock market.</p></div>`;
