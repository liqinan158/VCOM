A <i>predicament</i> is a difficult, confusing, and unpleasant situation.</p><p class="long">The Greek word that predicament originally descends from means "a state of being." Which makes sense considering the words that sound like predicate are all about states of being––<i>predict</i>, or say what's going to happen in the future, and <i>predicate</i> the second part of a sentence that's led by the verb. Think of <i>predicament</i> as an unpleasant state of being.</p></div></div>`;
