Your grandpa probably tells you about how he used to <i>trudge</i> six miles uphill through a foot of snow in the brutal cold every morning just to get to school.</p><p class="long"><i>Trudge</i> is also a noun that means a difficult, labored walk. If you take a mile-long trudge through heavy snow or mud, your steps will be slower and it will require more effort to put one foot in front of the other. Need help remembering what <i>trudge</i> means? Say it out loud. <i>Trudge</i> rhymes with <i>sludge</i> â€” and walking through sludge, or thick muck, would cause you to trudge.</p></div>`;
