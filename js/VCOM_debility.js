Very elderly people often need extra care because of <i>debility</i>.</p><p class="long">Debility is similar to disability, although the first term tends to describe a slower process of slowing and weakening, either physically or mentally. It comes from the Latin <i>debilitatem</i>, "a weakening," and its roots, the prefix <i>de-</i>, "from or away," and <i>-bilis</i>, "strength." A lack of proper nutrition over a long period can cause debility, and the very act of living to be 120 is sure to result in debility as well.</p></div>`;
