Most teachers have a rule that there's no <i>whispering</i> allowed while the class is taking a test.</p><p class="long">Whispering involves using your breath, rather than your vocal cords, to speak very quietly. You might hear whispering in the quiet section of the library or during a play or movie â€” it's used for communicating secrets or simply to avoid bothering other people. The word can also be used as an adjective for sounds that resemble a whisper, like the whispering wind through the trees on a breezy day.</p></div>`;
