A student of <i>ethnography</i> might live in Moscow to gather information about Russian marriage practices.</p><p class="long">First appearing in 1834, the noun <i>ethnography</i> combines the word <i>ethno</i>, meaning "race, culture," and <i>graph</i>, meaning "writing." If you study ethnography, you typically collect information through first-hand observation by participating in the society or culture you're studying. For example, as an ethnography student you might research the religious practices of an African tribe by living among the tribe members and taking part in their rituals and ceremonies.</p></div>`;
