Simple example: a cough is a <i>symptom</i> of a cold. We know we have a cold because we have the <i>symptom</i>, a cough.</p><p class="long">Don't confuse the <i>symptom</i> with the cause. Even when the symptom is worse than the cause, don't be tempted to confuse them. Fever, sneezing, achiness: all of these are <i>symptom</i> of a cold. But they are not the cold. They are <i>symptoms</i> of it. Relationship experts argue over whether "cheating” is the cause of unhappiness or the symptom. In other words, do people think about breaking up because of cheating, or do they cheat because they're thinking about breaking up.</p></div></div>`;
