Each of the monotheistic religions has a different idea about the way to achieve salvation. <i>Salvation</i> doesn't always have to do with theology; if a freak snowstorm on your camping trip has you worried about hypothermia, salvation can come in the form of an abandoned house with a working fireplace.</p></div></div>`;
