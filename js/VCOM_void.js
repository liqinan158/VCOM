In other words, nothing was there: pure emptiness. When you void something or make it void, you make it legally invalid, and that kind of <i>void</i> often goes with <i>null.</i> You might tell Cinderella, "If you're not back by midnight, that arrangement with the pumpkin and the mice is null and void."</p></div></div>`;
