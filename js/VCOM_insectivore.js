If chocolate-covered crickets are your thing, then go ahead and call yourself an <i>insectivore</i> (and good luck finding a date).</p><p class="long">A carnivore is an animal that eats other animals, and an insectivore is a more specific type of carnivore: one whose diet is mainly insects. Insectivores include many lizards, frogs, and spiders. A spider catching a bug in a web and a frog catching a fly with its tongue are two examples of insectivore behavior. Since there are millions of insects in the world, being an insectivore is a pretty good deal.</p></div></div>`;
