For example, your cousins might <i>implicate</i> you in the planning of a big party for your grandparents.</p><p class="long"><i>Implicate</i> comes from the Latin word <i>implicare</i>, meaning "to entwine, involve." When you implicate someone, you bring him or her into a group or to pitch in on a project. <i>Implicate</i> can have criminal connotations when it means "to connect in an incriminating manner," like when detectives figure out who drove the getaway car in the bank robbery â€” that person will be implicated for his or her role in the crime.</p></div>`;
