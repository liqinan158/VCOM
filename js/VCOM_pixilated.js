But instead of pixels, <i>pixilated</i> comes from <i>pixies</i>, the impish mythical spirits. Most experts believe that the word began as <i>pixie-led</i>, or "led astray by pixies." So if someone you know is acting as silly as if they're under the influence of pixies, you can call them <i>pixilated</i>.</p></div></div>`;
