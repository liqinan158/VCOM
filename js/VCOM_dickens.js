Instead of shocking your grandmother by cursing, you can instead say, "After shoveling all that snow, my back hurts like the <i>dickens</i>." This exclamation has been around since the late 1500's, when it became a substitute for <i>devil</i>, but no one's sure exactly why <i>dickens</i> was used. It may be from the last name <i>Dickens</i>, though it definitely pre-dates the writer Charles Dickens.</p></div>`;
