If you have the chance to go to a <i>ceilidh</i>, you'll love learning group dances, often performed in a ring formation, and you might even see traditional step dancing.</p><p class="long">The earliest ceilidhs were simple parties without any music or dancing, or even informal social visits. The word comes from the Old Irish <i>céle</i>, "companion," and literally means "visit" in Gaelic. Modern ceilidhs are much more festive than an ordinary visit, and can feature fiddlers, singers, flutes, accordions, and more. Ceilidhs are quite common in Scotland (and Ireland, where they're spelled <i>cèili</i>), and their popularity extends to the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.</p></div>`;
