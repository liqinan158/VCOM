Try not to get anything stuck in your <i>nostrils</i>; they're important passageways!</p><p class="long">Your nostrils are extremely important, since they provide a direct connection to your lungs — for air — and your olfactory nerves, which your body uses to smell things. You are almost certainly aware of your two external nostrils, but you may not know that you've got two more, inside your head at the very back of the nasal cavity. Most animals have <i>nostrils</i>, even fish — though they use theirs only for smelling, not for breathing. Fittingly, the Old English source of <i>nostril</i>, <i>nosðirl</i>, translates to "the hole of the nose."</p></div></div>`;
