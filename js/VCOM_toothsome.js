It's a word that seems to come up often in restaurant reviews: "The hamburger was overcooked, but the accompanying French fries were quite <i>toothsome</i>." This is the earliest meaning of <i>toothsome</i>, from the 1560's â€” later it came to also be used for describing a pretty girl.</p></div>`;
