An ambitious person will not be satisfied with modest progress. Around the turn of the 17th century, <i>modest</i> referred to proper or decent dress and behavior especially in women. Although this is considered dated today, <i>modest</i> is still used for people who are shy about showing their body. If you are modest, you might wear your t-shirt when you swim.</p></div>`;
