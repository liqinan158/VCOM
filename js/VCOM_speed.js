When something picks up too much <i>speed</i>, it can run off course, like a kid on a bike zooming uncontrollably down a steep hill.</p><p class="long"><i>Speed</i> can be a noun or verb. As a noun, it's an indicator of pace, as in the <i>speed</i> of a car. As a noun, it's also a drug that keeps you awake, very awake. As a verb, it means to “move along quickly,” like how you speed around on your bike. A fun fact: while <i>speed</i> refers to the distance traveled by an object during a specific amount of time, <i>velocity</i> describes that distance, but in a specified direction.</p></div></div>`;
