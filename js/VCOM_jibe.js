If someone directs that kind of jibe at you, the best response is a really good comeback. And in nautical terminology, <i>jibe</i> refers to a particular manner of changing the course of a ship. How did this word come to have such different meanings? Your guess is as good as ours. Just try to remember that if you want to jibe with others, don’t insult them.</p></div></div>`;
