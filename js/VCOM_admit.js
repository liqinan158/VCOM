It wasn't easy to <i>admit</i> that you'd broken the vase, but how else could you explain that your hand was glued to it?</p><p class="long">Besides meaning "confess," <i>admit</i> can also mean "let in," like a theater ticket that says "ADMIT ONE."  If you admit that you have a bag of popcorn hidden in your backpack, you might not be admitted to the movie. A doorway admits you into a room, and if a room can hold up to 50 people, that room admits 50. You can even use <i>admit</i> for metaphorical entrances, like the way your wild style admits you into high fashion circles.</p></div></div>`;
