In other words, it’s an oval.</p><p class="long">This is a word you'll probably see in geometry class, though it's a shape you can find all over the place. An <i>ellipse</i> is a closed curve that never made it around to a circle. If one thing travels around another in the shape of an ellipse — like the earth around the sun — it has an elliptical orbit. The plural for both <i>ellipse</i> and <i>ellipsis</i> is <i>ellipses</i> — so be careful not to mix up your ovals with your dots.</p></div>`;
