If you've ever donated blood, you know that having a needle put in your <i>vein</i> by a health care worker is not nearly as scary as it sounds.</p><p class="long">Although it mainly describes part of the body's circulatory system, <i>vein</i> can also refer to a pattern that looks like a vein in your body. For example, you can describe the streaks of color that run through blue cheese as veins of greenish-blue. Similarly, a theme or idea that continues appearing throughout a book could be called a <i>vein</i>. The trickiest thing about the word <i>vein</i> is trying not to confuse it with its homophones â€” <i>vane</i> (as in weather vane) and <i>vain</i> (as in conceited).</p></div></div>`;
