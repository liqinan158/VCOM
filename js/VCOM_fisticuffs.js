A heated argument can sometimes end in <i>fisticuffs</i>, with both participants punching wildly at each other.</p><p class="long">If someone says to you, "Let's take this outside and settle it with some <i>fisticuffs</i>," it means you're likely to end up in a street scuffle. This seventeenth century word isn't too common these days, but it's a colorful way to say "fistfight." The word's form may imitate <i>handiwork</i>, or it might be based on the now-obsolete adjective <i>fisty</i>, "related to the fists," combined with the verb <i>cuff</i>, or "hit."</p></div>`;
