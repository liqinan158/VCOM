A household <i>freezer</i> is usually built into a refrigerator.

Larger freezers are used to keep enough food for a long period of time, or so a restaurant, hotel, or school cafeteria can store leftover food or keep enough to cook for a crowd of people. The word <i>freezer</i> was coined in 1847, although it originally meant part of an ice cream maker.</p></div></div>`;
