If your dad yells, “Get that <i>contraption</i> out of here!” He doesn’t appreciate the Rube Goldberg machine you made out of his golf clubs.</p><p class="long">The word is English, all right, but how it got here is a mystery. It may be from a combination of <i>contrive</i> and <i>adaptation</i>. Contraptions — also called gadgets or gizmos — are devices people make for various purposes. Often, this word is used when someone isn't quite sure what something is, as in "What's that <i>contraption</i>?" Oh that’s just a dog-walking machine made of a roller skate, bacon, and four paper clips.</p></div></div>`;
