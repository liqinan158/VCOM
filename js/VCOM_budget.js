Like allotting certain amounts for food, rent, movies, and manicures every month to make sure you don't run out of cash.</p><p class="long">From the Middle French <i>bougette</i>, the noun <i>budget</i> translated to “leather pouch” when it was first used in the early 15th century. Perhaps a leather pouch to hold gold coins? It wasn’t until 1733 that the word took on the more specific financial meaning it has nowadays. You can budget all sorts of things, including time, money, and energy. Every year, Congress tries to balance the federal budget — but that's no easy task.</p></div>`;
