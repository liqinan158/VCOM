You might feel <i>bashful</i> when meeting a famous actress, a high-ranking government official, or just someone whom you find really good-looking.</p><p class="long"><i>Bashful</i> and <i>shy</i> are similar in meaning, but not quite identical. <i>Bashful</i> often describes people who are shy but friendly. In fact, being bashful is sometimes seen as an endearing quality. So, you probably wouldn't use <i>bashful</i> to describe a quiet, reserved coworker with whom you have little contact; <i>shy</i> would be a better fit. However, <i>bashful</i> is a perfect description for your good friend who unfortunately becomes tongue-tied whenever she tries to talk to strangers.</p></div></div>`;
