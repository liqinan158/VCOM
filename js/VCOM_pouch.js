Sit! Stay! Good boy.</p><p class="long">It used to be much more common for people to carry things around in pouches for safety and convenience â€” money pouches, mail pouches, tobacco pouches, and so on. Often these were drawstring bags that cinched securely at the top. The word came to be used for other things with a similar shape, including animal cavities meant for carrying babies (think a kangaroo's pouch) and various pocket-shaped receptacles.</p></div>`;
