You might quietly refer to your cranky math teacher as a <i>harpy</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>harpy</i> is a derogatory term for a very unpleasant female person. It is often considered offensive to call someone a harpy, in part because it singles out a nasty woman, when a man with similar characteristics might simply be "loud" or "opinionated" or "overbearing." The word comes from Greek mythology, in which a <i>harpy</i> was a food-stealing creature with a woman's head and the body of a bird.</p></div></div>`;
