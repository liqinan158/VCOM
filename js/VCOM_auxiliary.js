The <i>auxiliary</i> police will help out the regular police with things like directing traffic and crowd control when there's a special event in town.</p><p class="long">The Latin word <i>auxilium</i> means "help," and so <i>auxiliary</i> means something that "helps" by providing backup or support. Think of auxiliary verbs (sometimes called helper verbs), that provide support within a verb phrase, as "is" does in "Helen is playing." You can have an auxiliary engine in a car, an auxiliary cook at a restaurant, an auxiliary electrical network at a factory, or auxiliary troops standing by during battle. A "Ladies Auxiliary" functions as support for institutions such as churches, synagogues, or charities.</p></div></div>`;
