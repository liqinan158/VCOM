Your <i>vengefulness</i> toward that kid who taped a "kick me" sign on your back is totally understandable.</p><p class="long">Have you ever longed to get revenge on someone? Then you've experienced vengefulness, an urge to retaliate for bad or unfair treatment. Both <i>vengefulness</i> and <i>revenge</i> come from a verb we don't use anymore, <i>venge</i>, which meant "to take revenge or punish." History and literature are both brimming with stories of vengefulness, from <i>Hamlet</i> to Homer's <i>Iliad</i> to <i>The Princess Bride</i> â€” everyone's out for revenge.</p></div></div>`;
