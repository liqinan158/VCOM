You might ask a parson to preside at your wedding, or to officiate at your grandmother's funeral, for example. Experts are uncertain about the exact origins of <i>parson</i>, although one theory says it's a shortened form of the Latin <i>persona ecclesiae</i>, "person of the church."</p></div></div>`;
