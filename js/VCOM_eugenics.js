Since such a program would entail ranking human beings and the desirability of their genes, <i>eugenics</i> is widely considered unethical.</p><p class="long">The term <i>eugenics</i> was coined in 1883 by Francis Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin, and it comes from the Greek roots <i>eu-</i>, "good," and <i>genos</i>, "birth." Galton believed that the human race could be improved by encouraging people who have "good" genes to marry early and have lots of children, and discouraging people with "bad" genes from procreating at all. Nazi Germany provided a horrifying example of such a program at work, and eugenics is now seen as abhorrent.</p></div>`;
