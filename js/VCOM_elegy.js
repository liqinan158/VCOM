Although a speech at a funeral is a eulogy, you might later compose an <i>elegy</i> to someone you have loved and lost to the grave.</p><p class="long">The purpose of this kind of poem is to express feelings rather than tell a story. Thomas Gray's “Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard” is a poem that reflects on the lives of common people buried in a church cemetery, and on the nature of human mortality. The noun <i>elegy</i> was borrowed in the 16th century from Middle French <i>élégie</i>, from Latin <i>elegīa</i>, from Greek <i>elegeia</i>, from <i>elegos</i> "mournful poem or song."</p></div></div>`;
