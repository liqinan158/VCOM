Don’t cheat on your taxes, or an <i>auditor</i> might come and check your figures. An <i>auditor</i> is also an attentive listener. That kind is usually more fun.</p><p class="long">The word <i>auditor</i> is Latin for “hearer.” This word still applies to someone who listens closely, but it also refers to a kind of accountant who checks the financial records of other people, usually to make sure nothing illegal is going on. If the Internal Revenue Service demands an audit, an auditor will go over your financial records with a fine-toothed comb. This process used to be done verbally, so both kinds of auditors need good hearing.</p></div></div>`;
