Depending on who your parents are, your <i>filial</i> duties might include taking out the trash, washing dishes, or ruling empires.</p><p class="long">The word <i>filial</i> comes from the Latin words <i>filius</i>, which means "son," and <i>filia</i>, or "daughter." In other words, <i>filial</i> is the <i>filius</i> of <i>filius</i>. One way of remembering the word is to think of a filly, a young horse.  The two words aren't related, but it's fun to put them in the same sentence: "The filly's filial love made the mare a happy horse."</p></div>`;
