Tell an animal rights activist you use a badger's <i>bristle</i> shaving brush and you'll get the idea.</p><p class="long">The emotional meaning of to <i>bristle</i> comes from the fact that most animal bristles used by man are so-called erectile hairs — the ones that stand up on the neck or along the back of animal when it's angry or surprised. A common word associated with <i>bristle</i> is <i>hackle,</i> another name for such erectile animal hairs. Thus the saying "to get one's hackles up," which is pretty much identical to bristling.</p></div>`;
