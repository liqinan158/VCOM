You might wipe out on your bike and then <i>hobble</i> back home, pushing it in front of you.</p><p class="long">People who hobble, walking with a limp or a shuffle, have most often been injured in some way, though a disabled or elderly person might hobble too. You can call the walk itself a <i>hobble</i> as well: "I knew that football tackle hurt when I saw your hobble as you left the field." The root of <i>hobble</i> is Old English â€” it's related to the Dutch <i>hobbelen</i>, "rock from side to side."</p></div>`;
