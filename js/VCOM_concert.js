If you're in the glee club, you know about singing in <i>concerts</i>, and maybe you've seen your favorite bands in <i>concert</i>, too.</p><p class="long">A concert usually doesn't involve theatrical staging. You can have a concert version of an opera, but that means the singers stand there and sing without sets or props, and without much acting or moving around. Less commonly, <i>concert</i> is a verb (accent on the second syllable), meaning to agree with others on something. That meaning shows up in the phrase <i>in concert</i> â€” your objections will carry more weight if you act in concert with your neighbors.</p></div></div>`;
