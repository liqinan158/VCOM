Maybe you didn't hear the forecast that showers would <i>occur</i> this afternoon.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>occur</i> comes from the Latin, <i>occurrere</i>, “to meet” or “to present itself.” When something occurs, it comes into being, like a thought that seems to present itself from out of the blue, like when it suddenly occurs to you that you forgot to ask your guests if they'd like a cup of tea, or that it would never occur to your Mother that some people spend a small fortune on handbags.  Events can also occur, meaning "take place," like a meeting that will occur tomorrow.</p></div></div>`;
