When a cop hears of a crime that's happening in her <i>precinct</i>, she knows to hop in her car and head over there.</p><p class="long">The word <i>precinct</i> comes from the Latin <i>precinctum</i> meaning "enclosure, boundary line." A precinct is an area that has a clear boundary line around it, making it easier for the police to know where a crime is taking place, or where you should go to vote.  The word <i>precinct</i> has also come to mean police headquarters in a particular district. If you're being held at the precinct, you're at the police station local to where you committed your crime.</p></div></div>`;
