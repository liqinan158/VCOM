That bridge you just "bought" might be of <i>dubious</i> value.</p><p class="long"><i>Dubious</i> stems from Latin <i>dubiosus</i>, "doubtful" or "uncertain," and contains the Latin root <i>duo</i> in this case meaning "of two minds." This is apparent in that <i>dubious</i> generally describes something that appears one way but is truly another. A dubious claim is probably not true, whereas a dubious website or character is of questionable quality. <i>Dubious</i> can also be synonymous with <i>doubtful</i>, as in "she was dubious about the idea."</p></div>`;
