During World War II, the western Allies used <i>decryption</i> to decode secret messages between Germans that contained military strategy.</p><p class="long">While spies have used decryption for generations to decipher coded messages, it's only recently that most decryption occurs on computers. These days, almost all data is <i>encrypted</i>, concealed or protected by being converted to a code. Whether you enter a credit card number to buy something online or simply send an email, your information is encrypted to protect your privacy.
