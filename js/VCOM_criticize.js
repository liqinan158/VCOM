var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">criticize</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>criticize</i> is to find what's wrong with something, like the improbabilities in a movie's plot line, or double standards in your father's rules.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>criticize</i> comes from the noun, <i>critic</i>, and means "to act like a critic." A critic is someone who judges, and that doesn't have to mean negative judgment (think of a glowing movie review from a movie critic), but when we use <i>criticize</i> we always mean finding what's wrong, instead of what's good, with something. If your friend is just learning to bake, don't criticize his first batch of burned cookies too harshly; he'll just give up.</p></div>`;
