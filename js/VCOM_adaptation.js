Since then, the noun <i>adaptation</i> is often used to describe a change in behavior in response to new or modified surroundings, from learning to outrun a predator to wearing earplugs to block out your noisy neighbors. Or even changing that novel a bit to fit the demands of the big screen.</p></div>`;
