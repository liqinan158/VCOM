It's <i>disingenuous</i> when people pretend to know less about something than they really do.</p><p class="long"><i>Disingenuous</i> combines <i>dis-</i>, meaning "not," with <i>ingenuous</i> (from the Latin <i>gen-</i>, meaning "born") which was originally used to distinguish free-born Romans from slaves, and later came to mean honest or straightforward. So <i>disingenuous</i> means dishonest. <i>Ingenuous</i> is less common now than <i>disingenuous</i>, but we still use it for someone who is sincere to the point of naivet√©.  A good synonym is <i>insincere</i>.</p></div></div>`;
