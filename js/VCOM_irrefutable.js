If so, you probably needed to find evidence that could not be denied — that was absolutely true. That evidence would be considered <i>irrefutable</i>, impossible to disprove.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>irrefutable</i> comes from the Latin verb <i>refutāre</i>, "repel or beat," with the added negative prefix <i>in-</i>. Some things are simply irrefutable. These are things based in logic (if a=b and b=c, then a=c), or in fact (George Washington was the first president of the United States). But some things that are irrefutable, while maybe not logical, are simply not arguable, as when someone responds to "Why not?" with "Because I don't want to"!</p></div></div>`;
