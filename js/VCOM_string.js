You can tie on a Halloween mask with a <i>string</i>, or weave a friendship bracelet with a bunch of colorful <i>strings</i>.</p><p class="long">Strings are useful for tying up packages and cinching the waist of your sweatpants. You can also have a figurative string, a series or sequence: "Our team had a string of wins." As a verb, <i>string</i> means "attach together" or "thread onto a string." It can also mean "put strings on an instrument" â€” you might string your new ukulele, for example. And when you "string someone along," you mislead them on purpose over and over again.</p></div></div>`;
