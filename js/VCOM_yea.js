It's often paired with "nay" when taking a vote in formal government or law and sometimes when asking friends if they want to get together, "<i>Yea</i> or nay?"</p><p class="long">When an official asks for a vote on a bill or judgment, the question may be "How say you?" in the old style of English with an equally old-school response of "<i>Yea</i>" meaning a vote in favor. Using <i>yea</i> in casual conversation is less common but it's useful for showing that a person's "yes" counts as a vote because it matters in making a decision, as when you ask each other "Are you in or out â€” <i>yea</i> or nay?" when making plans.</p></div></div>`;
