If you're too scared to speak up when someone cuts in front of you as you wait in line for a movie, your date might call you a <i>nebbish</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Nebbish</i> is most often used to describe a man, especially one who is so mild and submissive that other people tend to feel sorry for him. A nebbish isn't capable of accomplishing much or defending himself, so he often finds himself scorned or pitied. <i>Nebbish</i> comes from a Yiddish word, <i>nebekh</i>, "poor thing," and it's been used in English slang since the late 19th century.</p></div></div>`;
