But in the case of <i>chart</i>, which comes from the French <i>charte</i> and Latin <i>charta</i>, "map," the meanings have grown a lot since the 1500s. Now, <i>chart</i> is a noun meaning any visual index of information, as in "that song is shooting up the <i>charts</i>." It's also still a map, as in "harbor <i>chart</i>." And it's a verb, as in "to <i>chart</i> your progress, make a <i>chart</i>."</p></div>`;
