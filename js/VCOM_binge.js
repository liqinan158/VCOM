If you give in to your urges and really indulge yourself, you <i>binge</i> on something, whether it's candy, video games, or shopping. There's an implied sense in the word <i>binge</i> that you're doing too much of something that isn't very good for you in the first place. <i>Binge</i> is also a verb, as in people who binge on television, watching show after show.</p></div></div>`;
