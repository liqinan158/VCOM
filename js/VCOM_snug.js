That could mean they’re just extra comfortable or it could be another way of saying they're feeling a little tight.</p><p class="long"><i>Snug</i> describes something that's comfortable and cozy. During a snowstorm you may take shelter in your snug cottage in front of the fireplace. When talking about clothing, <i>snug</i> means fitting tightly. Clothing may be snug on purpose, like a bathing suit, or it may be snug because it’s in fact too small. If you’re “snug as a bug in a rug,” you’re as cozy as can be, or metaphorically speaking, in a very comfortable position in life.</p></div>`;
