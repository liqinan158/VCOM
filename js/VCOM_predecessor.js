The person you replaced at work is your <i>predecessor</i>, just like Pac Man is the <i>predecessor</i> of modern video games.</p><p class="long">If you break the word <i>predecessor</i> down to its Latin roots, you get <i>pre</i>, meaning "beforehand," and <i>decessor</i>, which means "retiring officer." So that's how we get to our definition of "someone who has held an office or position before the present holder." But predecessors aren't just found in the business world: these days predecessors include our ancestors, earlier car models, and all kinds of other forerunners.</p></div>`;
