It's also a good word for something that's disappointing or undesirable: "No, that guy in the clown suit would be a completely <i>unsuitable</i> boyfriend for me." At the root of <i>unsuitable</i> is the meaning of <i>suit</i>, "be agreeable or convenient," that's thought to come from "provide a suit of clothes."</p></div></div>`;
