If you're considering buying a purple velvet couch, you can order a <i>swatch</i> to see if it's really going to match your living room rug.</p><p class="long">A swatch is useful because it gives you an idea of what something larger—like curtains, a dress, or an upholstered piece of furniture—will look like. Sometimes <i>swatch</i> is also used for samples of other things, like paint colors or makeup. <i>Swatch</i> comes from 16th-century Scots, in which it was used to mean "a tally fixed to a piece of cloth before dyeing."</p></div>`;
