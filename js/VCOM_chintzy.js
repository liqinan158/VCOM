A badly made pair of pants is <i>chintzy</i>, and a terribly acted, melodramatic movie is too.</p><p class="long">Things made of inferior materials are chintzy: "I like the neighborhood, but the house is so badly built, with really <i>chintzy</i> kitchen cabinets and closet doors." Another way to use this adjective is to mean "stingy," or "ungenerous." You might complain about your chintzy boss at work, who's known for giving workers five cent raises and not paying for overtime. <i>Chintzy</i> comes from the cotton fabric known as <i>chintz</i>, from the ordinariness of this common material.</p></div>`;
