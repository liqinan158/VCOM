Dorothy from <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> found out first-hand the meaning of <i>vortex</i> as she and her house whirled around in the funnel cloud of a tornado. In a figurative sense, <i>vortex</i> can be used to tell about something that seems like it is  whirling out of control, all consuming, or chaotic. This may include exam week, your relationships, or your life in general.</p></div>`;
