The portion you each receive is your share, also called your <i>allotment</i>.  No fighting over the coconuts!</p><p class="long">The word <i>allotment</i> shows how languages intertwined through the ages. We can see the word's origins in several languages, including the Old English <i>hlot</i>, the Gothic <i>hlauts</i>, the Old High German <i>hloz</i>, and the Old French <i>aloter</i>. All referred to dividing something into groups, or “lots.” A "lot" refers to a group of things — stores refer to shipments of goods as being divided into “lots.” That idea of grouping will help you remember the meaning of <i>allotment</i>.</p></div>`;
