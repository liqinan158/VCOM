Another kind of creepy feeling is something that gives you an unpleasant chill, like a creepy ghost story or the creepy sound of footsteps in your attic at night. The earliest meaning of <i>creepy</i> was simply "characterized by creeping," so in the 18th century you'd be creepy if you were simply tip-toeing quietly through your house.</p></div></div>`;
