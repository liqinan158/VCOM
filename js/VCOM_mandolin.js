Its sound is higher than a guitar, and it's often played alongside lower-pitched instruments, such as banjos and guitars. The mandolin is popular around the world and in many different kinds of music; in the United States, it's played most often in country music. The word itself comes from the Italian <i>mandolino</i>, which is an altered form of the Latin <i>pandura</i>, or "three-stringed lute."</p></div></div>`;
