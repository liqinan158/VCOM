In the 19th century, the most popular way to take short trips was in a horse and <i>buggy</i>.</p><p class="long">Most people think of a horse pulling a carriage when they hear the word <i>buggy</i>, although you can use the term for other small vehicles, whether they're electric or powered by gasoline â€” like a golf buggy. If you use <i>buggy</i> to describe a camp site, however, you mean it's infested with insects. The origins of both meanings are uncertain, although the Middle English <i>bugge</i>, "something frightening" might be one root of the "full of bugs" definition.</p></div>`;
