A spider web is <i>reticular</i>.</p><p class="long">Nets are interwoven with holes: they're used to catch fish and other things. Anything that resembles a net — or a network — can be called reticular. Many hammocks are reticular, and so is the knitting of many quilts and blankets. This word is often used in biology for parts of organisms that are net-like. Parts of our nervous system are often described as reticular, because the nerves resemble a net and also form a network.</p></div></div>`;
