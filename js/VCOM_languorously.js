While your friends spend their weekend shopping at the mall, you prefer to spend yours lounging <i>languorously</i> in a hammock with a book.</p><p class="long">Being a little sleepy or dazed, or feeling slightly lazy and self-indulgent, can lead you to act languorously. You might float languorously on your inflatable unicorn raft in a swimming pool, or sprawl languorously on the couch to watch TV on a rainy afternoon. This word comes from <i>languorous</i>, which originally meant "mournful," from the Latin root <i>languere</i>, "be weak or faint."</p></div></div>`;
