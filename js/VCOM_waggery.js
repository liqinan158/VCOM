Your extremely formal, old-fashioned teacher might bring the class's outbreak of giggles to an end by shouting, "Enough of that <i>waggery</i>!"</p><p class="long">Not too many people use the word <i>waggery</i> these days, but it's the perfect way to describe someone's jocular, playful — but slightly wicked — remarks or behavior. You can tell your impish little sister you're tired of her waggery or accuse your practical-joking uncle of waggery. The word, along with the adjective <i>waggish</i>, comes from <i>wag</i>, or "jokester."</p></div>`;
