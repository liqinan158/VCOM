A <i>vowel</i> is a letter that represents an open sound. There are six <i>vowels</i> in the English language: <i>a</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>o</i>, u and sometimes <i>y</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Y</i> is sometimes a vowel, as in the word <i>story</i> although it also sometimes acts as a consonant, as in the word <i>yes</i>. The vocal sounds represented by vowels are open and without friction. The word <i>vowel</i> comes from the Old French <i>voieul</i>, which is based on the Latin phrase <i>littera vocalis</i>, or "vocal letter," from the root word <i>vox</i>, or "voice."</p></div>`;
