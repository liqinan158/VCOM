Stepping off an airplane halfway around the world in the middle of the night will <i>disorient</i> even the most experienced traveler.</p><p class="long"><i>Disorient</i> comes from the French <i>d√©sorienter</i>, which means "to lose one's bearings" but literally translates to "to turn from the east." The Latin root is <i>orientem</i>, "the part of the sky where the sun rises." When we <i>orient</i> ourselves, we get our bearings, figuring out which direction we're facing. It disorients you to lose track of where you are, or to feel befuddled or confused: "That medicine always disorients my cat, making him stumble around bumping into things"</p></div></div>`;
