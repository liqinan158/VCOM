You're also a <i>dishwasher</i> if you volunteer to wash the dishes after dinner at home.</p><p class="long">Some dishwashers scrub pots, pans, and dishes by hand, while others simply load up the other kind of <i>dishwasher</i> â€” a machine that automatically cleans dishes. While a human dishwasher has to scrub to get the dishes clean, a mechanical dishwasher sprays extremely hot water to do the same job. This new and improved type of dishwasher was invented in the late 19th century.</p></div>`;
