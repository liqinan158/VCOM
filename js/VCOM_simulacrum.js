A wax museum is full of <i>simulacrums</i> of famous people.</p><p class="long"><i>Simulacrum</i> comes from the Latin word <i>simulare</i> meaning "to make like" and is related to words like <i>simulate</i> (to imitate) and <i>similarity</i>. A simulacrum might look like a person, but it's usually a sculpture. Also, a simulacrum can be a representation that's not very good. If you say, "This video game is only a <i>simulacrum</i> of playing football!" that means it does a poor job of copying the game.</p></div>`;
