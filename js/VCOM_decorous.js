Both words come from the Latin word <i>decor</i>, meaning "beauty, elegance, charm, grace, ornament." So, something decorous is attractive. <i>Decorous</i> can also mean "dignified or proper," like your decorous habit of saying, "How do you do?" when you meet someone for the first time.</p></div>`;
