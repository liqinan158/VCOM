Men can be <i>suave</i> and debonair, especially the ones riding horses on the covers of romance novels.</p><p class="long"><i>Suave</i> is from the Latin word <i>suavis</i> which means  "agreeable." To be <i>suave</i> is still to be agreeable — a <i>suave</i> person knows how to work the room, and you might want to appear <i>suave</i> and sophisticated when you meet your sweetie's parents. Although it's an old fashioned compliment, <i>suave</i> has morphed into something meaning a little bit cheesy. <i>Suave</i> men know how to talk to the ladies — mustaches, cologne, and ridiculous come-ons could be involved.</p></div></div>`;
