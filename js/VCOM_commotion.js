It can be a disorderly outburst or disruption, like someone yelling in the street at night, or five people arguing about someone talking on a cellphone while a play is being performed in front of them. <i>Commotion</i> can also describe out-of-control movement, like people pushing and shoving to get to the front row of a concert.</p></div>`;
