It's another thing altogether to be <i>legendary</i>, or like a legend. The Monkees were a famous band. The Beatles are <i>legendary</i>—for most people, they are almost mythical in their greatness.</p><p class="long">There are a couple of ways to become <i>legendary</i>, but, however you get there, you have to become a legend. The first way is to be better at something than anyone else ever was. Michael Jordan, for example, is a legendary basketball player. The other way is to be known—and yet remain mysterious—for a very long time. The legendary Loch Ness Monster, for example, is very well known for a creature that (almost?) no one has ever actually seen.</p></div>`;
