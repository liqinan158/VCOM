If you walk heavily, people will say you tramp, but if you're going on a tramp, that means you're going for a long walk or hike. If someone calls you a tramp, they either mean you're a slut or a hobo â€” each meaning comes vagrant, or wanderer, and the low-life behaviors associated with vagrants.</p></div></div>`;
