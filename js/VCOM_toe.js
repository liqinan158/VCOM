The way those toes are used distinguishes these animals from each other. Some, like dogs, are <i>digitigrade</i>, walking on their toes. Humans are <i>plantigrade</i>, meaning we walk with our toes flat against the ground, our weight on the soles of our feet. You can also use <i>toe</i> to mean the front of your shoe, or as a verb meaning "to touch with one's foot."</p></div></div>`;
