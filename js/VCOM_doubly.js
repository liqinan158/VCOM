If your new French class is <i>doubly</i> hard as last year's class, it's two times harder.</p><p class="long">Sometimes people use <i>doubly</i> for general emphasis, to mean "very" or "especially." Your boss might say, "Today's <i>doubly</i> important because the owner of the company will be observing our work." Or you might feel doubly hungry for breakfast after a morning swim. <i>Doubly</i> comes from the adjective <i>double</i>, with its Latin root of <i>duplus</i>, "twofold or twice as much," from <i>duo</i>, "two."</p></div>`;
