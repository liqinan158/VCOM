In the digital age, an address has also come to mean the location where you might e-mail your friend pictures of your dog dressed up in a birthday hat. If you wanted to tell that friend about your dog's birthday party in person, you might address her directly. <i>Address</i> to describe a way of speaking is usually reserved for more formal occasions, such as when the President addresses the nation.</p></div>`;
