You might superciliously ask your taxi driver if he's unfamiliar with the city, or glance superciliously at a couple of giggling teenagers in line at the movies. The word comes from its related adjective, <i>supercilious</i>, which has a Latin root, <i>supercilium</i>, used to mean "haughty demeanor or pride," but literally meaning "eyebrow," as when a supercilious person raises one haughty eyebrow.</p></div></div>`;
