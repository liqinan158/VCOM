You can describe the sky at night as a <i>firmament</i> shining with stars (if you're feeling poetic).</p><p class="long">The word <i>firmament</i> comes from the Latin <i>firmus</i>, or "firm," and this description of the sky as something solid reflects ancient ideas of the way the universe was constructed. The first stargazers imagined the sky as a sphere, and it wasn't until the late 1500s that the idea of an infinite universe was seriously considered. Today the word <i>firmament</i> is mostly literary, used to poetically describe the visual curve of the sky.</p></div>`;
