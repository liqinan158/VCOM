Many governments claim to guarantee <i>freedom</i>, but often people do not, in fact, have the absolute <i>freedom</i> to act or speak without restraint.</p><p class="long">People in jail long for freedom. People living under an oppressive government also long for freedom. In the United States, people theoretically have "<i>freedom</i> of speech": the right to say whatever they’re moved to say. You’ll notice the word <i>free</i> in <i>freedom</i>. <i>Free</i> comes from the German <i>frei</i>, meaning, “to love.” The word <i>friend</i> shares this origin. You can think of <i>freedom</i> as the condition in which you have the choice to love any friend you wish.</p></div>`;
