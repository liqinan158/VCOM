However, it has another meaning similar to other reduplicative such as jibber-jabber and mumbo-jumbo: nonsense. Someone spouting a bunch of weird talk that doesn't make any sense is speaking abracadabra. If you want to dismiss something written or spoken, you could say, "That's a bunch of <i>abracadabra</i>!" Like a baby's babbling, abracadabra is meaningless.</p></div>`;
