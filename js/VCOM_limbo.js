In common speech <i>limbo</i> can be used in much the same way as “gray area.” It’s a place where nothing is clear or certain. When the law isn’t clear on a specific issue, then that issue is in “legal <i>limbo</i>.” If there is an election that is so close that no one knows who won, that’s “political <i>limbo</i>.”</p></div>`;
