If you had <i>qualms</i> about taking candy from the bulk bins at the store, your conscience probably told you to go back to the cashier and pay.</p><p class="long"><i>Qualm</i> entered English in the 16th century, with meanings like "doubt" and "uneasiness." Usually a qualm comes from doubt about an action and a feeling that you are doing, or are about to do, something wrong. It isnâ€™t a bad feeling about another person's behavior but about your own. If you have qualms about lying to get into the over-18 dance club, you might decide to follow your gut-check and meet your friends for coffee instead.</p></div>`;
