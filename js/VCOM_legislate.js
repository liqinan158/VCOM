If you thought there should be a law that all money should be pink instead of green, you might write to your congresswoman with a suggestion to <i>legislate</i> your idea.</p><p class="long">Formal government bodies legislate. So, while you might create a rule at home to ban phone calls at dinner, the House of Representatives would legislate communication regulations during meals. <i>Legislate</i> may seem like a tricky word, but you can easily remember the meaning if you notice that the word begins with the same <i>leg</i> as the word <i>legal</i> does; both words relate to the law.</p></div></div>`;
