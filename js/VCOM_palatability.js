It usually has to do with the way things taste, and it comes from the word <i>palate</i>, which in turn is rooted in the Latin <i>palatum</i>, or "roof of the mouth." <i>Palatability</i> has evolved to include other qualities in addition to taste: "I question the <i>palatability</i> of a new tax â€” will it be acceptable to the voters?"</p></div>`;
