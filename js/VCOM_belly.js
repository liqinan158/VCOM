The word <i>belly</i> is a more casual way to say "stomach" or "abdomen," just as your navel is informally called a "<i>belly</i> button." A less common way to use the word is as a verb meaning "to swell," which is actually the oldest meaning of <i>belly</i>, from the Old English <i>belig</i>, "bag," and a Germanic root meaning "to swell like a bag."</p></div></div>`;
