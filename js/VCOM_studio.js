If you make pottery, you might dream of one day having a <i>studio</i> in your back yard.</p><p class="long">A studio is an artist's dedicated space for making art, whether they're a painter, photographer, or even a writer. Films are made in another type of studio, a facility for producing movies (and <i>studio</i> is also frequently used to mean the business entity that produces a movie).
