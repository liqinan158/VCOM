You probably find petting your cat <i>pleasurable</i>, but your cat may feel that scratching the sofa is much more <i>pleasurable</i> for him.</p><p class="long">Things that give you pleasure — because they're entertaining, funny, pleasant, or delicious — are pleasurable. Pleasure — just like beauty — tends to be in the eye of the beholder. Your idea of a pleasurable summer day might be lounging in a hammock with a good book and a glass of iced tea. And, while your sister thinks spending Saturday at the mall is pleasurable, that might sound like the least pleasurable activity in the world to you. The Latin root, <i>placere</i>, means "to please."</p></div></div>`;
