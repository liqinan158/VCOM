It was common to describe a mixed race person as a <i>mulatto</i> during the period of slavery in the United States.</p><p class="long">If you use the word <i>mulatto</i> to describe someone of mixed race, most people will know what you mean, but they may also be offended. People of mixed race are much more likely to describe themselves as <i>biracial</i> than <i>mulatto</i> these days. The Spanish root word, <i>mulato</i>, is used to mean "of mixed breed," although it literally means "young mule," from <i>mulo</i>, or "mule."</p></div>`;
