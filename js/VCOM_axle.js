The front wheels of your car sit on an <i>axle</i>, turning around it as the car moves.</p><p class="long">Any kind of vehicle with wheels uses some kind of axle for those wheels to rotate on. Trucks, buses, and cars have axles, and so do lawnmowers and wagons and even bicycles. The original, Middle English word for <i>axle</i> was <i>axle-tree</i>, which came from a combination of the Old Norse word <i>Ã¶xull</i> and the Old English <i>eax</i>, both of which mean "axis," or "line around which a body rotates."</p></div>`;
