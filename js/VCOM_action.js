Legal action is the initiation of a lawsuit to demand your rights. In war, a soldier working in the kitchen is on cooking duty, while the soldier on the frontline sees a lot of action. Action movies are so called because they are full of fast-paced sequences. If you are sitting on your couch, mulling over your lack of exercise, maybe it's time to take action.</p></div>`;
