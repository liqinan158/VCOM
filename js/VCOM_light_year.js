Informally, astronomers use the <i>light year</i> to describe distances between planets, stars, moons and other astronomical bodies.</p><p class="long">Light years are sometimes mistakenly thought of as units of time — because of the <i>year</i> — but they're actually units of distance, equal to about six trillion miles. In 1851, the light year was first used for defining distances by a German astronomer who compared it to a "hiking hour," or the distance a person can hike in one hour. The term can also figuratively mean "a long way:" "Our team is <i>light years</i> ahead of where they were last summer!"</p></div></div>`;
