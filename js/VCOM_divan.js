Famously, Sigmund Freud's patients reclined on a <i>divan</i> during psychoanalysis.</p><p class="long">The word <i>divan</i> comes from Turkish, and its meaning, "long, cushioned seat," evolved from "book of accounts" to "council chamber" and finally to a type of seating that's common in council chambers in the Middle East. Occasionally people mean a bed with box-springs when they talk about a divan, but it usually refers to a seat with cushions for leaning against.</p></div></div>`;
