If so, you might call yourself a <i>homebody</i>, someone who favors being in the place where they live.</p><p class="long">Use the informal <i>homebody</i> for anyone who typically opts for staying home instead of going out. We often think of homebodies as being unadventurous ("Want to come with me to Morocco?" "No thanks, I'm a bit of a homebody!"), and while most of us are comfortable at home, a homebody feels especially safe, content, and happy there. The first recorded use of this North American word was in 1821.</p></div>`;
