When revocation happens, a privilege, title, or status is removed from someone. If the library revokes your library card, you can no longer take out library books â€” that's a type of revocation. If a restaurant is dirty, that could result in the revocation of its health license. If a lawyer breaks the law, it could lead to the revocation of his license to practice law.</p></div>`;
