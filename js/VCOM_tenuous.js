Something can be physically tenuous, like a spiderweb or ice on a pond. We more often use it in a metaphorical sense, to talk about weak ideas. Tenuous arguments won't win any debate tournaments. Synonyms for <i>tenuous</i>, also used physically or metaphorically, are <i>flimsy</i> and <i>shaky</i>.</p></div></div>`;
