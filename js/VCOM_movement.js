If you're watching a play, you might notice that an actor's repeated <i>movement</i> from one side of the stage to the other shows her character's nervousness.</p><p class="long">A campaign to create some change or achieve a goal is another kind of <i>movement</i>, like the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s. A major section of a musical piece is also called a <i>movement</i>. Each movement of a symphony can have a different tempo and feel, working to build the piece toward a dramatic finish. Beethoven's Fifth Symphony has four movements.</p></div>`;
