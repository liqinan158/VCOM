In either case, you're highly doubtful. You can even describe a person as questionable, if he or she doesn't strike you as completely honest. The original meaning of the word was "that may be interrogated," from the Latin root word <i>quaestionem</i>, "a seeking, inquiry, questioning, or examination."</p></div>`;
