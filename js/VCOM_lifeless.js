Your <i>lifeless</i> house plant probably got that way because you forgot to water it.</p><p class="long">You can use the adjective <i>lifeless</i> to describe once-living things, like people, animals, and plants, and you can also use it for objects that appear inert: "The creepy thing about that painting is the clown's <i>lifeless</i> eyes." Things that are duller or droopier than they should be are also lifeless, like your lifeless hair or a writer's lifeless prose. Less common is using <i>lifeless</i> to mean "with no living things," like the lifeless planet Venus.</p></div></div>`;
