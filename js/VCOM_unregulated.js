var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">unregulated</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Whether it’s an economy, the fishing industry, or your cash flow, something that’s <i>unregulated</i> knows no bounds — there are no rules or restrictions in place.</p><p class="long">When you break the word <i>unregulated</i> down, it’s easy to figure out what it means. The prefix <i>un-</i> reverses an action, so here it means “not.” Then you have <i>regulated</i>, which describes something that has rules or people who check that things are working properly. So if something is unregulated, there are no rules or people making sure everything is right, like an unregulated restaurant that the board of health doesn't know about.</p></div>`;
