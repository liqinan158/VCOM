If you have the chance, you should definitely try some <i>tamales</i>.</p><p class="long">Traditionally, the cornhusk (or banana leaf) wrapper was used as a plate for eating the warm tamale, and these delicious savory treats are often still eaten this way today. The starchy masa (or cornmeal) that's used in tamales becomes firm after being steamed, and this makes it a perfect portable meal. The word <i>tamale</i> comes from the Mexican Spanish <i>tamal</i>, which has a Nahuatl root, <i>tamalli</i>, meaning "wrapped."</p></div></div>`;
