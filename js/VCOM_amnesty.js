The government will essentially forget about whatever crime was committed, or whatever horrible things were said. As part of a truce, amnesty can be granted to opposition forces in civil disputes. <i>Amnesty</i> to illegal aliens means the government will deliberately overlook their illegal entry to the country. There can also be a period of <i>amnesty</i> when people can turn in something that they would otherwise get in trouble for. "The city offered a period of <i>amnesty</i> for everyone to turn in illegal guns."</p></div></div>`;
