His smile was as engaging as ever, but from his <i>sallow</i> complexion, I knew he was sick.</p><p class="long">Usually we say that when someone is sick they turn "green." You could also say their skin takes on a <i>sallow</i> look, and you'd mean the same thing. <i>Sallow</i> also describes the way someone looks if they have lost blood or are pale from fever. This word comes from Germanic roots meaning "dusky" or "dirty."</p></div></div>`;
