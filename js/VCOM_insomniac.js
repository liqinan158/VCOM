If you're an insomniac, though, it's not that you don't need sleep â€” it's that you can't get any at all. Break down the Latin root word and you get <i>in-</i> and <i>somnus:</i> "not sleep." "Not sleep!" is how you might start talking after several agonizing days of sleeplessness and walking into walls and assigning a name to every sheep that jumps the fence.</p></div></div>`;
