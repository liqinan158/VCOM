If the voters reelect her, she'll be president for four more years. Whenever citizens vote to choose an incumbent (a current political office holder), they reelect that person to continue doing his or her job. <i>Reelect</i> comes from the "again" or "back" prefix <i>re-</i> and <i>elect</i>, from the Latin root <i>eligere</i>, "to pick out or choose."</p></div></div>`;
