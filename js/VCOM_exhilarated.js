When you're <i>exhilarated</i>, you're in an extremely good mood. A good run on a sunny day full of kittens and rainbows can make you feel <i>exhilarated</i>.</p><p class="long">When you feel enthusiastic joy, you're exhilarated. This is an energetic, positive state. Landing the perfect job can make you feel exhilarated. Falling in love makes people feel exhilarated. Winning a spelling bee can make you feel exhilarated. When you're exhilarated, you're not only happy but bursting with energy. If you see a horse, you might feel happy. If you see a unicorn, you might be exhilarated!
