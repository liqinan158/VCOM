Suggest meeting at the local <i>saloon</i> after work and your friends might give you a funny look, but they'll know what you mean.</p><p class="long">A saloon is a place to sit drink a beer, though it's much more common these days to call it a bar or a pub. In the Old West, saloons played a huge role, providing refreshment to prospectors, trappers, and cowboys. The word comes from the French <i>salon</i>, and it originally had the same meaning, "living room." Later, <i>saloon</i> meant "hall," especially one on a boat or a train. In 1800's America, it came to mean "public house or bar."</p></div>`;
