That's the time limit for learning this word in a timely fashion. But the word <i>timely</i> isn't always about speed â€” being timely can also mean being well-timed or doing something at the most appropriate moment. If you're going for a job interview, it's important to make a timely arrival. And if you bump into friends just when they were wondering how you were doing, then you've made a timely appearance.</p></div></div>`;
