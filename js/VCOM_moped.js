You might find it easier to get around the city on your <i>moped</i> than in a car.</p><p class="long">Although today there are some mopeds that don't have them, the earliest versions always included bicycle pedals. The word itself was coined in 1952 by a Swedish journalist, from <i>trampcykel med motor och pedaler</i>, literally "pedal cycle with motor and pedals." It's relatively easy to get a license to ride a moped, which is less powerful and slower than a motorcycle.</p></div>`;
