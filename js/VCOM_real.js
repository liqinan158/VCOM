If you inherit some jewelry, you'll have to take it to an expert to know if those diamonds are <i>real</i> or just cubic zirconia, which looks like a diamond but isn't worth nearly as much.</p><p class="long">That seven footed monster your big brother used to tell you frightening stories about isn't real, and neither, sorry to say, is Santa Claus, because to be real, something has to actually exist. <i>Real</i> has roots in the Latin word <i>res</i>, meaning "thing." We also use <i>real</i> to mean "significant," like when we say something is a real problem, or when we say we're really, truly sorry about something. In old Spain or Brazil, a real is a coin.</p></div></div>`;
