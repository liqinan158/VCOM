If you run into a raccoon foaming at the mouth, don't pet him; he may have <i>rabies</i>.</p><p class="long">Most dog and cat owners are familiar with rabies, because it's an illness they regularly have their pets vaccinated against. An unvaccinated pet that's bit by an animal with rabies almost always dies â€” and this is also true for humans who contract rabies and aren't treated. In Latin, <i>rabies</i> means "madness," and this accurately describes some of the symptoms of this terrible disease.</p></div>`;
