As a great surfer, you remain <i>undaunted</i> as you seek out dangerous waters to ride the biggest waves.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>undaunted</i> was first used in the mid-15th century to describe horses that were "untamed, not broken in." These horses must have seemed wildly fearless and intrepid even in the most difficult situations. Similarly, an <i>undaunted</i> person remains courageous and bold when facing fear, difficulty, and danger. Paramedics and firemen are undaunted when faced with a burning building. You must remain undaunted when facing your terrifying calculus homework.</p></div></div>`;
