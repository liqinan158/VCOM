When you're sick, you feel lousy, and when someone is mean or rude, they treat you in a lousy way. The original, literal meaning of <i>lousy</i> is "infested with lice," those creepy crawly parasites that hang out on people's scalps. It was once common to say a place was "<i>lousy</i> with" something (like tourists or poodles) to mean "swarming with" them.</p></div></div>`;
