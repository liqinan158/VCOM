Each time you use a debit card, it deducts the amount you spend from your bank account. A different way to deduct is to come to a reasoned, thoughtful conclusion, or to <i>deduce</i>. The two words were once interchangeable, while now it's more common to use <i>deduct</i> to mean "remove a portion," and <i>deduce</i> to mean "infer logically."</p></div>`;
