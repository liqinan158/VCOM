If you're also a baseball fan, you may admire <i>southpaws</i> like the famous left-handed pitcher Sandy Koufax.</p><p class="long">The slightly old-fashioned term <i>southpaw</i> may have started in the 1880s as baseball slang for left-handed pitchers. Legend has it that a Chicago sports writer coined the term, based on the now-obsolete tradition of laying out baseball diamonds with home plate toward the west. Others attribute <i>southpaw</i> to boxing slang, for "left-handed punch." Whatever the origin, it's a colorful way to describe any lefty.</p></div>`;
