It includes the mountains, hills, creeks, and other bumps and lumps on a particular hunk of earth.</p><p class="long">This handy word is a Greek-rooted combo of <i>topos</i> meaning "place" and <i>graphein</i> "to write." The suffix <i>-graphy</i> means writing or representation made in a specific way, and shows up in familiar words like <i>photography</i>, <i>oceanography</i>, or even <i>geography</i>, which is similar to <i>topography</i>, but refers to where things are, but not what's on top. <i>Topography</i> represents a particular area in detail, including everything natural and man-made â€” hills, valleys, roads, or lakes. It's the geographical contours of the land.</p></div></div>`;
