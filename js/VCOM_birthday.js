It’s the yearly anniversary that marks the day you were born. Not everyone celebrates, but a <i>birthday</i> is a good excuse for a party and cake.</p><p class="long">You can use <i>birthday</i> both to refer to the specific day of a baby's birth, and the annual marking of that day throughout the years that follow. Sometimes people talk about the birthday of a country, group, or even a building: "It's the art museum's fiftieth birthday next year." The Old English <i>byrddæg</i> originally referred to the celebration of a king or saint's birth, but over the years it was extended to include everyone.</p></div></div>`;
