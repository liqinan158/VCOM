Those are anthologies.</p><p class="long">An <i>anthology</i> used to be just a collection of poetry, and the word came from the 17th-century Greek word <i>anthologia</i> for "flower gathering" or "collecting." A contemporary anthology can include anything from classic literature to rap music lyrics. Often an anthology focuses on one type, or genre, of writing, as in an anthology of horse riding haikus, or even an anthology of writings on writing. However, sometimes textbook-style anthologies — like <i>Global Literature</i> — will ambitiously try to include works from writers throughout the ages <i>and</i> from throughout the world.</p></div>`;
