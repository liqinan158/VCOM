If you wear tweed blazers and tiny round glasses, someone might say you have a <i>professorial</i> clothing style.</p><p class="long">A professorial sabbatical is a fancy name for a year that a professor takes off work to travel, do research, or write a book. And a professorial position might be "instructor" or "assistant professor." Many people also think of things like eyeglasses, tweed jackets with elbow patches, and offices in buildings covered in ivy as being professorial. The word stems from the Latin <i>professor</i>, "person who professes to be an expert."</p></div></div>`;
