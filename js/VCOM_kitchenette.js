If your fancy hotel suite has a <i>kitchenette</i>, you can make popcorn in the microwave.</p><p class="long">The suffix <i>-ette</i> is used as a diminutive, to mean "a small version," and that's just what a kitchenette is â€” a kitchen, but smaller. Sometimes a kitchenette is distinguished by its pint-sized appliances, like miniature refrigerators and narrow stovetops. It might also be missing certain standard elements of a kitchen, like a sink or a dishwasher. If you're staying in a hotel or living in a college dorm, a kitchenette can be all the kitchen you need.</p></div>`;
