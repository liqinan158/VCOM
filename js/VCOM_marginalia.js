When you buy a novel at a used book store, you may discover the previous owner's <i>marginalia</i> among its pages.</p><p class="long">The notes a student takes while reading often end up in the margins of the book. This marginalia might help the reader think critically and carefully about the text, or even act as a study aid later when there's a test on the material. <i>Marginalia</i> gets its name from the fact that it's written in the <i>margin</i>, which in turn comes from the Latin <i>marginem</i>, "edge or border."</p></div>`;
