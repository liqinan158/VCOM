The style originated in Japan, and while anything can be the subject, most traditional <i>haiku</i> are about nature.</p><p class="long">Here’s a haiku: "If you can’t pronounce / the word haiku, remember / big HIGH, little coo."  The word <i>haiku</i> is a shortened version of the Japanese phrase <i>haikai no ku</i>, which translates as “light verse.” Most haiku are simple poems, often about natural wonders. They don’t always need to follow the 5-7-5 syllable rule, like this haiku from 17th-century samurai poet Masahide: "Barn’s burnt down — / now / I can see the moon."</p></div>`;
