A person who's <i>reactive</i> does things only in response to others.</p><p class="long">To react is to do something in response to something else. When someone pinches you, for example, you react. But if you're a reactive person, then you only react; you're always ready to react but not to act on your own. You're rather lifeless unless something or someone else causes you to do act. This is usually seen as a negative trait in people, unless you're talking about, say, firefighters or cops. We admire people who don't need prodding to get things done. Some chemicals are called <i>reactive</i>, too, because they react readily with other chemicals.</p></div></div>`;
