You probably last saw <i>coral</i> while scuba diving at the Great Barrier Reef. That or while looking at the <i>coral</i> necklaces in the beach shop.</p><p class="long">Though coral looks like stone with little holes, it is actually a kind of sea polyp with a stony, hole filled skeleton. Sometimes the word <i>coral</i> refers to the skeleton itself. Because of the red color of Mediterranean coral, <i>coral</i> is also an adjective meaning pink-red. Shakespeare wrote: “My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun; <i>Coral</i> is far more “red than her lips' red.” <i>Coral</i> can also be a noun for unfertilized lobster eggs that turn red when cooking.</p></div></div>`;
