Well, that style of writing is <i>calligraphy,</i> and it's mostly used for important public documents.</p><p class="long">The word <i>calligraphy</i> comes from two Greek words stuck together, <i>kallos,</i> meaning "beauty," and <i>graphein,</i> meaning "to write" â€” literally "beautiful writing."
