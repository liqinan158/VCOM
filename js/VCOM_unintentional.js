It may be an unintentional result of last month's epic watermelon seed spitting contest. A little boy might cut his own hair into an unintentional Mohawk, and your wrong turn in an unfamiliar city might result in an unintentional visit to the zoo. The root word is the Latin <i>intentionem</i>, "a stretching out, straining, exertion, or effort," plus the prefix <i>un</i>, or "not."</p></div></div>`;
