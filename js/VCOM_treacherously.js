If you tell everyone in school your best friend's carefully guarded secret, you've behaved <i>treacherously</i>.</p><p class="long">Acting treacherously hurts or deceives another person, or betrays a secret or promise. A little boy might treacherously give away his sister's hiding place during a game of hide and seek â€” and his sister, in turn, might treacherously announce to some older kids that he's scared of the dark. In both cases, a secret has been betrayed. <i>Treacherously</i> comes from the adjective <i>treacherous</i>, with its Old French root word, <i>trechier</i>, "to cheat or trick."</p></div>`;
