If you're traveling, the <i>harbor</i> provided by a warm hotel is welcome. For ships, a <i>harbor</i> is a sheltered port area shielded from waves, where it's safe to dock.</p><p class="long"><i>Harbor</i> can also be used as a verb, which describes maintaining a belief or a feeling. If you harbor ill-will toward your neighbor John, you don't like him much. <i>Harbor</i> can also mean you hold back your ideas and don't express them openly. John may have no idea you hate him if you harbor your true feelings deep inside, but pretend you like him to his face.</p></div></div>`;
