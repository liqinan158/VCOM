Car engines, electric blankets, furnaces, and ovens are all equipped with thermostats so that people can change the temperature, or in the case of cars, so that the car itself can keep the engine at the ideal temperature. The noun <i>thermostat</i> comes from the Greek word for heat, <i>thermos</i>, plus <i>statos</i>, or "a standing."</p></div>`;
