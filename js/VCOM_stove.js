If you want really delicious popcorn, don't use the microwave — cook it the old-fashioned way, in a pot of hot oil on the <i>stove</i>.</p><p class="long">Stoves typically use gas or electricity. If you have a wood-burning stove in your house, you know it's an apparatus that burns split logs to create enough heat to warm up a room — or several rooms. In the 15th century, <i>stove</i> meant either "heated room" or "bathroom." Experts aren't sure about the word's origin, although some guess a connection to Vulgar Latin's <i>extufare</i>, "take a steam bath."</p></div></div>`;
