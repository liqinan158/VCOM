Regular people talk, people wearing tuxedos and beaded evening gowns <i>confabulate</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Confabulate</i> means to talk, but it also refers to creating a memory that’s unreal, like a fable, without being aware of it. If you suffer from memory loss, you might <i>confabulate</i> to fill in the blanks. The word comes from the Latin <i>com-</i> for "together" and <i>fabulari</i> for "to talk," which comes from <i>fabula</i> for "a tale." Whew. For a long time, <i>confabulate</i> just meant “to talk,” but the psychiatric sense came later.</p></div>`;
