Now it refers to pants made from this material: jeans. Dungarees are casual pants worn for hanging out or doing physical work. Dungarees are tough clothes, though they eventually tend to get holes in the knees. Not many clothes, at least in the U.S., are more popular than dungarees, which range from cheap and rugged to expensive and fashionable.</p></div>`;
