If so, it won’t surprise you that the adjective <i>voluble</i> traces back to the Latin word <i>volvere</i>, meaning “to roll.” The word <i>voluble</i> describes talking continuously, fluently, at great length, in a steady flow. You’ll know it when you meet <i>voluble</i> talkers: they just keep rolling on and on.</p></div>`;
