Businesses often talk about their finances, meaning how much money they're making or losing, and how their financial future looks. Sometimes, this word is a euphemism: "My finances are spiraling downward" sounds better than "I am flat-out broke." When you're discussing finances, you're talking about every possible aspect of money.</p></div></div>`;
