But instead of a building, you might <i>found</i> a business or a charity, where you establish the groundwork upon which it can grow.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>found</i> goes back to the Latin word <i>fundus</i>, meaning "bottom," which in turn led to <i>fundāre</i>, meaning "to lay the bottom of something."   If you were to found a library, they might build a statue of you near the entrance.  If you're having trouble finding the library, look for a statue with a familiar face.</p></div></div>`;
