A patriotic song might <i>arouse</i> your love of country, and a new idea might <i>arouse</i> your imagination.</p><p class="long">The word comes from an Old French word meaning "stir up, awaken," and anything that arouses your mind or heart can awaken something in you; for example, the prospect of an exciting experience may arouse your sense of adventure. <i>Arouse</i> can also be used with negative feelings. A sneaky look might arouse your suspicion, or rejection might arouse a sense of bitterness. However, usually, <i>arouse</i> carries with it a sense of excitement, of bringing something to life.</p></div></div>`;
