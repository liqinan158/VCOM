Licenses, wills, and privileges are three things that can be <i>revoked</i>. The verb also has a meaning specific to card- playing. If the rules state that you have to follow suit, but you accidentally play trump instead, you have revoked or reneged. If other players notice your mistake, you have to take the card back.</p></div></div>`;
