You can call the corner itself a <i>quoin</i>, or use the word for the special stones or bricks that reinforce corners of brick or stone buildings.</p><p class="long">You're most likely to come across the word <i>quoin</i> in a discussion of architecture, since it's a term that has to do with either the aesthetics or strength of a building. Some quoins are decorative features, providing variety and pattern to the corner where two exterior walls meet. Others have an important structural job, strengthening buildings by reinforcing the corners.  <i>Quoin</i> was originally an alternative way to spell <i>coin</i>, and was used to mean "cornerstone" or "wedge."</p></div></div>`;
