The practical purpose of a flying buttress is to help hold the heavy wall up by pushing from the outside—a buttress is a support—but it also serves an aesthetic purpose. Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris is probably the most famous building in the world constructed with flying buttresses.</p></div></div>`;
