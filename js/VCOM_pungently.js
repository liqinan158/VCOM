A movie critic might review a film pungently, for example, mocking its terrible acting and describing its ridiculous plot in biting terms. <i>Pungently</i> comes from <i>pungent</i>, originally "sharp or poignant," which is rooted in the Latin verb <i>pungere</i> "to prick, pierce, or sting."</p></div></div>`;
