The back of a trilobite's body had three sections, or lobes. The word <i>trilobite</i>, in fact, means "three lobes" in Greek, from <i>tri</i> and <i>lobos</i>. We know a lot about trilobites, especially considering they've been extinct for a long time, because their exoskeletons were easily fossilized.</p></div>`;
