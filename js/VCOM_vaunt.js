It's over-the-top showing off, and when you exaggerate your greatness, you <i>vaunt</i> to the point of no longer seeming so great.</p><p class="long">From the Latin <i>vānitāre</i> — which comes from <i>vānus</i>, meaning "vain" or "empty" — <i>vaunt</i> is a verb for taking praise too far or talking something up too much. Even if it's earned or deserved bragging, vaunting about something gets old and loses it impact. Other times, <i>vaunt</i>, as a noun, is a sure sign that a hard sell is going on — someone is talking big but can't deliver.</p></div>`;
