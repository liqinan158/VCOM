You may love to gorge on ice cream, but the stomachache afterward won't be very pleasant. To remember the "canyon" meaning, think of the famous upstate New York bumper sticker, “Ithaca is <i>gorges</i>.” It's a play on <i>gorgeous</i>, meaning beautiful, and the beautiful ravines in the area.</p></div>`;
