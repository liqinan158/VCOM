If the rambunctious kids you're babysitting get into a <i>tussle</i>, you may have to separate them for a while and calm them down.</p><p class="long">Though a tussle is often a physical fight, it's rarely a serious one. Two wrestling dogs, a couple of scuffling teenagers â€” these are examples of tussles. The word <i>tussle</i> is Scottish, a variant of <i>touselen</i>, which is related to <i>tousle</i>, or "dishevel or muss," which you might do to a little kid's hair. The root of both is the Old English <i>tousen</i>, "handle or push about roughly."</p></div></div>`;
