For example, you might <i>voluntarily</i> stay home and babysit your little brother if the alternative is a trip to the grocery store.</p><p class="long">People do things voluntarily when they are completely willing to do them, not forced or enticed by anyone else. Kids tend to eat candy voluntarily, ride their bikes with their friends voluntarily, and watch their favorite shows on TV voluntarily. It's easy to see the connection with the verb <i> to volunteer</i>, and both words are rooted in the Latin root <i>voluntarius</i>, "of one's free will."</p></div>`;
