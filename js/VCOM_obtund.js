If your senses have been <i>obtunded</i>, you are probably pretty out of it.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>obtund</i> is rare today, used mainly in medical terminology, and usually in the form of the adjective <i>obtunded</i>. It's been around since about 1400, meaning "to make dull" or "to make less sensitive," and rooted in the Latin <i>obtundere</i>, "to blunt or weaken," or literally "to beat against." It's a close relative of <i>obtuse</i>, which means "dull or blunted," but usually describes a person who is extremely insensitive to others' feelings.</p></div></div>`;
