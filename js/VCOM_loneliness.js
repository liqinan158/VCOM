Your <i>loneliness</i> might lead you to sit at home listening to depressing songs, or it could inspire you to go out and meet people.</p><p class="long">You can be alone â€” and enjoy every minute of it. But from time to time, most of us experience loneliness. It's a feeling of sadness or even anxiety that occurs when you want company. On the other hand, it is possible to feel loneliness in a crowd, especially if you aren't interacting with others, like in a crowded subway car or busy grocery store.  Even a place can have a sense of loneliness, like an empty room just after all your guests have left.</p></div></div>`;
