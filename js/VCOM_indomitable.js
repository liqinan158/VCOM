People described as having <i>indomitable</i> spirits don't need pep talks or protein shakes; their strength comes from within.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>indomitable</i> starts with the Latin prefix <i>in</i>, which means "not." The second part of the word is also from the Latin word <i>domitare</i>, meaning "to tame." So the word literally means "not able to be tamed." <i>Indomitable</i> is often teamed with the words <i>spirit</i> or <i>personality</i> to describe someone with a can-do attitude.</p></div></div>`;
