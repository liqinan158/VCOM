Someone might have a <i>flair</i> for throwing fantastic parties, or a <i>flair</i> for solving complex math problems.</p><p class="long">Something or someone with flair is flashy, catchy and full of energy. But oddly enough, <i>flair</i> meant "odor" when it originated in the mid 14th century. It wasn’t until 1925 that the word came to mean a distinctive talent, elegant style or dashing ability. So maybe think of someone absolutely reeking of style and panache — but in a good way.</p></div>`;
