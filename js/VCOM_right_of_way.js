Often, beaches are accessible to the public via a <i>right of way</i> through someone's property.</p><p class="long">Use the legal phrase <i>right of way</i> whether you're talking about the physical path or route that people are permitted to use, or their right to use that path. When you're driving, <i>right of way</i> refers to one driver's right to proceed first, or a pedestrian's right to use a crosswalk, for example. At a four-way stop, the driver who stops first has the right of way, so they also get to drive through the intersection first.</p></div>`;
