One minute it's summer and the next, winter. <i>Variability</i> means the tendency to shift or change â€” of being "variable."</p><p class="long">There are many words that contain <i>vari-</i>, and they almost all have to do with change or difference. <i>Variability</i> is the noun version of this idea. The variability of the weather means that you never know exactly what to wear. T-shirt or sweater: the choices vary along with the weather. Many things are known for their variability: the taste of teenagers, the talent of the singers on "American Idol," Frank Sinatra's moods. These are just some of the things that exhibit real variability.</p></div></div>`;
