If you walk into a party smiling and generally seeming up for whatever, your <i>affability</i> will draw people to you. <i>Affability</i> and intelligence will get you far in this world!</p><p class="long">To be affable is to be friendly and good-natured. The quality itself is called affability. Smiling and making jokes shows affability, and so does being friendly to strangers. Someone who tends to get along with everyone and has many friends has affability. In the Old French, it was <i>affabilit√©</i>, from the Latin root <i>affabilis</i>, for "approachable, courteous, or kind," and literally means "can be easily spoken to."</p></div></div>`;
