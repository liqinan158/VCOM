Anything that makes you sad, gloomy, or mournful can be called <i>lugubrious</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Lugubrious</i> comes from the Latin verb <i>lūgēre</i>, "to mourn." You can also listen to the sound of the word: <i>lugubrious</i> sounds slow, heavy, and sad. Sometimes, just the "feel" of a word is enough to clue you in to its meaning, and <i>lugubrious</i> is one of those words. I was feeling great when I got to the concert, but the lugubrious music left me in a terrible mood.</p></div>`;
