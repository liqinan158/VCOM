If you feel a strong <i>vibration</i> in your car every time you step on the brakes, it might be a good idea to take it to a mechanic.</p><p class="long">You might feel a vibration in your floor when your neighbor is playing his music too loudly, and you'll know a thunderstorm is approaching when you feel the vibration of your trembling dog at your side. The rapid back and forth movement or quivering of an electric toothbrush or a mild earthquake is a vibration. The Latin <i>vibratus</i>, "move quickly to and fro" is the root word.</p></div>`;
