Some restaurants and supermarkets use <i>rotisseries</i> for roasting whole chickens.</p><p class="long">A rotisserie uses a spit, a long skewer or metal rod that holds a large piece of meat. The spit rotates so that the meat cooks evenly and is constantly basting in its own juices. In the mid-1800s, the word <i>rotisserie</i> referred to a restaurant serving meat that was cooked this way, from the French <i>rôtisserie</i>, "restaurant," and <i>rôtir</i>, "to roast."</p></div></div>`;
