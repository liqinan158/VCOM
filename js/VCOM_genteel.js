var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">genteel</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Although the adjective <i>genteel</i> means high-class and refined, it is often used today in a somewhat mocking tone, as though good manners and elegance are passé. Still, it would be nice if more people were a little more <i>genteel</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>genteel</i> comes from the Old French word <i>gentil</i>, "high-born, noble." We can see the similarity to the word <i>gentle</i>, as in <i>gentleman</i> and <i>gentlewoman</i>. The word is especially powerful in describing Chaucer's Knight in the <i>Canterbury Tales</i> as "a verray, parfit gentil knyght" — "a true, perfect, noble knight," dignified, patrician, and as genteel as they come. Today, it describes someone elegant, fashionable, and well-bred. Picture someone in riding jodhpurs reading "Town and Country" while astride a magnificent show horse.</p></div>`;
