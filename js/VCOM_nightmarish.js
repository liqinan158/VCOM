Your <i>nightmarish</i> day might start with a car accident on the way to school and end with a fight with your best friend.</p><p class="long">A chilling scream in the middle of the night is nightmarish, and traumatic experiences like an episode of bullying or nearly stumbling off the top of a cliff would also be nightmarish. You can also use this adjective to emphasize the unpleasantness of an experience in a slightly exaggerated way: "Ugh, that math test was absolutely <i>nightmarish</i>." Nightmarish things resemble nightmares, or terrifying dreams.</p></div></div>`;
