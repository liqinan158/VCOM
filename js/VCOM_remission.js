var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">remission</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Remission</i> refers to a stage of lesser intensity, when something subsides or improves. Remission is usually a good thing â€” like when your cancer is in <i>remission</i>, it means that it is manageable and not getting any worse.</p><p class="long"><i>Remission</i> comes from the Latin <i>remissionem</i>, meaning "relaxation; a sending back." If something difficult lets up, you'll be able to relax a little. For example, if you are being pelted non-stop during a dodgeball game, you'd hope for a remission so you'd have a minute to take a breath and find your glasses. Another meaning of the noun <i>remission</i> is a payment. Your college tuition remission must be taken care of before you start classes.</p></div>`;
