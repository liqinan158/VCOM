If you have never missed a broadcast of your favorite TV show for the last five years, then you're <i>religious</i> about it.</p><p class="long">Just as religion is a broad concept with multiple manifestations, the word <i>religious</i> can be used in many contexts. You could literally be describing someone's particular religious duties as prescribed by his religion. If you have a religious temperament, you think about spiritual things a lot. If someone is a fanatic about football, you could describe him as a religious fan. That doesn't mean he thinks the football is God, just that he really, really cares.</p></div>`;
