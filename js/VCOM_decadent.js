Typically, though, we use <i>decadent</i> as an adjective to describe wasteful indulgence or extravagance. Celebrities who find themselves unable to manage sudden fame and fortune sometimes go overboard, throwing million-dollar parties, living the fast life, turning to drugs and alcohol. And because they're famous, we read about them and their decadent lifestyles in the tabloid papers.</p></div></div>`;
