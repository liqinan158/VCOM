Your math teacher might teach you how to graph <i>collinear</i> points.</p><p class="long">Although you're most likely to encounter the word <i>collinear</i> in a math textbook, it's sometimes used more generally to mean "in a row." So if you want to sound impressive, you could describe the collinear ducks crossing the street. Mathematically, it's good to know that two points are always collinear, since you can connect them with a straight line. <i>Collinear</i> has its roots in Latin, with the prefix <i>col-</i> meaning "with" and <i>līneāris</i>, "belonging to a line."</p></div></div>`;
