Hong Kong and La Quiaca, Argentina are examples of <i>antipodes</i>.</p><p class="long">If you drew a line from one geographical location, straight through the center of the Earth, to another location, those two places would be antipodes. If someone refers to the Antipodes, with a capital <i>A</i>, they mean Australia and New Zealand (although only inhabitants of the Northern Hemisphere refer to them this way). You can also use this word figuratively, to describe opposites: "My brother and I are total antipodes â€” he's sporty, and I'm a bookworm."</p></div>`;
