You scoop out the mud with a big shovel, which is also called a <i>dredge,</i> and make a channel deep enough for ships.</p><p class="long">Dredges have been at work in the Hudson River for years getting rid of industrial toxins, dredging up the contaminated sediment and loading it into barges to be carried away. If  your car rolled into a lake by mistake, you might be able to hire a dredge that can be dragged across the bottom of the lake to recover things that have fallen in. You can dredge up memories, too, which usually entails reminding people of unpleasant ones theyâ€™d rather forget.</p></div>`;
