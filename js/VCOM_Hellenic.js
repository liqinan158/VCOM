Your favorite Hellenic treat may be baklava, while your brother prefers savory spanakopita. And if you dream of a Hellenic adventure, you hope for the chance to travel to Greece one day (the country's official name is, in fact, the Hellenic Republic). The Greek root is <i>HellÄ“n</i>, known in mythology as "the ancestor," or the original Greek.</p></div></div>`;
