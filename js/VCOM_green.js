Grass, trees, and plants are varying shades of green, and so is the lettuce that's used to make "a <i>green</i> salad." <i>Green</i> also means "unripe" as in a tomato, or "inexperienced," as in someone who's new at a job. In the 16th century, Shakespeare coined the phrase "the <i>green</i>-ey'd monster," and since then <i>green</i> has symbolized jealousy or envy.</p></div></div>`;
