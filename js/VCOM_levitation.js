You may see <i>levitation</i> that appears entirely real at a magic show, with silver balls or scarves appearing to linger in midair.</p><p class="long">In the illusion of levitation, a magician raises an object or person into the air, and a psychic or medium's levitation might consist of a table rising slowly into the air. There are also scientifically valid examples of levitation, from the simple occurrence of a feather being blown upward by a breeze to magnetic levitation, when a powerful magnet exerts a force that's strong enough to raise a metal object into the air.</p></div></div>`;
