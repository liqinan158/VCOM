But wiggly Jell-O is actually <i>congealed</i> liquid, so it can't be that bad, right?</p><p class="long">This word comes to us from the Old French word <i>congeler</i>, which means "to freeze." So when something congeals it goes from liquid to solid form, almost like freezing. No one usually likes congealed anything — whether it's chunkified old soup in the fridge or dried blood on a wound. See? Pretty gross. Jell-O is about as good as congealed gets!</p></div>`;
