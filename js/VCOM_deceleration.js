When you're on a Ferris wheel, its deceleration tells you that the ride is almost over, and the deceleration of a train at a railroad crossing happens for safety reasons. The opposite of <i>deceleration</i> is <i>acceleration</i>, or speeding up. The word <i>deceleration</i> was originally an 1890's railroad term, constructed by adding <i>de</i>, or "the opposite of" to <i>acceleration</i>.</p></div>`;
