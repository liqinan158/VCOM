You should try <i>goulash</i> if you ever get the chance to visit Hungary, where it's one of the national dishes.</p><p class="long">The Hungarian word for this delicious dish is <i>gulyáshús</i>, from <i>gulyás</i>, "herdsman," and <i>hús</i>, "meat." Historically, goulash was a stew cooked by shepherds using lamb or beef. The paprika came later, but today it's a vital part of an authentic goulash. North Americans sometimes use the word for a mixture of beef, macaroni, and tomato sauce, but true goulash is spicy and thick — and it definitely doesn't include macaroni.</p></div></div>`;
