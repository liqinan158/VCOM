Your <i>emulation</i> of your older brother on the tennis court might create a rivalry between you, as you become a better player.</p><p class="long"><i>Emulation</i> comes from the Latin <i>aemulat-</i> meaning "rivaled, equaled," but we usually use <i>emulation</i> in a non-competitive sense, like the emulation of a role model. Having a role model can be useful. Your emulation of that person can help keep you focused toward your goal. It's when that admiration turns into a competitive obsession that emulation becomes a problem. In computing, emulation is the technique used so one machine gets the same results as another.</p></div>`;
