When you ride an ocean wave, hear a favorite song, or have a long and uncontrollable laugh with friends, there's a feeling of <i>exhilaration,</i> an overflow of happiness.</p><p class="long">Most people have moments of exhilaration (egg-zill-uh-RAY-shun), sometimes during life's big moments, like a graduation or wedding, and often while just walking down the street and feeling great about the day and being alive. And exhilaration is contagious: when you witness someone else's exhilaration, it usually makes you full of warmth and joyousness too. Some synonyms of <i>exhilaration</i> also sound close to it, like "exultation," "exaltation," and "elation." As they say, it's all good.</p></div>`;
