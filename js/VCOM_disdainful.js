To be <i>disdainful</i> is to act mean and superior.</p><p class="long">If you're acting haughty, imperious, lordly, overbearing, prideful, sniffy, supercilious, or swaggering, you're acting disdainful. The great Michael Jordan was known to be disdainful of his opponents — and even teammates who couldn't keep up with him. Arrogant people with their nose in the air are disdainful. This can also have an even harsher sense, meaning <i>contemptuous</i>. Either way, that person who gave you the disdainful look doesn’t like you (or at least something you did) very much.</p></div></div>`;
