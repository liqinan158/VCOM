Although sometimes it looks more like orange, “orangehead” isn’t a thing. Only about one percent of the entire population is a real <i>redhead</i>. In England, a <i>redhead</i> is “ginger” haired.</p><p class="long">Redheads come in many different varieties, from bright red dyed hair to coppery auburn and strawberry blond. Many natural redheads have pale skin that burns easily in the sun and light-colored eyes. The word <i>redhead</i> has been used to mean someone with red hair since at least the 13th century. Even today, kids are sometimes teased for being redheads, but in the Middle Ages, red hair could mark you as a witch or a vampire.</p></div>`;
