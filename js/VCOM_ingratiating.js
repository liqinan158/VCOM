A person who is ingratiating is trying to get in the favor or grace of those around her. But the word doesn't always have to imply a sly attempt at winning others over, sometimes it can simply mean charming or agreeable. A person's smile can be ingratiating, winning people over simply with its charm.</p></div>`;
