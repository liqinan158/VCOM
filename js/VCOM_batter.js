You can batter by hitting again and again, but there's also a <i>batter</i> in baseball â€” the guy who's holding a bat and waiting for the pitcher to throw the ball. Yet another meaning is the batter you mix up when you're making muffins, using eggs, flour, milk, and sugar. They all come from the same Latin root word, <i>battuere</i>, "to beat or strike."</p></div></div>`;
