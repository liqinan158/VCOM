A man who feels irrationally scared to use his new smartphone may suffer from <i>cyberphobia</i>.</p><p class="long">A <i>phobia</i> is an extreme, irrational fear, and <i>cyberphobia</i> is no different. While many people feel completely comfortable using computers, navigating the Internet, or installing applications on their phones, others find themselves terrified of these things â€” they have some degree of <i>cyberphobia</i>. The prevalence of technology in modern life has resulted in this new word, which combines <i>cyber</i>, a prefix used to mean "technology" or "the Internet" and <i>phobia</i>, from the Greek <i>phobos</i>, "fear or terror."</p></div></div>`;
