Not necessarily. Some  people think that being selfish is the best thing to do for the world as a whole. In other words, if everyone is selfish, everyone will be better off. So egoism can be considered positive or negative — it all depends how someone uses the word. This makes <i>egoism</i> different from <i>egotism</i> — an always yucky type of selfishness.</p></div>`;
