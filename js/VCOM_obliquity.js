The <i>obliquity</i> of many politicians makes it hard to get a straight answer from them.</p><p class="long">If your teacher comments on the obliquity of your poem, it may be a compliment, or it may mean your writing is just hard to understand. And while obliquity isn't a bad quality in a poet, it's less desirable in a math tutor, or anyone who needs to be straightforward and clear. We can trace the origin of <i>obliquity</i> back to the Latin <i>obliquus</i>, "slanting, sidelong, or indirect."</p></div></div>`;
