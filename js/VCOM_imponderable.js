Use <i>imponderable</i>  to describe something that is elusive and vague, perhaps even evasive. When your question doesn't have a definitive answer, you are in <i>imponderable</i> territory: "Life has many <i>imponderable</i> questions, such as why you park in a driveway and drive on parkway."</p></div></div>`;
