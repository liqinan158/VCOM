Cramming all of your dirty clothes into the closet gives the <i>semblance,</i> or false appearance, that you've done your laundry â€” but the stench might give you away.</p><p class="long"><i>Semblance</i> comes from the 14th-century French word for "resemble," and it is a noun for things that look one way on the outside but are very different on the inside. A popular combination is to say that a person or place has the "<i>semblance</i> of order," when, underneath, everything is out of control.</p></div></div>`;
