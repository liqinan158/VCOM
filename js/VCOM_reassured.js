When you're worried about the safety of a friend who's traveling, you'll be <i>reassured</i> to hear her voice on the telephone.</p><p class="long">You might be reassured to get a college acceptance letter after worrying that you won't get in anywhere, or feel reassured after visiting your grandmother that her new apartment is perfect for her, as sad as she was to move out of her old house. The adjective <i>reassured</i> dates from the 1500's, with its meaning "restore someone to confidence" coming from the prefix <i>re</i>, "back or again," and <i>assure</i>, from the Vulgar Latin <i>assecurar</i>, "to secure or to reassure."</p></div>`;
