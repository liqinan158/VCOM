When a party-goer breaks open a pi√±ata, the other guests usually <i>grab</i> wildly at the candy that cascades out of it.</p><p class="long">You can grab for the string of a balloon as it floats away, or grab your friend in a hug. Another way to grab is to make an impression: "When I hear a marching band, it <i>grabs</i> my attention." A "<i>grab</i> bag" is a random mixture of things, or a bag of goodies you can reach into and grab from. If something's "up for <i>grabs</i>." it's available: "This last piece of pie is up for <i>grabs</i>!"</p></div>`;
