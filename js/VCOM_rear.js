You can also use <i>rear</i> informally to mean "bottom" or "hindquarters," as an adjective meaning "toward the back," or as a verb: "The horses started to <i>rear</i> up on their back legs." The verb comes from a Germanic root meaning "to raise," while the noun is rooted in the Latin <i>retro</i>, "behind."</p></div>`;
