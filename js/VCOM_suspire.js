You might <i>suspire</i> melodramatically as you listen to your best friend complain about her allowance for the thousandth time.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>suspire</i> is considered obsolete todayâ€”you'll probably only encounter it when you're reading poetry. In Robert Frost's poem "Sitting by a Bush in Broad Sunlight," he wrote: "And from that one intake of fire / All creatures still warmly suspire." Not only is it a literary way to say "breathe," but it also rhymes nicely with "fire." The Latin root is <i>spirare</i>, "to breathe."</p></div>`;
