If you show up to class on time and refrain from riding your skateboard down the halls, you <i>toe the line</i> at school.</p><p class="long">When you toe the line, you acknowledge what has to be done to fit in with a particular group. If you're going to make it in the U.S. Army, you'll have to toe the line during basic training. The origin of this phrase is a mystery, but various theories include a school-related source: during roll-call or attendance, students commonly lined up with their toes touching a line on the floor.</p></div>`;
