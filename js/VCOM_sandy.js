A <i>sandy</i> beach is lovely; a <i>sandy</i> bed is just uncomfortable.</p><p class="long">If your dog tracks sand indoors and spreads it all over the place, you've got a sandy house. If your sister's hair is the brownish color of sand, you can describe it as sandy too. And if you spill your ingredients when you're making a cake, you might realize that sugar and flour both look a little sandy when they're on the floor. <i>Sandy</i> comes from the Old English <i>sandig</i>, "of the nature of sand."</p></div>`;
