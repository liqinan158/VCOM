It's the adjective form of the noun <i>caprice</i>, which means a sudden change of mood. <i>Caprice</i> might come from <i>capra</i>, the Italian word for "goat" (because goats are frisky), or from <i>capo</i>, "head" + <i>riccio</i>, "hedgehog." Why bring hedgehogs into it? If you have a "hedgehog head," you are so scared that your hair is standing straight on end. A scared person makes sudden starts this way and that, just as a capricious person does.</p></div></div>`;
