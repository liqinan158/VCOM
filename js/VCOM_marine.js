Your friend in the U.S. Armed Services who is a <i>Marine</i> probably spends a lot of time near the ocean.</p><p class="long">Marine life is everything that lives in the water: plants, fish, sharks, algae, crabs, seahorses, giant squid, and the list goes on and on. When you study things that live in or near the sea, you are either a marine biologist or just really excited about ocean life. If you work in a field that deals with the ocean, boats, sailors or the navy you could be, for instance, a marine meteorologist.</p></div></div>`;
