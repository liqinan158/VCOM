After three days of rain, your backyard just might be too <i>marshy</i> to set up the volleyball net.</p><p class="long">Any area of ground that's waterlogged is marshy, like the marshy shore of a river or the low-lying marshy patch in the neighborhood dog park. Unless there's a drought, swamps and bogs and wetlands are always marshy, and water-loving plants grow happily in these areas. This adjective comes from <i>marsh</i>, which has a Germanic root, <i>mari</i>, that means "sea."</p></div>`;
