Fisherman use worm decoys on their lures to catch fish, just like police use people as undercover decoys to catch criminals. While etymologists aren't positive, they suspect <i>decoy</i> comes from the Dutch <i>kooi</i>, which means “a cage.” So think of luring a mouse into a cage with a big slice of decoy cheese.</p></div></div>`;
