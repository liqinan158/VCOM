Either meaning can mean great pain to the person experiencing the <i>stricture</i>.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>stricture</i> finds its roots in the Late Latin word <i>strictūra</i>, which came from the stem <i>stringere</i>, "to draw tightly." You might remember that meaning by its relationship with the word <i>constrict</i>, meaning "to tighten or draw in." The additional meaning, that of “a critical remark,” is often used in the plural form — like "the critical <i>strictures</i> against cheating."</p></div>`;
