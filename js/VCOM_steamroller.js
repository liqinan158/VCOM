Be sure to stay out of its way!</p><p class="long">Many people use the word <i>steamroller</i> to mean "road roller," although strictly speaking that's incorrect, since these modern vehicles aren't powered by a steam engine. A true steamroller had a smokebox and chimney, and the steam it produced enabled it to move forward as it rolled and compressed the surface below. Used figuratively, <i>steamroller</i> means something or someone that moves forward relentlessly, without regard for anyone who happens to be in its way.</p></div>`;
