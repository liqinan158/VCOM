Immediately after the Winter Olympics, interest in ice skating, bobsledding, and curling tends to <i>skyrocket</i>, or increase suddenly and dramatically.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>skyrocket</i> is good to use when something grows or shoots up as abruptly as a firework. Gas prices, food prices, debt, and winter cases of the flu are all said, from time to time, to skyrocket. A more literal meaning of <i>skyrocket</i> is the actual rocket that's designed to send a flare or firework high into the sky. A bottle rocket — a firework that is placed in an empty bottle before being lit and shooting into the air — is one example of a small skyrocket.</p></div></div>`;
