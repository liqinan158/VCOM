You might be <i>lovesick</i> if your love took off for Bali (unless of course you have plans to take off for Bali too).</p><p class="long">There are many different reasons for being lovesick: a lovesick boy might have a crush on a girl who barely notices him, and a lovesick teenager could be overwhelmed by feeling such strong emotions for the first time. Your grandmother's collection of old letters might include the ones she wrote as a new, lovesick wife when your grandfather was in the Army. <i>Lovesick</i> dates from the sixteenth century.</p></div>`;
