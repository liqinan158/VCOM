The word may make you think of China or Japan, and in fact most pagodas are found in those two countries, as well as other parts of Asia, including Cambodia, Nepal, and India. <i>Pagoda</i> comes from the Portuguese <i>pagode</i>, although its origin is uncertain. One possible root is the Tamil word <i>pagavadi</i>, "house belonging to a deity."</p></div>`;
