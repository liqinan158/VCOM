Goiters are a result of the thyroid gland producing too much or too little hormone. Goiters can also develop because you're not getting enough iodine in your diet. A goiter can be small, but it can also become extremely large and unsightly. If you even think you're getting a goiter, it's a good idea to see a doctor.</p></div></div>`;
