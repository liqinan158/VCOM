You might decide your sparkly faux-diamond <i>necklace</i> is a bit dressy for your cousin's baseball game â€” but perfect for a fancy dinner out.</p><p class="long">A necklace can be a simple gold or silver chain, a length of beads or gems, or a pendant hanging from a cord. As long as it's worn around the neck, it's a necklace. The word, which dates from the late 1500s, combines <i>neck</i> with <i>lace</i>, meaning "cord," from the Old French <i>laz</i>, "string, cord, or snare." The Latin root, <i>laqueum</i>, means "noose or snare."</p></div>`;
