You might wander <i>aimlessly</i> through the zoo on a summer afternoon, not sure which animal you feel like looking at.</p><p class="long">A road trip can be a long drive directly from one place to another, or it can look more like a couple of friends driving aimlessly along country highways, heading nowhere in particular. When someone is <i>aimless</i>, she has no real direction or specific plan â€” she's "without aim." The adverb <i>aimlessly</i> comes from this adjective, and it's equally random and unplanned.</p></div>`;
