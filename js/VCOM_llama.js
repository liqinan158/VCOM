You might not want to get too close, though â€” when <i>llamas</i> feel annoyed or threatened, they spit.</p><p class="long">A llama has a long neck and thick eyelashes, and looks kind of like a camel without a hump. Llamas are native to South America, but experts believe they originated in the plains of North America about 40 million years ago, eventually becoming extinct in that part of the world, at least in the wild. Llamas are used to carry heavy loads, to guard flocks of sheep and other animals, and for their soft wool.</p></div></div>`;
