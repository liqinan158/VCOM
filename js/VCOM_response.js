If you cry at sad movies, you're having an emotional <i>response</i> to the drama that's taking place on the screen.</p><p class="long">A <i>response</i> can come in many forms, including an answer to a question, an emotional reaction, or a reply. If a teacher asks, "Who invented the phonograph?" She hopes her students will give her the response, "Why, Thomas Edison, of course!" When a parent tells a child not to cross the street when the light is red, he hopes the response will be compliance.</p></div></div>`;
