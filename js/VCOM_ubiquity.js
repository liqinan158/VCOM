var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">ubiquity</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">It’s here, there, and everywhere! <i>Ubiquity</i> is the state of being everywhere all the time. Like a pop song that plays every place you go, or the <i>ubiquity</i> of mosquitoes in the summer or pollen in the spring. There’s no escape!</p><p class="long">A god is a great example of ubiquity: an all-knowing deity that exists in every nook and cranny. The Latin root word <i>ubique</i> means “everywhere,” and something with ubiquity is indeed everywhere, impossible to avoid. Sometimes ubiquity is a mind trick, like learning that a group of crows is called a "murder," and then noticing crows everywhere you go, all day long. Wherever you go, you're reminded of the ubiquity of crows.</p></div>`;
