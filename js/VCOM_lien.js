It's pronounced like "lean," which might also describe your meager finances if a <i>lien</i> has been placed on your home.</p><p class="long">When someone doesn't make payments on a loan, the bank may put a lien on that person's property, claiming ownership of that property until the overdue payment is received. The word <i>lien</i> derives from the Latin <i>ligƒÅre</i>, which means "to bind," and you can see that "binding," or tying up a person's property, really does put the owner in a "bind."</p></div></div>`;
