To be truly Rabelaisian, a piece of writing should also be sharp and smart, exuberant and exciting, and aimed at a highly educated, literate audience. François Rabelais, who wrote in sixteenth century France, was known for his huge vocabulary and skill with the French language, as well as jokes that were vulgar enough — Rabelaisian, in other words — to get his books banned from many places.</p></div>`;
