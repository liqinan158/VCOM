If you lack needed food and shelter, you're <i>poor,</i> and if you fall below a standard or don't even try, you're giving a <i>poor</i> performance. Empty pockets and empty efforts both mean <i>poor.</i></p><p class="long"><i>Rich</i> or <i>wealthy</i> often serve as opposites of <i>poor.</i> If you have material things, you're rich, and if you don't, you're poor. You can be full of knowledge but get poor grades if you're not studying, or you might be poor in terms of money but rich in friends and kindness. <i>Poor</i> can also be used as a noun, as in "Charity is aimed at helping the <i>poor</i>."</p></div>`;
