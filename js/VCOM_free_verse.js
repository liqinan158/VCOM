Free verse poetry began in the 19th century as a rejection of the rules in favor of other ways of organizing a poem. Much contemporary poetry is free verse. If you look at something like Shakespeare’s sonnets, on the other hand, you can see that it has strict rules: 14 lines with a couplet at the end, and no arguments!</p></div></div>`;
