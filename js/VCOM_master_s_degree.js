After you get a bachelor's degree, you may want to also earn a <i>master's degree</i>.</p><p class="long">When you get a master's degree, you focus on one subject â€” the goal of a master's degree is mastery, or expertise, in that area. The term has been around since the fourteenth century, when a master's degree was required to teach in a university. This has changed over the years, and now a PhD, an even more advanced degree, is usually needed to be a professor. The Latin root of <i>master</i>, <i>magister</i>, means "teacher."</p></div>`;
