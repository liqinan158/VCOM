Throughout history, dominant groups have used <i>lynchings</i> as a way of controlling minorities.</p><p class="long">When people take the law into their own hands and decide to punish a suspected criminal — or merely a person who's seen as challenging the status quo — the result can unfortunately be a lynching. Lynchings have most often involved hanging, especially during the period of racially motivated lynchings in the American South. The word <i>lynching</i> and its related verb, <i>lynch</i>, come from Captain William Lynch, who took control of imposing and policing order in Virginia during the Revolutionary War.</p></div>`;
