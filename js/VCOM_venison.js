Back then, venison was as common as a Big Mac today (rather than as the fairly classy meal it's considered today). In Britain, before 1066, when the French came over and conquered them, the Brits had pretty simple names for their meat: cow, pig, deer, etc. The French, with their high regard for cuisine, changed all that, and the names became <i>beef,</i> <i>bacon,</i> and <i>venison.</i> The British, though, despite the fancy new names, famously refused to take cooking as seriously as their new French rulers.</p></div></div>`;
