Apartment dwellers and others who can't wash clothing and linens at home are dependent on their neighborhood Laundromats. The word was first used in the 1940's, when it referred to a specific brand of washing machine. <i>Laundromat</i> is a combination of the words <i>launder</i> and <i>automatic</i>.</p></div>`;
