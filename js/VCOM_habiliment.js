You may want to get up extra early on the first day of school so you have time to choose the perfect <i>habiliments</i> to wear.</p><p class="long">When you come across this unusual word, you'll almost always see it in its plural form, <i>habiliments</i>. In this way, it's similar to the word <i>clothes</i> â€” and they also share a meaning, "items worn to cover the body." The original 15th-century definition of <i>habiliments</i> was "weapons or munitions," from the Middle French word <i>abiller</i>, "prepare or fit out."</p></div>`;
