Most bicycles have one <i>seat</i>, while many motorcycles have two <i>seats</i>.</p><p class="long">If your teacher invites you to "Take a <i>seat</i>," he means "Find a chair and sit in it." There are seats in cars and airplanes, around tables, in restaurants, and in movie theaters. As a verb, <i>seat</i> means "help someone find a place to sit," the way an usher seats audience members at a concert. Some people also use <i>seat</i> to mean "bottom" or "buttocks," or the section of your pants that covers this body part.</p></div></div>`;
