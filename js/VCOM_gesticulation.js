Some stand-up comedians dash across the stage, throwing their hands around, as they act out what they are talking about. These <i>gesticulations</i> become part of the act.</p><p class="long">You can see the word <i>gesture</i> in <i>gesticulation</i>. When you gesture, you move in a way that communicates feelings about what you're saying, such as shrugging your shoulders while saying, "I don't know."  A gesticulation is even more emphatic than that â€” a gesture might be a shrug of the shoulders, but add upturned palms and a comical facial expression that shows confusion and you have gesticulation.</p></div>`;
