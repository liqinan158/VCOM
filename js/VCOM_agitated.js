If you have ever walked into a room and instantly been asked, "What's wrong?" you probably looked <i>agitated</i>.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>agitate</i> means "to shake up." So someone who is agitated has been shaken up by something â€” disturbing news, a careless driver who nearly caused a huge accident, or just a very long, very bad day. <i>Agitated</i> can also describe being activated, or fired up about something. For example, a political cause might be losing steam until an event like a rally gets everyone agitated all over again.</p></div></div>`;
