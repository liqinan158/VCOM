The idea of the word referring to numerals began around 1938, soon becoming vital in computers. It's easy to imagine the connection between fingers and numbers, as the first mathematical "calculators" were probably fingers and toes.  Digital recording appeared in 1960 to challenge analog, soon becoming the broadcasting standard for clearer signals.</p></div>`;
