It is common in math and science, but it can refer to anything that differs from the expected.</p><p class="long"><i>Deviation</i> in nature is an important part of evolution. When something causes a creatureâ€™s DNA to change, it creates a <i>deviation</i>, or a changed characteristic. If the <i>deviation</i> makes the organism better able to survive, it passes the change on to its descendants. People are naturally given to change, so there are <i>deviations</i> in critical thought as well as in math and science. Those <i>deviations</i> often account for the creativity that gives rise to new ideas, or theories, or even musical styles.</p></div></div>`;
