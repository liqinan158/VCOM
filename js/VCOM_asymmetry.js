The American flag is an example of <i>asymmetry</i>.</p><p class="long">If you understand symmetry, you're on your way to understanding asymmetry. Symmetry means that the parts of something are equal or match: if both halves of a house look exactly the same, that's an example of symmetry. If the sides are different, that's asymmetry. This concept can apply to relationships too. If one friend is taking advantage of the other, this is an asymmetrical relationship because it's not equal or fair. When you see the word <i>asymmetry</i>, think unequal or unbalanced.</p></div>`;
