But before the lava rises to the earth's surface it's called <i>magma</i>.</p><p class="long">Although <i>lava</i> and <i>magma</i> are often used interchangeably, technically <i>magma</i> is the name for the hot molten rock (mixed with gases and mineral crystals) that collects in chambers beneath the Earth's crust. Once the magma breaks through the Earth's surface and flows down the volcano, you can call it lava. There are about 1500 active volcanoes on the Earth and at least 80 under the oceans â€” which add up to a lot of magma and possible lava.</p></div>`;
