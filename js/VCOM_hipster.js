Instead of following popular trends, <i>hipsters</i> generally favor alternative lifestyles, progressive politics, and quirky clothing.</p><p class="long">The meaning of the word <i>hipster</i> has evolved since it was coined in the early 1940s to describe jazz musicians and fans, from the jazz slang term <i>hep</i>, "up to date." In the 1960s, <i>hipster</i> mainly referred to low-slung, hip-hugging pants, but by the 1990s it described an urban subculture made up mostly of young and educated bohemian types living in gentrified neighborhoods.</p></div></div>`;
