A <i>maritime</i> museum would probably be located in a coastal town, and stuffed full of historic boats, oars, life preservers, and fishing gear.</p><p class="long"><i>Maritime</i> comes from the Latin word <i>maritimus</i>, which means "of the sea," so the meaning hasn't evolved much. Whales and dolphins are maritime animals, and according to maritime law, the captain of a ship can marry two people at sea. It's very similar to <i>nautical</i>, except <i>nautical</i> refers to ships, and <i>maritime</i> covers ships and other ocean-related stuff.</p></div></div>`;
