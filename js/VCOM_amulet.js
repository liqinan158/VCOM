Often found in undeveloped societies — or <i>Brady Bunch</i> episodes — an amulet acts as a charm to protect its wearer from evil. Often worn close to the heart as a necklace, the word <i>amulet</i> can refer to any a piece of jewelry or other trinket that is kept close to the body and believed to keep evil and danger at bay.</p></div>`;
