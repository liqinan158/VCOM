In some places, donkeys are ridden like horses or kept as calming companions for nervous horses. The word <i>donkey</i> was first used as slang for the animal then only called an <i>ass</i>. It was probably modeled after <i>monkey</i>, with which it originally rhymed, from <i>dun</i>, or "a grayish brown color."</p></div></div>`;
