To put it more scientifically, it’s a celestial body of hot gases radiating energy. A <i>star</i> is also a person who dazzles — the <i>star</i> of the show or the <i>star</i> archaeologist.</p><p class="long">If you're starring in a Broadway show, your name gets top billing — you've got the biggest part or maybe you're the best known performer, the actor people are wild to see, the one with the most "<i>star</i> power." If you believe in fate or astrology, you might "thank your lucky <i>stars</i>" for your good fortune. <i>Star</i> is the same root as the Greek <i>aster</i>, as in <i>asterisk</i> — a star symbol.</p></div></div>`;
