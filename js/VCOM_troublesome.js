Your <i>troublesome</i> old car, for example, might be unreliable and have a history of breaking down at the most inconvenient moments.</p><p class="long">Use the adjective <i>troublesome</i> to describe things — or people — that are worrisome or inconvenient. A troublesome stomach virus will keep you home from work, and a troublesome teenager is a constant source of anxiety and frustration for his parents. The word <i>troublesome</i> adds the suffix <i>some</i>, "tending to or causing," to <i>trouble</i>, which has a Latin Latin root, <i>turbidare</i>, "make trouble or make turbid." <i>Turbid</i>, by the way, means "muddy or full of confusion."</p></div>`;
