It will blow your mind. Someone who gives away a million dollars is <i>astonishingly</i> generous.</p><p class="long">To astonish is to amaze, and anything wild and surprising is astonishing. Add an <i>-ly</i> to the end to form <i>astonishingly</i> and that describes something done in a way that completely surprises. Great athletes play astonishingly well, a sunset that takes your breath away is astonishingly beautiful, and someone who suddenly leaps out of a deathbed has astonishingly been cured! This is a strong word for things you can hardly believe are happening.</p></div>`;
