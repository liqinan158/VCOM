Want a raise in your allowance? You may have to agree to do more chores as a <i>concession</i> before your parents will agree.</p><p class="long">Although a <i>concession</i> in an argument is the act of yielding or granting something, don't get confused and think that a <i>concession</i> stand is called that because the workers are granting you popcorn at the baseball stadium. <i>Concessions</i> at a ballpark or at another venue are called that because the stadium has granted the right to sell food to a certain provider. Chew on that the next time you're munching on peanuts at a game.</p></div></div>`;
