Like an alien from outer space. Some people are afraid of illegal aliens from other countries. Besides people, experiences can be alien. If you've never owned a cat, then having a cat is alien to you. You can also <i>alienate</i> people by making them feel weird, disconnected, and alone: like an alien.</p></div>`;
