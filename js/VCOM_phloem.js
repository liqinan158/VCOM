The <i>phloem</i> of trees is located just underneath the bark.</p><p class="long">Phloem is a type of plant tissue that resembles tiny tubes and ensures that every part of the plant — including its seeds, fruit, and roots — receives the sugar made during photosynthesis. Phloem, which is usually just inside the stem or bark, is named for a root word that means "bark." If you tap a maple tree for syrup, you'll drill holes through the bark and into the phloem, allowing the sugars (in the form of syrup) to flow out.</p></div>`;
