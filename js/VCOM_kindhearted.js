When someone loses their home in a fire, their <i>kindhearted</i> neighbors will pitch in to help them.</p><p class="long"><i>Kindhearted</i> is almost a synonym of <i>kind</i>, but it implies an even deeper layer of sympathy and compassion. A truly kindhearted reaction to seeing someone who's lost or in trouble is to stop and help them. It's kindhearted to welcome new people to your community, to give money to someone who needs it, or to offer your subway seat to someone who looks tired. Your very favorite people are probably the ones who are most kindhearted.</p></div>`;
