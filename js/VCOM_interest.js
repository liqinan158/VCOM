You might have an <i>interest</i> in African literature, or you might follow the news with <i>interest</i>.</p><p class="long">Although <i>interest</i> is used mainly to describe anything that is, well, interesting, it also is used in specific legal contexts. If you have an interest in a company, it means you own part of it. <i>Interest</i> is also the word used to describe money charged or given as part of a debt. If a bank loans you $10,000, you have to pay back the $10,000 plus the interest. If the interest rate is 5 percent annually, you would owe $500.</p></div>`;
