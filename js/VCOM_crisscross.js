Your favorite shirt might be printed with pink and purple <i>crisscrosses</i>.</p><p class="long">You might doodle a crisscross pattern during class or stitch crisscrosses on a quilt. You can also use the word as a verb, meaning to cross in a pattern: "The sidewalks <i>crisscross</i> the city," or "I watched the dogs <i>crisscross</i> the beach."  The word dates from the 1800s, from the Middle English <i>crist-cross</i>, or "Christ's cross," which was a mark traditionally made before the alphabet in a schoolbook or primer.</p></div></div>`;
