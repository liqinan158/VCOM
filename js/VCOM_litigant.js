The person who sues and the person who gets sued are both <i>litigants</i>.</p><p class="long">To litigate is to use the legal system, and to be litigious is to be prone to filing lawsuits. <i>Litigant</i> refers to someone who is part of a lawsuit. If you sue a doctor, you’re a litigant, as is the doctor. If your landlord sues you, you’re both litigants. A company can be a litigant too. Litigants require lawyers. In fact, without litigants, lawyers would have nothing to do. Lucky for them, there are many litigants in the world.</p></div></div>`;
