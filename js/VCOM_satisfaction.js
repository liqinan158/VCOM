When a product says "Satisfaction guaranteed" it means you’ll like it or they'll give you your money back. A good meal provides satisfaction of your hunger. When you graduate from school or get a good job, you have a feeling of satisfaction. This term once meant an act of atonement assigned by a priest to make up for a sin. When something is explained well, it was explained to your satisfaction.</p></div></div>`;
