Hikers often follow a well-worn <i>pathway</i> as they walk through the woods.</p><p class="long">Use the noun <i>pathway</i> to mean a walk, path, or trail — any marked way that's meant or used for walking. The pathway you follow on your way to school might lead you over a stream and through a field, or it might meander down a narrow city alley. <i>Pathway</i> is essentially a longer, redundant way to say "path," and in fact it comes from <i>path</i> and its Old English root <i>pæþ</i>, "path or track," which has a Germanic origin.</p></div></div>`;
