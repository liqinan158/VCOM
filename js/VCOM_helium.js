Because <i>helium</i> is lighter than air, it's commonly used for filling balloons to make them float.</p><p class="long">Because of the effect that helium has when lightweight objects are filled with it — making party balloons and parade floats hover in the air as if by magic — it's one of the best-known elements. Helium is almost always a gas, unless it's subjected to very extreme conditions, and it's been used at various times in military airships and weather balloons. The word <i>helium</i> comes from a Greek root, <i>helios</i>, or "sun," because it was initially discovered in the sun's spectrum.</p></div>`;
