Well it's all that, but in 1678 it was a stop in John Bunyan's allegorical story "The Pilgrim's Progress," a never-ending fair in a town called Vanity. After that, "Vanity Fair" was a widely-read novel in the 19th century by William Makepeace Thackeray, the title of several films, and finally the name of both British and American magazines.</p></div>`;
