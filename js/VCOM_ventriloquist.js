Specifically, these performers pretend to make their dolls, puppets, or dummies speak for entertainment purposes.</p><p class="long">The Latin word <i>ventriloquium</i> means “to speak from the stomach.” Ventriloquists have learned the art of projecting their voices, speaking without moving their lips, and moving the mouths of their dummies simultaneously so that it seems like their dummies are talking.
