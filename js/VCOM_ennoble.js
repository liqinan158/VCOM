The Queen of England has the power to <i>ennoble</i> people, turning Paul McCartney into Sir Paul McCartney, for example.</p><p class="long">One way to use the verb <i>ennoble</i> is to mean, literally, "make someone a noble or a member of the nobility." It can also mean "bestow or lend dignity to" or "make dignified." You could say, "Reading great books <i>ennobles</i> the mind," or "Treating others with kindness ennobles a person." <i>Ennoble</i> comes from the Old French <i>ennoblir</i>, from the prefix <i>en-</i>, "put in," and the Latin root <i>nobilis</i>, "excellent, superior, or splendid."</p></div></div>`;
