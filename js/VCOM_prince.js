Originally, a <i>prince</i> was the ruler of and individual territory, also known as “principalities.” A <i>prince</i> is a popular fairy tale hero, but there are real live ones, too.</p><p class="long">A prince is the son of a monarch, possibly even the person who stands to inherit the title of king after his father's death. Sometimes, though, a prince is simply a member of the royal family, or even a ruler over a small area of the monarch's country. <i>Prince</i> comes from the Latin <i>princeps</i>, "first man" or "ruler," from <i>primus</i>, "first." A prince is often first in line to inherit the throne.</p></div>`;
