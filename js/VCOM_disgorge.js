Usually, this somewhat icky word is applied to birds or animals rather than people.</p><p class="long"><i>Gorge</i> is an old-fashioned word for the throat, so to <i>disgorge</i> is to eject something through the throat. (Yuck.) In addition to its literal meaning, <i>disgorge</i> also has the broader metaphorical meaning of "to empty out." So a bus might disgorge its passengers and a spy might disgorge her secrets â€” for the right price.</p></div>`;
