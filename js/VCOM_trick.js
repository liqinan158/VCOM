If you fool people into thinking they're donating to a good cause when you're really keeping their money, you're playing a <i>trick</i> on them. It's not nice to <i>trick</i> people.</p><p class="long">"A mean ruse" is the oldest meaning of <i>trick</i>, which is rooted in the Latin <i>tricari</i>, "be evasive." Today it's also used for less mean-spirited deceptions, including funny practical jokes and a magician's sleight-of-hand illusions, commonly called magic tricks. To trick someone is to fool them, and if you hold a trick in your hand, you're playing bridge, hearts, or another "trick-taking" card game.</p></div></div>`;
