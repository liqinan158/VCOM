A dipsomaniac has a physical need for alcohol that goes beyond being thirsty: itâ€™s an addiction. The <i>dipsa</i> root (meaning "thirst") turns up in a few other somewhat obscure words, such as <i>adipsia</i>(meaning "loss of thirst") and <i>polydipsia</i> (meaning "excessive thirst").</p></div></div>`;
