The catchphrase, in turn, is often rendered as a pun: "He fell of the ladder and broke his foot. He writhed in <i>agony</i> from the pain, but the physical pain, was nothing compared to his mental <i>agony</i> when the doctor setting the bone joked, 'Now you know the <i>agony</i> of de feet!'"</p></div></div>`;
