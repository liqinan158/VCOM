If you were at a concert where the rock star jumped into the audience, the concert (and audience) may have achieved a state of  <i>transcendence</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Transcendence</i> comes from the Latin prefix <i>trans-</i>, meaning "beyond," and the word <i>scandare</i>, meaning "to climb." When you achieve <i>transcendence</i>, you have gone beyond ordinary limitations. The word is often used to describe a spiritual or religious state, or a condition of moving beyond physical needs and realities. One way to achieve <i>transcendence</i> spiritually might be to fast for a long time. If you have trouble letting go of material needs, then you will have a difficult time achieving transcendence.</p></div></div>`;
