Use it to describe terrible things like your neighbor's <i>inhumane</i> treatment of his hound dogs, which he leaves tied up in the yard in all kinds of weather.</p><p class="long">Whenever someone acts without considering the discomfort or pain of another person or animal, you can describe their actions as inhumane. A cruel government that keeps prisoners in terrible conditions is inhumane, and the treatment of farm animals is in some cases revealed to be inhumane by investigators. The word <i>inhumane</i> was originally a synonym of <i>inhuman</i>, literally "not human," but it fell out of use and then was revived in the 1820s to mean the opposite of <i>humane</i>.</p></div>`;
