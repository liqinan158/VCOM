Yuck.</p><p class="long">Natural gum has many uses, including as a thickener in food products. Chewing <i>gum</i>, however, has only one real use: it's made to be chewed but not swallowed. This kind of gum often has a fruity or minty flavor, and can sometimes be blown into bubbles. When you <i>gum</i> something up, you clog or block it â€” or you make it sticky. Completely different <i>gums</i> are the soft flesh inside your mouth where your teeth are rooted.</p></div></div>`;
