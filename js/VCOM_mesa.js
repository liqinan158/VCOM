Its sides are steep all around so that it looks like a massive table.</p><p class="long"><i>Mesa</i> comes from the Latin <i>mensa</i> meaning "table," which is very much what a mesa looks like.  A mesa is formed when the weaker horizontal rocks around a big formation start to erode and fall away, leaving stronger rocks standing in a flat-topped hill.  Grand Mesa in Western Colorado is the largest mesa in the world, with an area of 500 square miles. That's bigger than all of Hong Kong!</p></div>`;
