Asters are perennial plants, so they continue to grow and bloom again year after year. There are hundreds of different varieties of asters, but most of them have small, daisy-like flower heads, almost star shaped â€” which is why the plant is called <i>aster</i>, the Latin word for "star."</p></div></div>`;
