You may be exhausted halfway through running a 10K race, but you'll probably get a <i>second wind</i> before the end.</p><p class="long">The phenomenon of a second wind has been studied by scientists, but there are still different theories about why it happens. Some think it's because of endorphins, natural "feel good" chemicals released by the body, and others believe it's the result of the body balancing oxygen and the lactic acid that builds up in muscles during exertion. You can also use this term to describe what happens when you feel wide awake again after a period of drowsiness.</p></div></div>`;
