Vampires have them, venomous snakes have them... you could have them, too, if your Halloween costume includes a set of pointy teeth.</p><p class="long">The word <i>fang</i> came into English from the Old Norse word <i>fang</i>, meaning “capture, grasp.” It was originally used to describe something that was seized or captured, like loot taken after a battle. Later it meant "something that traps or snares." When you think of a sharp tooth’s ability to snare something, it’s not such a leap to the word’s current meaning: the long, pointy teeth of a predatory animal or a snake — or a vampire.</p></div></div>`;
