It might be something physical, such as plunging your body into water, or metaphorical, such as becoming totally <i>immersed</i> in a project.</p><p class="long">The Latin background of <i>immersion</i> includes the root <i>mergere</i>, "to plunge."  The idea of <i>immersion</i> as a physical submergence came first and the idea of something being absorbed in a situation came about later.  The idea behind <i>immersion</i> is that of complete coverage, whether that be by water, as in Baptism, or by attention, as in "immersion learning," an idea for learning a language trademarked in 1965 by the Berlitz company.</p></div>`;
