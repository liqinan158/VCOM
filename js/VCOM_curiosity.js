If you find a diary in a coffee shop, <i>curiosity</i> will make you want to look inside â€” but respect for the writer's privacy may convince you not to.</p><p class="long"><i>Curiosity</i> is the state of being <i>curious</i>: inquisitive, wondering, ready to poke around and figure something out. The word used to mean "very, very careful," and only in the last few hundred years turned into a word expressing the desire to know more. Maybe that's because when you're poking around in secret business, you need to be very, very careful. We also call weird things <i>curiosities</i>, like a phone shaped like a duck, or a shark in a jar.</p></div></div>`;
