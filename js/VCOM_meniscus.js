You will see the liquid has a slight curve, either up or down. This curved surface, created by air pressure, is called a <i>meniscus</i>.</p><p class="long">The Greeks had a word for the lunar crescent, <i>mēniskos</i>, which itself came from the word for the moon, <i>mḗnē</i>. In the late 17th Century, the word <i>meniscus</i> was given to similarly-curved lenses. Then in 1812, the curved surfaces of liquid were referred to by this word as well. Later, the name was also applied to a crescent-shaped cartilage at the knee, between the tibia and the femur. These small, semi-lunar bits are important for reducing friction during leg movement.</p></div>`;
