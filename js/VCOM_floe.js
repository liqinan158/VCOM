Beware: if you're at the North Pole, you could get stranded on an ice <i>floe</i> along with polar bears and other arctic creatures.</p><p class="long">A floe can vary in size from small to giant, but they differ from icebergs in their relative lack of depth. When you spot an iceberg, it’s often just the tip of what’s there, but with a floe, what you see is what you get. The floe edge is where the ice that is still attached to the land, having frozen over the winter months, meets the sea. When the floe edge fractures, the ice floe floats out to sea.</p></div></div>`;
