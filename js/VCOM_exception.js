The saying ”<i>i</i> before <i>e</i> except after <i>c</i>,” is about an exception to a spelling rule. If you run every day but take Saturdays off, you're making an exception. If your teacher punishes you for being late even though you have an excuse, she might say, "I'm sorry, but I can't make an exception." When you see <i>exception</i>, think "Something different than usual is happening."</p></div></div>`;
