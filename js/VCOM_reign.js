var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">reign</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Rain falls from above, and people who <i>reign</i> rule from a position above others. They reign over countries and governments, and even over businesses and arts, as in "She used to <i>reign</i> over punk music, always topping the charts."</p><p class="long">While <i>reign</i> is a verb when it refers to the actions of a person or group of people, the period of time when they reign is also called a <i>reign,</i> as a noun: "His reign over the rodeo circuit ended when he was tackled by a bull named Princess-Maker." Sometimes a stretch of time is called a <i>reign</i>, even without regard to who was the leader, as in a "<i>reign</i> of peace," or a period of time without war and conflict, in a place or government.</p></div>`;
