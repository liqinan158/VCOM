If the most <i>coveted</i> seat on the bus for you is the one right next to the bathroom, then you shouldn’t have any problem getting it because most people don't want it.</p><p class="long"><i>Coveted</i> comes from the Latin <i>cupiditas</i>, meaning “passionate desire, eagerness, ambition.” Cupid isn't always involved, though — <i>coveted</i> is another way of saying "sought after." The poet Ella Wheeler Wilcox said, “If you are seeking health, wealth, usefulness, skill in any direction, there is nothing and no one who can hinder your attainment of the <i>coveted</i> boon, if you are willing to work and wait." So get to work for all that coveted health and wealth!</p></div></div>`;
