More generally, we think of a <i>noun</i> as a person, place, thing, quality, or action.</p><p class="long">The word <i>noun</i> is noun, since a word is a thing. Tricky examples of nouns include gerunds: <i>studying</i> looks like a verb (and it is when you say "I'm studying for a test") but it's often a noun instead, as when you say, "Studying is very important." Sometimes a noun is missing but implied: When you tell your friend to "Go jump in a lake," the noun is <i>you,</i> as in "Hey, you, go jump in a lake."</p></div>`;
