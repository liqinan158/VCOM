Who wouldn't like to imagine cows without a care, contented and grazing in sunny, green pastures, every now and then emitting a satisfied moo? The company, which is still in business, became known by that slogan, which they used for many years. They even sponsored a radio show called "The <i>Contented</i> Hour," broadcast from 1931 until 1951.</p></div>`;
