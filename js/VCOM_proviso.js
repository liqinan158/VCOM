You might agree to buy a used car with a <i>proviso</i> that the fuzzy steering-wheel cover is included as part of the sale.</p><p class="long"><i>Proviso</i> looks a lot like the words "provide" and "provision," and it goes back to the Latin verb <i>providēre,</i> "foresee, provide." <i>Proviso</i> often implies that there are conditions to getting something, as when you agree to take your younger brother to the movies with you, provided — with the <i>proviso</i> — that you get popcorn and an 82-ounce soft drink. Most parents would agree, with the <i>proviso</i> that the drink be no more than 20 ounces. Agreed?</p></div></div>`;
