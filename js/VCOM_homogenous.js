It used to only mean people who had the same ancestors, but in English we use it for anything that is characterized by sameness. You might live in a homogenous neighborhood, where everyone makes the same amount of money and drives the same kind of car. The opposite of <i>homogenous</i> is <i>heterogenous</i>, which means "many kinds."</p></div></div>`;
