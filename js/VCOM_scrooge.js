Scrooge, the chief character from <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, is perhaps the best-known of them all. Like the character, a scrooge is a selfish person who doesn't like giving or spending. Scrooges keep a tight hold on every penny, even if theyâ€™re rich. You can also call a scrooge a miser or skinflint. Someone generous is the opposite of a scrooge.</p></div>`;
