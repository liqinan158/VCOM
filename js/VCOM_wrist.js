Without your <i>wrists</i>, it would be hard to play tennis â€” or even to wave goodbye to your friends.</p><p class="long">The wrist is a complicated joint that allows you to bend and rotate your hand in many different directions. The entire wrist area includes so many bones, muscles, tendons, and ligaments that it's fairly easy to injure. Carpal tunnel syndrome is one common injury that's caused by repeated motion of the wrist. The word <i>wrist</i> stems from the German <i>Rist</i>, "back of the hand," and a root meaning "to turn or bend."</p></div>`;
