If your new recipe for chocolate cupcakes is met by enthusiastic cheers, you can assume you have an <i>unmitigated</i> success on your hands.</p><p class="long"><i>Unmitigated</i> comes from the Latin roots <i>un-</i>, meaning "not," and <i>mitigare</i>, meaning "made mild, soft, or gentle." Perhaps because of these origins, although <i>unmitigated</i> can be used positively, as in unmitigated success, but the word is often paired more negatively. You knew the wedding was going to be an unmitigated disaster when the bride and groom didn't bother to show up at all, leaving the guests to sit waiting for hours.</p></div></div>`;
