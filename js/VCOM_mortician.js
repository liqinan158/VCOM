Not too many want to be <i>morticians</i>, which makes sense: a <i>mortician</i> runs a funeral home.</p><p class="long">One of the saddest facts of life is that we all die, but that fact is a little less sad if you're a mortician — their business depends on death. Morticians — also called undertakers and funeral directors — do various jobs, such as planning a funeral, helping people pick a coffin, and preparing the body of the person who died. Morticians also need to be skilled at comforting, because they are constantly working with people who are sad and angry at the death of their family or friends.</p></div></div>`;
