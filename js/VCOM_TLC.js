When you're sick in bed with the flu you might need soup, tea, tissues â€” and some <i>TLC</i>.</p><p class="long">The acronym <i>TLC</i> was first used in print around 1953. Some accounts attribute its first use to nursing care in hospitals, but the history isn't clear. That would make sense, though, since sick people don't need just medicine, but also TLC to thrive. You can provide TLC to a friend who's grieving or a pet nearing the end of its life, just by being there for them.</p></div></div>`;
