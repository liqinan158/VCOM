A <i>short-term</i> romance might be for a few weeks instead of a lifetime, and a <i>short-term</i> job won't provide you long-term security.</p><p class="long">The word <i>term</i> often applies to units of time, like a politician's term in office. This word has to do with time, but only small amounts of time: anything short-term occurs for a little while, and then it's over. A short-term illness goes away quickly, and a short-term problem won't weigh you down for long. The opposite of <i>short-term</i> is <i>long-term</i>, which refers to things happening for a greater period of time.</p></div></div>`;
