If you live in a harbor town, you can walk down the <i>marina</i> to watch boats come and go.</p><p class="long">A <i>marina</i> differs from a port, which is also a harbor where boats can dock, because it's designed for small boats and yachts, rather than large ships. Seaside towns and cities often have public marinas for mooring boats, and private yacht clubs also have marinas. The word <i>marine</i>, which means "pertaining to the sea," can help you remember that a marina is a place where boats dock. The Latin root of both is <i>mare</i>, "the sea."</p></div>`;
