If you agree to keep someone's secret, you could tell them, "<i>Mum</i>'s the word!"</p><p class="long">A shy child who's new at school might stay mum all day, and even your most talkative friend might remain mum on controversial topics like religion and politics. In many parts of the world, <i>mum</i> is also a nickname for your mother â€” and it's also a nickname for the flower called a chrysanthemum. The "quiet" meaning of <i>mum</i> comes from Old English, inspired by the "mmm" sound you make when your lips are closed.</p></div>`;
