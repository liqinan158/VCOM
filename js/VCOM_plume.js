Going back further, we can find the Latin <i>pluma</i> meaning "feather" or "down."  <i>Plume</i> is often applied to a large puff of smoke or any mass that spreads into the air from a single source.  If you see a plume of smoke coming from the chimney, the fireplace is going.  If you see a plume of smoke coming from the window, call the fire department.</p></div>`;
