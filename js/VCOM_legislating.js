Everyone thinks they know how to govern a state or the country. If you are a lawmaker, you are probably tempted a million times a day to say, "Leave the <i>legislating</i> to people who know what they are doing!"</p><p class="long"><i>Legislating</i> has <i>legislate</i> as its base word. Both words are related to <i>legislation</i>, which has at its roots the Latin word <i>lex</i>, meaning "law." If you are constantly talking to your constituents, people may begin to wonder when you have time to do the legislating that needs to be done. However, if you don't talk to your constituents, the people are sure to say you are out of touch!</p></div>`;
