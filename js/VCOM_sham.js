If you frequently order products advertised on late-night, hour-long television commercials, you’ve probably ended up with at least one item that was a <i>sham</i>. All-purpose, industrial strength stain remover, anyone?</p><p class="long"><i>Sham</i> can be used to refer to people as well as to things. Remember that doctor from the late-night TV commercial advertising UltraMiracleCure vitamin pills? He’s probably a sham, or a quack. Some sources claim that the word <i>sham</i> originated in the 17th century and was derived from the English word <i>shame</i>, but who knows? Maybe that theory’s a sham too.</p></div></div>`;
