The verb <i>burble</i> captures both the movement of the water and the sound it makes as it moves. You could also say that a brook or stream or river <i>babbles</i> or <i>ripples</i> or even <i>trickles</i>. The word <i>burble</i> was first used in the 1300's, and it probably comes from an imitation of the sound a rippling, bubbling brook makes.</p></div>`;
