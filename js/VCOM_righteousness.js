As you can tell from seeing the word <i>right</i>, this is a word about taking a stand and doing the right thing. Trying to help poor, oppressed people is a cause full of righteousness. Doing an unpopular thing that is ethical requires righteousness. People like Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela definitely walked the path of righteousness.</p></div></div>`;
