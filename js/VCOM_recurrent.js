If so, you could say that you have a <i>recurrent</i> dream of flight. <i>Recurrent</i> means something that happens repeatedly.</p><p class="long">The word <i>recurrent</i> comes from a Latin word meaning "to return or come back." A recurrent dream, good or bad, keeps coming back. You'll hear this word used often about abstract things like dreams, thoughts, and in literature, themes. For instance, the theme of a motherless child finding its way in the world is recurrent in pop culture and literature.</p></div></div>`;
