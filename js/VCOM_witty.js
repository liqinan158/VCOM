When you make such a remark, you are also considered to be <i>witty.</i></p><p class="long">The adjective <i>witty</i> can be used to describe those quick little funny remarks that often demonstrate a sharp, biting humor delivered in a playful manner. <i>Witty</i> usually describes things that are off-the-cuff amusing, rather than remarks that are elaborate or carefully planned in advance. This adjective is usually used in a complimentary way, but, like its cousin <i>clever,</i> it can be used sarcastically, as when someone who doesn't appreciate your one-liners says, "Well, aren't we witty today."</p></div>`;
