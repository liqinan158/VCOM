A child's pediatrician can <i>immunize</i> her against measles, polio, and mumps, among many other illnesses.</p><p class="long">Vaccines work by arming your immune system against being infected â€” in other words, they produce immunity, or immunize you. In some cases, being exposed to a disease can also immunize you; if you've had chicken pox, you are most likely immune to it and won't get it again. There is also a legal meaning of <i>immunize</i>, "To make legally <i>immune</i>," or "to protect from being prosecuted in court." The Latin root, <i>immunis</i>, means "exempt" or "free."</p></div></div>`;
