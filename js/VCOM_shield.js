If you carry a <i>shield</i> you might be a knight, or a traffic cop who likes to flash the badge.</p><p class="long">Ancestors of the word <i>shield</i> include the Old English <i>scild</i>, similar to <i>sciell</i>, or "shell," which suggests the meaning of the word. If you're a turtle, you might use your shell as a shield.  But a shield doesn't have to be something physical. Philosopher Soren Kierkegaard once said, "Love is my sword, goodness my armor, and humor my shield." The word can also be used as a verb.  You might shield your tender ears from hearing naughty words.  Don't worry, <i>shield</i> is perfectly safe.</p></div></div>`;
