On a clear summer day, you might see several <i>contrails</i> criss-crossing the blue sky.</p><p class="long">The next time you see the elongated, cloud-like lines in the sky that linger long after the plane that made them has disappeared, you'll know to call them <i>contrails</i>. They're caused by condensing water vapor from an airplane's exhaust. The word dates from 1945, a shortened version of "condensation trail," and they're sometimes also called "vapor trails."</p></div></div>`;
