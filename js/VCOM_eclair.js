You might think of an <i>eclair</i> as a fancy donut — although Parisians might disagree with you.</p><p class="long">The French <i>éclair</i> means "flash of lightning," and the scrumptious pastry got its name from the tendency people have to eat eclairs "in a flash." The 19th century <i>Chambers Dictionary</i> famously defined the eclair as "a cake, long in shape but short in duration." An eclair is like a stretched-out cream puff, choux dough baked and filled with creamy custard. Try one and see how long it lasts.</p></div>`;
