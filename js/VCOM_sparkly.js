When people are described as sparkly, it's usually because they are vivacious and enthusiastic, the life of the party. The word <i>sparkly</i> was first used in the 1920s, from <i>sparkle</i>, which in turn comes from <i>spark</i>. The origin isn't known for sure, but it may be rooted in the Old Norse word <i>sparkr</i>, "sprightly."</p></div>`;
