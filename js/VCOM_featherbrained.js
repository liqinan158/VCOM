Your ditzy friend who's always giggling might be a little <i>featherbrained</i>.</p><p class="long">If you're featherbrained, you're not too smart or serious — in fact, you're probably foolish and a little simple. It isn't a very complimentary thing to call someone <i>featherbrained</i>, since being described this way is always at least a little insulting. The implication is that a featherbrained person's head is full of something insubstantial — as light and fluffy as feathers — rather than a brain.</p></div></div>`;
