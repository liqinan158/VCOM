var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">oscitant</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Someone who's <i>oscitant</i> is visibly bored and distracted. A classroom full of <i>oscitant</i> students can be extremely discouraging to a brand new teacher.</p><p class="long">When someone isn't paying attention to you — yawning while you speak, watching the clock, or sighing deeply — you can describe them as <i>oscitant</i>. It's a useful adjective, but a very rare one — you're more likely to read it in an old book than to actually hear someone use it. <i>Oscitant</i> comes from the Latin word <i>oscitans</i>, "sluggish or lazy," which stems from <i>oscitare</i>, "to yawn," and <i>os citare</i>, "to move the mouth."</p></div></div>`;
