It's especially common for very young babies to suffer from <i>colic</i>, much to the frustration of their exhausted parents.</p><p class="long">Baby or infantile colic is the most commonly known form of this condition, although its exact cause isn't understood by doctors. When babies spend a lot of time crying and tensing their bodies, they're often diagnosed with colic, believed to be intestinal cramps caused by gas. Sharp pain in an adult's kidneys or gallbladder is also known as colic, as is a very serious condition in horses, in which their intestines become twisted and blocked.</p></div></div>`;
