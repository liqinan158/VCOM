German shepherds are much more <i>lupine</i> than pugs are.</p><p class="long">A lupine person, animal, or thing shares some of the characteristics of a wolf. You might describe your brother's sharp-toothed smile as slightly lupine, worry about your sister's lupine habit of howling at the full moon, or admire your dog's noble lupine profile. The adjective <i>lupine</i> comes from the French word of the same name, with Latin roots: <i>lupinus<i>, "of the wolf," from <i>lupus</i>, "wolf."</i></i></p></div></div>`;
