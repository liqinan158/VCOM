An audience's standing ovation might <i>aptly</i> capture its enthusiasm for a rock band's energetic performance.</p><p class="long">First used in the mid-14th century, the adverb <i>aptly</i>, by way of the adjective <i>apt</i>, "appropriate or suitable," comes from the Latin word <i>aptus</i>, meaning "fit or suited." A dog called Snoozy who lies around on the couch all day is aptly named, and a newspaper obituary that perfectly sums up your grandfather's life aptly captures who he really was. In both examples, something is utterly suited or appropriate.</p></div>`;
