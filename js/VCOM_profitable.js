Businesses hope to be <i>profitable</i> in the financial sense, but a <i>profitable</i> relationship is one that's good for everyone involved.</p><p class="long"><i>Profitable</i> started out as a word to describe anything useful, but it hooked up with finance in the mid-1700s. Profits are measured in money earned beyond expenses, so profitable businesses or transactions make money. A busy restaurant, sold-out concert, and best-selling book are all profitable. People also use this word for situations that are good in ways that donâ€™t involve money. If you learned a lot from something, then it was a profitable experience, even if you didn't make any cash.</p></div>`;
