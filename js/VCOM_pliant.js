"The teenager showed off her <i>pliant</i> spine every time she draped herself over a piece of furniture. Why hanging upside down off the sofa didn't give her a headache, her mother would never know."</p><p class="long"><i>Pliant</i> has both a literal and a figurative meaning. <i>Pliant</i> can describe something that is bendable — like a spine, a tree branch, a bendy straw — or it can describe something that is flexible, but less tangible. In this latter sense, <i>pliant</i> describes something that adjusts to conditions or is easily influenced: "In order to survive the recession, the company had to be <i>pliant</i> and adjust to the new economic conditions."</p></div></div>`;
