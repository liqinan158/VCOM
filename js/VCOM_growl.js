Growls are low, rumbling snarls, and they usually mean "Back off!" Dogs growl at people and animals they don’t like. Sometimes people growl when they speak in a low, angry way. If you dine at a restaurant but don’t leave a tip, the waiter might growl at you. Growling is best done though clinched teeth. If an animal or person is growling, stay away!</p></div></div>`;
