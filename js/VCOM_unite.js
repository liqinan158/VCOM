This happened in 1990 when East Germany and West Germany merged into one united Germany. If several people act as one, joining for a common goal, they also unite. The word has been used in English since the fifteenth century, and it came from the Latin <i>unitus</i>, "to unite," which in turn has its roots in <i>unus</i>, which means "one."</p></div></div>`;
