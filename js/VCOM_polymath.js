If your friend is not only a brilliant physics student but has also published a poetry collection and won prizes at political debates, you can describe her as a <i>polymath</i>.</p><p class="long">You can think of a polymath as a classic "Renaissance man." Imagine Leonardo da Vinci, for example, who was not only an amazing artist, but also an engineer, inventor, mathematician, and much more. When a person's knowledge covers many different areas, he or she is a polymath. The Greek word for it is <i>polymathes</i>, "having learned much," with <i>poly</i> meaning "much," and <i>manthanein</i> meaning "learn."</p></div>`;
