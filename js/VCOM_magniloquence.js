When someone uses more words than are necessary to get her point across, especially if her tone is pompous or grandiose, she is guilty of magniloquence. The word comes from the Latin <i>magniloquus</i>, "pompous in talk," which combines <i>magnus</i>, "great," and <i>loquus</i>, "speaking."</p></div>`;
