If you trivialize your own health concerns, other people might not realize how sick you're feeling. When you trivialize an issue, you make it look more trivial than it is, or less significant. The Latin root of both <i>trivialize</i> and <i>trivial</i> is <i>trivialis</i>, "common, commonplace, or vulgar."</p></div></div>`;
