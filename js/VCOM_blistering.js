You can also use <i>blistering</i> to mean a different kind of heat: "Her <i>blistering</i> criticism took him by surprise." Or a racer might set out on a track at a blistering pace, one that's incredibly fast or impressive. The original, hot meaning of <i>blistering</i> comes from the idea that something is "hot enough to form blisters."</p></div>`;
