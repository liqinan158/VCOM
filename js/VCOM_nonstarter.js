A baseball player who strikes out every single time he's up at bat is a <i>nonstarter</i>.</p><p class="long">A political candidate who loses every election is a nonstarter, and an entrepreneur whose businesses keep failing is also a nonstarter. You can also use this word to describe a plan or idea that's just never going to work: "I can see why you'd want to bring your pony to school, but I think it's a <i>nonstarter</i>." The original meaning of <i>nonstarter</i> was a horse unable to run in a race at the last minute.</p></div>`;
