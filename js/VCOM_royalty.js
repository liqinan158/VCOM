If you are in the music business, you may expect a payment, or <i>royalty</i> every time your song is played. How's that for royal treatment?</p><p class="long">The noun <i>royalty</i> means a group of royals, or kings and their extended families. Queen Elizabeth of England is a member of Britain's royalty, for example. You can also use <i>royalty</i> to describe the payment a  writer receives whenever her book is sold, or that a musician gets when his song is played in a grocery store. The word comes from the Latin <i>regalis</i>, "regal," which in turn comes from <i>rex</i>, "king."</p></div>`;
