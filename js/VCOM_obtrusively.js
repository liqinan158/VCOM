You could describe your brother's enormous television as stretching <i>obtrusively</i> across his entire living room wall, for example.</p><p class="long">Something is done obtrusively when in gets in the way or is glaringly obvious. Cell phone towers often loom obtrusively above fields and forests, and annoying people tend to talk obtrusively throughout movies. <i>Obtrusively</i> comes from the adjective <i>obtrusive</i>, which in turn is rooted in the Latin word <i>obtrudere</i>, "to thrust upon or to press into," from <i>ob</i>, "toward," and <i>trudere</i>, "to thrust."</p></div></div>`;
