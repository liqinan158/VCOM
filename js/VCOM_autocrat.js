Hitler and Stalin were historic autocrats. In more recent times, dictators such as Saddam Hussein and Qaddafi were autocrats. From <i>autocrat</i>, we get the word <i>autocratic</i>, for anyone behaving like a dictator. Unfortunately, through history, there have been many autocrats: leaders who didn't give their people a say in their regime and killed their enemies. You might call your boss, parent, or teacher an autocrat, but that's probably an exaggeration.</p></div>`;
