Although they are furry and some people keep them as pets, you probably don't want to cuddle up to one.</p><p class="long">Tarantulas are found primarily in subtropical South America. Their leg spans can range from three to twelve inches, which means that a very big tarantula is about as wide as a cowboy hat! While their bites are poisonous, you won't die from tarantula venom, unless the bite gets infected.</p></div>`;
