If you are shy, you might try to stay in the <i>background</i> at parties and avoid attention.</p><p class="long">The original idea of <i>background</i> was the use of stage scenery or painted drops that established a play's setting. Later, the idea expanded to include the figurative meaning of something that was present yet not immediately noticed, such as the background music in a movie. It also came to mean material that happened earlier and contributed to something.  If your new boss does a "background check" on you, it's because she wants to know all the trouble you've caused in the past.</p></div></div>`;
