If your friend shoves you in front of him when a growling dog approaches, you'd quickly recognize him for the <i>recreant</i> that he is. And in the future youâ€™d choose your friends more carefully.</p><p class="long">An extreme recreant would be the soldier who goes over to the enemy if it looks like they might win. Definitely not the kind of person you'd want in your platoon. <i>Recreant</i> (RE-cree-unt) comes from the Latin <i>re-,</i> meaning to "reverse" something, and <i>credere,</i> "entrust." The word <i>miscreant</i> is nearly synonymous, although a miscreant is not so much a coward, but just an all-around bad sort.</p></div></div>`;
