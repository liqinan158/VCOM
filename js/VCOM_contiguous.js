You can use this adjective to describe people or things related to and nearby others. It comes from the Latin word <i>contiguus</i>, which means pretty much the same thing, "bordering upon." Because the word has two meanings that are very similar but not always the same it can be a bit confusing. This is an example of what's called "semantic ambiguity," when something can mean more than one thing or a word or phrase is not precise.</p></div>`;
