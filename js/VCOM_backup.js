A brand new doctor might need some <i>backup</i> in the emergency room for the first few weeks.</p><p class="long">Use the noun <i>backup</i> when you talk about extra assistance or help. Police officers call for backup when they're not sure they can handle a situation on their own, and store cashiers need backup when things get busy and customers start lining up.
