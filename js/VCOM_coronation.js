Other almost identical terms are <i>enthronement</i> and <i>investiture.</i> The term <i>coronation</i> is also sometimes used in a light-hearted, though sometimes sarcastic way, to describe the ascension of famous non-royal people who have achieved a particular level of public status â€” such as pop stars, politicians or celebrities. <i>Coronation</i> is derived from the Latin word <i>corona</i>, meaning "crown."</p></div>`;
