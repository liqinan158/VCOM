Nowadays, a <i>typist</i> typically uses a computer keyboard.</p><p class="long">Once upon a time, typists did all their typing on typewriters, but that's extremely unusual in today's era of computers and printers. Starting around 1884, a typist was "a person who operates a typewriter," although earlier the word meant "compositer," or the person who arranges type in a printing press. <i>Typist</i> comes from <i>type</i>, which derives from the Greek root <i>typos</i>, "dent, impression, or mark."</p></div>`;
