It's much easier to fly a kite on a <i>blustery</i> day than when there's no wind at all.</p><p class="long">While this word is frequently used for weather — think blustery October days with leaves blowing and people clutching their hats — it can also describe people who act aggressively or confidently but don't follow through. All that blustery talk about your football team's superiority won't mean a thing when they lose badly yet again. The source of <i>blustery</i> is the noun <i>bluster</i>, "loud or indignant talk with little effect," from a Germanic root meaning "blow violently."</p></div></div>`;
