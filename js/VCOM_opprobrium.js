Bad behavior leads to <i>opprobrium</i>. If you throw a soft drink off the theater balcony, the <i>opprobrium</i> might keep you from getting dates to the movies.</p><p class="long">Even though the words aren't related, the "opp-" of the word <i>opprobrium</i> sounds a bit like the "app" part of "inappropriate." Opprobrium isn't an action that leads to disgrace, it's something that comes from the inappropriate thing that was done. A very inappropriate act leads to opprobrium for the person who did the act. "Infamy" — extreme dishonor, often with lasting consequences — is a synonym for <i>opprobrium</i>.</p></div>`;
