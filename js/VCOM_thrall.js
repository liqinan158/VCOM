If you're being held as a hostage, you're in <i>thrall</i> to your captor.</p><p class="long">You can be in thrall to anything that holds you captive or controls your thoughts or actions, like an addiction, a disease, or a cult leader. The Old English word that <i>thrall</i> comes from literally means "slave" or "servant." Another word with the same root as <i>thrall</i> is <i>enthrall</i>, which is sort of a friendlier version of the same idea. If you're enthralled by someone, you're captivated or fascinated, rather than "held in bondage."</p></div>`;
