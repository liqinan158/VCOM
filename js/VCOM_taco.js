Traditional <i>tacos</i> are usually made with spicy, seasoned meat and garnishes like salsa and avocado â€” but these days, people put all kinds of things in tacos.</p><p class="long">Tacos were invented in Mexico before the Spanish arrived. In Mexican Spanish, <i>taco</i> means "light meal," but also "wedge" or "plug." Experts have made guesses about the indigenous roots of <i>taco</i> (like the  Nahuatl word <i>tlahco</i>, "half" or "in the middle"), but this connection hasn't been proven. Today when you order a taco, it might come on a soft or crunchy fried tortilla, and be filled with meat, fish, vegetables, beans, cheese, or even tofu.</p></div></div>`;
