You might hear the <i>muffled</i> sound of your neighbors laughing through the wall of your apartment.</p><p class="long">If you don't want your brother to hear you cry after you finish a sad book, you might put your covers over your head, so all he'll hear is muffled sobs. And if your math class is giggling at your teacher's strange outfit, your hands over your mouths will produce muffled laughter. <i>Muffled</i> comes from <i>muffle</i>, "to cover," which probably stems from the Middle French <i>mofler</i>, "to stuff," and the Old French <i>moufle</i>, "muff or glove."</p></div></div>`;
