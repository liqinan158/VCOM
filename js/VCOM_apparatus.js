For example, the <i>apparatus</i> used for scuba diving includes goggles, flippers, and a breathing tank, while a surgeon’s <i>apparatus</i> includes various scalpels and clamps. Different activities, different <i>apparatuses</i>.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>apparatus</i> evolved from the Latin <i>apparātus</i>, meaning "equipment or preparation." It might refer to one item, (a breathing apparatus) or a group of items (sports apparatus). Here’s a spelling tip: often, when a word ends in <i>-us</i>, the plural ending changes to <i>i</i> — “alumnus/alumni,” “focus/foci.” However, apparatus is part of the group that doesn't change — words like “virus/viruses” or “census/censuses.” This means the plural is either <i>apparatus</i> or <i>apparatuses</i>, though the latter is more common.</p></div>`;
