Some artists also use <i>lithography</i> to print images.</p><p class="long">Unlike other forms of printmaking that involve carving a plate or block that's then coated with ink, in lithography the metal or stone plate is coated with a waxy material. Text or images are carved out of this coating and spread with an oily ink that only adheres to the coated surface. Maps, prints, newspapers, and many other items (often with both images and text) are printed this way. <i>Lithography</i> combines the Greek <i>lithos</i>, "stone," and <i>graphein</i>, "to write."</p></div>`;
