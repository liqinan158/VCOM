If you are driving in a blizzard, you may kick yourself for making such a <i>perilous</i> journey.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>perilous</i> comes from the Latin word <i>periculum</i>, meaning dangerous. Words from the same root include <i>peril</i>, a noun meaning a dangerous situation, and <i>imperil</i>, a verb meaning to put in danger. The last thing you want to do as a parent is to imperil your children. Unfortunately, childhood is filled with peril â€” from climbing on the monkey bars to eating paste, dirt, or bugs. If you think you can prevent all perilous situations, you haven't been a parent very long!</p></div>`;
