If you have a really intense crush on someone, but closer contact reveals that she smells funny in a bad way, you'll probably experience an <i>attenuation</i> of your romantic sensation.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>attenuation</i> comes from the Latin verb meaning "make thin," but it's not just the bodies of hopeful models and ballerinas that undergo attenuation. Any instance of something becoming weaker or smaller could be an attenuation, like the attenuation of a radio signal as you drive out of town, the attenuation of your attention during a boring lecture, or the attenuation of your bank balance after a sudden, impulsive trip to Hawaii.</p></div></div>`;
