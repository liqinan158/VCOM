If you see a <i>spectre</i> of the previous owners in your new house, get out quick! A <i>spectre</i> can also be a thought that haunts you.</p><p class="long">The word <i>spectre</i> (or <i>specter</i>) has to do with being haunted â€” it can be something that literally haunts you, like the ghost of your Aunt Sally who bangs the windows every night. You can also say that a reminder of something painful is a spectre. A spectre can also be a fear of something dreadful happening in the future, like the spectre of a second ice age. <i>Spectre</i> is generally the British spelling, while Americans prefer <i>specter</i>.</p></div>`;
