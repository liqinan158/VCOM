Helpful, right? No? Let's break it down. In both words you see the word <i>tract</i>. A <i>contract</i> is a written document that explains how a legal situation is to be managed together. When someone is <i>tractable</i> they are able to be managed or handled. When they are <i>intractable</i>, they are as unmanageable as a hungry two-year old.</p></div>`;
