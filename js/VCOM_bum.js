var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">bum</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Your <i>bum</i> is your bottom, your rear-end, your behind. It can also be a vagrant or hobo, as well as a verb for lazing (<i>bumming</i>) around.</p><p class="long">Bum is a name given to a beggar or homeless person: someone who tries to bum change from you. You don't have to be a bum to hum a cigarette from someone. Also, <i>bum</i> is a general insult, as in "The Yankees are bums!"  A false accusation is a bum rap. If you remember that your <i>bum</i> is your <i>butt</i> — where you sit when you're being lazy — then the different meanings should fit together well.</p></div>`;
