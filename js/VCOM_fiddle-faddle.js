If you're trying to discuss something serious, and someone makes an irrelevant point, you could say "That's <i>fiddle-faddle</i>!" This is a reduplicative word — like hocus pocus and higgledy-piggledy — which means most of the word repeats. Lots of reduplicative words mean nonsense, such as mumbo-jumbo and jibber-jabber.</p></div>`;
