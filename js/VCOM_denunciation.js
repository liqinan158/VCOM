If you get caught skipping school, expect <i>denunciation</i> â€” by teachers, your principal, parents and maybe even your friends.</p><p class="long">When you harshly criticize someone or something in front of other people, it's a denunciation, like an opinion piece that appears in a newspaper. Sometimes <i>denunciation</i> has the meaning of telling on or exposing someone's misdeeds, like a juicy, book-length denunciation of a famous guitarist written by a former bandmate. The Latin root word is <i>denuntiare</i>, "to announce, proclaim, denounce, or command."</p></div>`;
