If you see someone calling a colorful bird "Polly" and asking it if it wants a cracker, that's a <i>parrot</i>.</p><p class="long">Parrots are popular pets because many of them have the ability to mimic sounds they hear, sometimes including human speech. In fact, this skill has led to a secondary meaning of the word <i>parrot</i>, "mimic mindlessly." You could say, for example, "I'm not going to just <i>parrot</i> everything the teacher says â€” I'm no <i>parrot</i>." The origin of the word is uncertain, although we know that before <i>parrot</i>, this bird was called a <i>popinjay</i>.</p></div></div>`;
