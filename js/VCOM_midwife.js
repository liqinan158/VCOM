Some pregnant women get their prenatal care from a <i>midwife</i>, as well as delivering their babies with a <i>midwife's</i> help.</p><p class="long">There are different categories of midwives â€” lay midwives attend home births, and nurse midwives also assist birthing women at hospitals and birth centers. In either case, a midwife is trained to understand the process of birth and techniques to make it easier and safe for mothers and newborn babies. <i>Midwife</i> literally means "woman who is with," or "woman assisting," from the Middle English <i>mid</i>, "with," and <i>wif</i>, "woman."</p></div>`;
