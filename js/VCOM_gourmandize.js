A good place for people who <i>gourmandize</i> is an all-you-can-eat buffet.</p><p class="long">There are other words with a similar meaning, including <i>binge</i> and <i>overeat</i>. The word <i>gourmandize</i> is a fancier way to essentially say the same thing, although it sometimes implies higher-quality food, like when people gourmandize at expensive restaurants, ordering course after course. No matter what you eat, though, when you gourmandize, you eat too much of it. The word comes from <i>gourmand</i>, "glutton."</p></div></div>`;
