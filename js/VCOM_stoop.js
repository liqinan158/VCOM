If you're six feet tall and you tour a historical building, you'll have to <i>stoop</i> to get through the low doorways.</p><p class="long"><i>Stoop</i> comes from the same root as <i>steep</i>. You can stoop to clear a doorway, or stoop metaphorically, by lower your morals. If you used to be an honest garbageman but now haul "garbage" for the mafia, you have "stooped to their level." If you slouch and droop, you're stooping. When owls quickly descend on their prey, that's also called stooping. <i>Stoop</i> is also the term for the stairs leading up to a front entrance of a house.</p></div>`;
