Santa Claus is an example of a <i>jowly</i> gentleman.</p><p class="long">A heavy, older face is sometimes a bit jowly, with flesh that is settled and drooping around the jaw line and chin. It's not complimentary to describe someone as jowly, but it can be accurate. This adjective comes from <i>jowl</i>, "fold of flesh under the jawbone," from the Middle English <i>cholle</i>, "flesh hanging from the neck or chin," which shares a root with the Old English word for "chin."</p></div></div>`;
