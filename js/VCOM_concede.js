But another meaning of <i>concede</i> is to give away or grant something, as when an unpopular leader is unwilling to concede power. <i>Concede</i> is from Latin <i>concēdere,</i> from the prefix <i>com-</i>, "completely," plus <i>cēdere</i>, "to go along, grant, yield." The corresponding noun is <i>concession</i>.</p></div>`;
