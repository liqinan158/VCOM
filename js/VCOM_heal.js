You'll need to wait until your blisters <i>heal</i> before you put your hiking boots back on and climb Mt. Everest.</p><p class="long">They say time can heal, or cure, a broken heart, while you can be sure that rest, an ice pack, and propping your foot up will heal your twisted ankle. The Proto-Germanic word <i>khailaz</i>, which means "to make whole" is the root of both <i>heal</i> and the closely related word <i>health</i>. Don't confuse <i>heal</i> with <i>heel</i>, which is the back part of your foot or the command that makes a dog stop.</p></div></div>`;
