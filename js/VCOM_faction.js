A <i>faction</i> might take a fraction of the people from a large group and start a new group.</p><p class="long">The Latin source of the word <i>faction</i> means to "do" or "make," though a faction can seem to be a taking away or un-doing. Politics is one area where <i>faction</i> gets a lot of use, because a political party often starts with a large group but has some members who disagree with a belief or direction. These members separate from the larger party and become a faction of their own, with many of the same beliefs as the original group but with a few new differences, too.</p></div></div>`;
