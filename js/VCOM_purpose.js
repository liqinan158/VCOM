The <i>purpose</i> of a fork, for instance, is to spear and scoop food from your plate, not to poke your little brother at the dinner table. <i>Purpose</i> can also be used as a verb meaning "to reach a decision" or "to intend," though these uses of the word are quite a bit less frequent nowadays.</p></div>`;
