Do you need a new suit for your uncle's wedding? You should buy one from the <i>haberdasher</i> downtown.</p><p class="long">The person who owns or operates a <i>haberdashery</i>, or men's clothing store, is a haberdasher. Both terms are considered old-fashioned these days, although fancy shops still use these terms sometimes. In the UK, if you ask someone to recommend a haberdasher, you'll end up at a store that sells sewing notions like pins, needles, buttons, and so on. In the U.S., the original meaning of <i>haberdasher</i> was a "seller of men's caps."</p></div></div>`;
