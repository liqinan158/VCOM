If you're a budding paleontologist, you might want to visit the Museum of Natural History in New York City to see a fossilized <i>triceratops</i> skeleton.</p><p class="long">The triceratops is one of the most easily recognized dinosaursâ€”it looked a little bit like a rhinoceros. Archaeologists have found many triceratops bones over the years, starting as early as 1889, including complete skeletons, which is why we know a lot about how this dinosaur lived. Triceratops was an herbivore that was probably preyed on by tyrannosaurus. Its three horns may have been used for self-defense, or for courtship and displaying dominance among other triceratops.</p></div></div>`;
