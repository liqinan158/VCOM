If you can't find your favorite kind of cereal on the shelf, you should ask the <i>grocer</i> to help you.</p><p class="long">The owner or manager of a grocery store is a grocer. This word once meant "one who buys and sells in gross," or in large quantities, from the Anglo-French <i>grosser</i>. By the 16th century, grocer also meant "merchant selling food," but earlier that person would've been called a <i>spicer</i>. Your neighborhood grocer might sell fresh produce from local farmers, unlike that big box supermarket out by the mall.</p></div></div>`;
