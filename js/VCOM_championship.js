The championship is the contest that decides who will be champion. The Super Bowl is a championship. And so are the World Series, the Stanley Cup Finals, and the NBA Finals. Although <i>championship</i> is most often used in sports, you will also hear about the spelling bee championships or chess championships. When you win a championship, you're number one in your field.</p></div></div>`;
