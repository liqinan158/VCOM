Think of "Gilligan's Island," "Survivor," or "Lost" — TV shows that feature folks marooned on islands — and you've got the idea.</p><p class="long"><i>Maroon</i> can be a noun or verb, depending on how you use it. If you maroon your best friend on a deserted island, in addition to being a terrible friend, you're using the word as a verb. If this friend was wearing a brownish-red shirt at the time he was marooned, you would use the adjective <i>maroon</i> to describe the shirt's color.</p></div>`;
