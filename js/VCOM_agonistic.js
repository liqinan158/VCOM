Your <i>agonistic</i> attitude might get you in trouble if you're constantly telling people they're wrong.</p><p class="long">The ancient Olympics were actually called <i>agones</i>, which meant a struggle to achieve glory. So today, <i>agonistic</i> also refers to anything related to these ancient Greek athletic competitions. The marathon, for example, was an early agonistic event. Don't confuse <i>agonistic</i> with the similarly spelled "agnostic," a person who believes it's impossible to know whether or not God exists. However, if you get into a religious argument with an agnostic, you might find them to be very agonistic.</p></div>`;
