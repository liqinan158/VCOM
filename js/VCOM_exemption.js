In the sixties, some people got <i>exemptions</i> from military service during the Vietnam War.</p><p class="long">We don't often think of being left out as a good thing, but when you use the word <i>exemption</i>, you mean that someone has been excluded in a positive way. Children are exemptions, or deductions, on tax forms; the more children you have the less taxes you pay. Some non-profits are tax-exempt; their exemption means they pay no taxes at all. Exemptions also spare people from fighting in wars and doing some jobs. An exemption gets you off the hook.</p></div>`;
