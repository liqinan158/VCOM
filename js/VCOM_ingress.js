If you work in a busy restaurant, you have to keep your kitchen <i>ingress</i> and egress straight or you risk a catastrophe with a full tray of dishes.</p><p class="long">In astronomy, <i>ingress</i> is also an act of entering, but it is at the beginning of an eclipse when the celestial body first begins to block the sun and cast a shadow. So in a lunar eclipse, ingress is when the Earth begins to pass between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow on the Moon. In a solar eclipse, ingress is when the Moon begins to pass across the face of the Sun, blocking it from the sight of observers on Earth.</p></div></div>`;
