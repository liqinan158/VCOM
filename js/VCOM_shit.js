Or it's used as an emphatic exclamation roughly meaning "oh no!" Despite its commonness, <i>shit</i> is still considered inappropriate.</p><p class="long">When you stub your toe or cut yourself, it's pretty hard not to say "Shit!" Still, you'd better try to avoid it in most settings, because <i>shit</i> is an obscenity that many people do not want to hear. It's probably a bad word because poop is generally considered pretty disgusting. So even though we all shit, and we all probably say <i>shit</i>, we need to be careful who we're saying it around.</p></div>`;
