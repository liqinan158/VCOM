It's probably smarter to ask your cheerful grandma for a ride to school, instead of your <i>ill-tempered</i> mom.</p><p class="long">Whenever you find yourself in an irritable, grouchy mood, you're ill-tempered. A really good kindergarten teacher will save his ill-tempered remarks for when he goes home after school, and an ill-tempered high school volleyball coach may end up with players quitting the team. Everyone's ill-tempered from time to time â€” the word combines <i>ill</i>, "bad," and <i>tempered</i>, from <i>temper</i>, or "mood," from the Latin root <i>temperare</i>, "be moderate."</p></div></div>`;
