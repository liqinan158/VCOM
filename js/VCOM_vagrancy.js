In many places, the category of <i>vagrancy</i> includes things like loitering and panhandling.</p><p class="long">Arresting people for vagrancy — essentially for not having a permanent home — has been controversial for a long time in the U.S. Opponents consider such a charge to be unconstitutional, since it's not a crime to be so poor or disenfranchised that you don't have a place to live and must rely on charity. Still, many people connect vagrancy with crime and laziness. The Germanic root of this word means "wander."</p></div></div>`;
