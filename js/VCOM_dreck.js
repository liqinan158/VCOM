While you can find great bargains at a dollar store, most of what they sell is <i>dreck</i>.</p><p class="long">Use the word <i>dreck</i> when you're talking about products that are worthless, flimsy, or of poor quality. Terrible art and trashy shows on TV are also dreck, as is a badly written book or a political speech that's full of lies and exaggeration. What these things have in common is a lack of value or quality. <i>Dreck</i> is a Yiddish word that comes from the German <i>Dreck</i>, which means both "dirt" and "manure."</p></div></div>`;
