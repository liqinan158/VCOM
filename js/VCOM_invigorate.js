If you're the new cheerleading coach, you can <i>invigorate</i> the team by bringing them your exciting new cheers, and the team’s growing popularity will <i>invigorate</i> them even more.</p><p class="long">When you invigorate someone, you inspire, you breathe life into them. One of the best ways to invigorate another person is with your own enthusiasm — when you're animated and energetic, it seems to rub off on others. You might need to invigorate yourself when you first wake up in the morning, with a cup of coffee or a shower to get you going for the day. The word <i>invigorate</i> comes from the Latin <i>in</i>, "toward" and <i>vigorare</i> "make strong."</p></div>`;
