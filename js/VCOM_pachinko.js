If you are in Japan and have a yen for gambling, try <i>pachinko</i> instead of a slot machine.</p><p class="long">Pinball aficionados may be familiar with this Japanese loaner, a 20th century word that means a form of pinball popular in Japan. The first part of the word is imitative and is eerily similar to English ka-ching! the <i>â€“ko</i> on the end is a diminutive suffix. If you need a little color in your life, do an image search on the word.</p></div></div>`;
