If you head to a cabin without your mobile devices, you might call that a <i>Thoreauvian</i> vacation.</p><p class="long">You can call a magazine article Thoreauvian if its style is similar to that of the nineteenth century transcendentalist writer Henry David Thoreau â€” emphasizing concrete images and using classical references and occasionally poetic language. Thoreau's best known book is "Walden," which praised nature, simplicity, and the importance of living an authentic, deliberate life. Lifestyles that resemble Thoreau's stay in the woods while he wrote "Walden" can themselves be described as Thoreauvian.</p></div></div>`;
