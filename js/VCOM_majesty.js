The Grand Canyon has it, and so does a British monarch (supposedly).</p><p class="long">The word <i>majesty</i> brings to mind a luxurious castle, which is appropriate because it is also used to address or refer to a king or queen. The Latin root word is <i>maiestatem</i>, which means "greatness, dignity, or excellence," and people first used the noun <i>majesty</i> to talk about God. It was England's King Henry VIII who decided that <i>majesty</i> would be the official way to address a British monarch.</p></div></div>`;
