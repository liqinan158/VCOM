When something is so large or numerous you can hardly believe it, it has the quality of <i>immensity.</i>.</p><p class="long">Something enormous is <i>immense</i>, and the quality of being immense is <i>immensity</i>. This is a strong word for truly gigantic things and creatures. You might, for example, comment on the immensity of the Grand Canyon, or the immensity of the night sky as seen from a boat on the sea. The noun <i>immensity</i> comes from the Latin word <i>immensitatem</i>, "immeasurableness." In other words, if it's too big to be measured, it has the quality of immensity.</p></div>`;
