A wise parent can tell who ate the last of the birthday cake by the <i>telltale</i> chocolate smudges on the culprit's face.</p><p class="long">The telltale dark circles under your teacher's eyes betray how little sleep he got last night, and a telltale bulge in a shopper's pocket is sometimes enough for a store owner to suspect she's a shoplifter. If it's telltale, its very presence reveals something. A famous occurrence of <i>telltale</i>, although it's spelled with a hyphen, is Edgar Allen Poe's story "The Tell-Tale Heart," about a murderer who imagines he's betrayed by the telltale beating of his victim's heart.</p></div></div>`;
