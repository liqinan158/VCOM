Not that there’s ever a good reason for killing, but <i>massacres</i> are especially pointless and gory.</p><p class="long">It’s unclear where the word <i>massacre</i> came from, but possibly it was the Old French word <i>macacre</i>, which means “slaughterhouse.”  As a noun, <i>massacre</i> is a brutal slaughter of humans or animals, and it can be a verb as well, like when an army massacres an entire village of innocent people.  Pronounce it like MASS-uh-ker, and remember to spell it with an <i>acre</i> at the end, which is how much land is needed to bury the bodies after a massacre.</p></div>`;
