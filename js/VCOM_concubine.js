These women were called <i>concubines</i>, and they often were treated better than the manâ€™s wife.</p><p class="long">The word <i>concubine</i> comes from the Latin verb, <i>cubare</i>, which means "to lie down." The word developed in Middle English in the 13th Century, and is another name for a woman taken as a mistress. The practice was common  throughout history: the Bible includes many references to concubines, and in ancient China, a ruler might have had thousands of concubines, some treated well, some like prostitutes. Sad to say, the practice is still going on, acceptable in some countries today.</p></div></div>`;
