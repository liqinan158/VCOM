When threatened with the loss of her fortune, an heiress might <i>deign</i> to get a job, but she might look down her nose at the people she'd have to work with.</p><p class="long"><i>Deign</i> has the same origins as <i>dignity</i>. Both descend from the Latin word, <i>dignare</i>, meaning "to deem worthy." If you deign to do something, you don't feel it's worthy of your lofty stature, but you do it anyway â€” it's like you're doing someone a really big favor. Instead of admitting his wrongdoing, the politician who is accused of taking bribes might indignantly declare, "I won't deign to dignify your ridiculous accusations with a response!"</p></div></div>`;
