There's nothing like a <i>brisk</i> walk in the morning to get the blood flowing and the spirit ready for the day.</p><p class="long">Anything <i>brisk</i> is happening quickly but not too fast. Probably taken from the French <i>brusque</i>, which also means "quick," but in a more negative way, <i>brisk</i> can be used to describe not only physical actions but also more conceptual notions, such as brisk business around the holidays or brisk interactions at a speed-dating event. The soft-drink called Brisk must be called that for a good reason. Perhaps it picks you up!</p></div>`;
