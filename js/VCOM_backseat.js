Kids sometimes fight over the front seat, not wanting to sit in the <i>backseat</i>.</p><p class="long">You can travel in the backseat of a automobile, unless you're the driver or are riding in a two-seat sports car. Another way to use the word <i>backseat</i> is to describe "an inferior position." If you take a backseat to your older brother, it means he tends to get all the attention. The word, more commonly written as <i>back seat</i>, was used in the 1800s to talk about riding in coaches and carriages.</p></div>`;
