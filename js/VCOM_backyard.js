Some people have decks or patios in their <i>backyard</i>.</p><p class="long">If you live in a city, you'll consider yourself lucky to have a tiny backyard where you can sit on a sunny day. In the suburbs, houses often have identical, fenced-in backyards. And in the country, your backyard might extend for acres. The word is sometimes hyphenated, <i>back-yard</i>, or spelled as two separate words. It's been in use since the 1600s, combining <i>back</i> and <i>yard</i>, from the Old English <i>geard</i>, "enclosure, garden, or court."</p></div></div>`;
