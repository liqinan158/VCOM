It's one of those numbers like "sixty" or "seventy" that is formed by attaching a number in the range of 1-9 and "ty" to represent values in the tens place starting with that number. And if you were alive during the nineties (the years from 1990-1999), you probably watched a lot of "Seinfeld" and "Friends."</p></div>`;
