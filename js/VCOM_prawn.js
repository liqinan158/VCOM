In many English-speaking parts of the world, <i>prawn</i> is the more common term, while North Americans reserve that word for freshwater shrimp (as opposed to ocean shrimp). <i>Prawn</i> is a common name, rather than a scientific one â€” if you want to sound knowledgable, you can call this animal a decapod crustacean of the sub-order <i>Dendrobranchiata</i>.</p></div>`;
