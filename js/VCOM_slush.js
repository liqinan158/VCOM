A sweet, icy drink is also a <i>slush</i> or a <i>slushy</i>, while a "<i>slush</i> pile" is a heap of manuscripts and letters that are sent, unsolicited, to a publisher. And a "<i>slush</i> fund" is either an extra, backup bank account, or a secret one full of illegally obtained money. One thing is for sure: slush is messy.</p></div></div>`;
