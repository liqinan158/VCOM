A  <i>bridge</i> connects things. The <i>bridge</i> of your nose connects your nose to your head — it's where the <i>bridge</i> of your eyeglasses rests.</p><p class="long">If you insult your boss and quit your job, you've "burned your <i>bridges</i>" — you can’t go back. If you're not going to worry yourself about a possible problem, you can say "I'll cross that <i>bridge</i> when I get to it." The vertical piece that holds the strings up on a violin, guitar, or other stringed instrument is also a bridge, and in a song, the bridge is the part between a verse and the chorus — the transition between them.</p></div>`;
