Some people believe that the word comes from the Old French <i>havot</i>, meaning “plundering, devastation,” while others argue that it was passed down to us from the Latin <i>habere</i>, meaning “to have, possess.” Either way you look at it, the meaning remains the same: widespread disorder or destruction.</p></div></div>`;
