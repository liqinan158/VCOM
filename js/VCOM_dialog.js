You might have a dialog with your boss if you're unhappy with your work hours and want to sit down and discuss your schedule. <i>Dialog</i> comes straight from the Greek <i>dialogos</i> with pretty much the same meaning, although it was originally used to mean a very formal type of speech or conversation.</p></div></div>`;
