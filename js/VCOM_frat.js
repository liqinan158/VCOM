The stereotypical <i>frat</i> boy is a rich kid on spring break drinking beer, doing chest bumps, and crashing Daddyâ€™s Mercedes. But of course some <i>frat</i> boys are very nice. Seriously, bro.</p><p class="long">The word <i>frat</i> is short for <i>fraternity</i>, and both words mean "body of men associated by common interest," from the Latin root <i>fraternitatem</i>, or "brotherhood." A frat will usually have their own house and a name made up of two or three Greek letters. A frat can be a close-knit community of young men who live, work, and volunteer in the community together. Some frats, however, are exclusionary societies that haze new members and throw drunken campus parties.</p></div>`;
