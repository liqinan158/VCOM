If it's 3 pm and you still have to study for three exams and write an essay before midnight, it’s <i>implausible</i> that you’ll also have time to watch a movie.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>implausible</i> breaks down into <i>im</i>, meaning “not,” and <i>plausible</i>, meaning "likely." So it simply means "not likely." Implausible ideas or stories usually get high marks for creativity, but they're just too crazy to be believable. But as philosopher René Descartes noted, “One cannot conceive anything so strange and so implausible that it has not already been said by one philosopher or another.”</p></div></div>`;
