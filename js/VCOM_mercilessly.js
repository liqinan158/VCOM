Whenever possible, it’s best to avoid people who act <i>mercilessly</i>.</p><p class="long">When you show mercy, you're kind and empathetic. Without any mercy, you’re <i>merciless</i>, and when you act this way you act <i>mercilessly</i>. You show no pity! Some big brothers kid their little sisters mercilessly, and a judge who gives the maximum sentence for a minor crime has ruled mercilessly. <i>Mercy</i> is at the root of <i>mercilessly</i>, from the Old French <i>merci</i>, which means both "thanks" and "pity." If people act mercilessly, tell them thanks for nothing!</p></div>`;
