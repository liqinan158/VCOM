Use it as a connector between thoughts and sentences that logically follow.  You were present during the robbery; <i>ergo</i>, you were called as a witness.</p><p class="long"><i>Ergo</i> appeared in late Middle English meaning "therefore," probably from the Old Latin root <i>regere</i>, "to guide." You can see the relation to the word as it is used today, to present a connection between ideas where a second sentence or idea is "guided" by, or draws a logical conclusion from the first one. Satirist Jonathan Swift once wrote, “Words are but wind; and learning is nothing but words; ergo, learning is nothing but wind.”</p></div></div>`;
