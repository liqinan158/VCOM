I sense the <i>fatalism</i> in you, but you CAN change things!</p><p class="long">You can see and hear the word "fate" in the word <i>fatalism</i>. It means "destiny" — the notion that all things are meant to be and that there is nothing you can do to change them. Someone "fatalistic" — who displays fatalism — sees life as a series of inevitable, predetermined events. Often, this term is used negatively to describe someone who refuses to try to shape their own lives or who gives up too easily. Fatalism may in fact be a logical response to life, but that's no reason not to try to change things!</p></div>`;
