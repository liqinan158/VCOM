If you want to keep the peace during dinner, you should probably bite your tongue instead of making sarcastic <i>retorts</i> to everything your little sister says.</p><p class="long">Today <i>retort</i> is used as both a noun and a verb, and both come from 16th- and 17th-century sources meaning "to twist or turn back." To retort is to make a comeback, or a quick, witty answer or remark. It can be a form of payback when someone tries to insult or tease another person, and often, the perfect retort doesn't occur to you till later, when you think "Oh! I wish I had said that earlier!"</p></div></div>`;
