A defendant in a murder trial commits <i>perjury</i> when he swears he never met the murder victim before, even though he had a two-year relationship with her.</p><p class="long">Although the word <i>perjury</i> contains <i>jury</i>, members of the jury aren't likely to commit perjury, because they're not under oath and haven't sworn to be truthful. A witness in a trial can commit perjury by willfully lying about facts related to the case. <i>Perjury</i> isn't just a little white lie. It's a crime that can land the person who commits it in jail.</p></div></div>`;
