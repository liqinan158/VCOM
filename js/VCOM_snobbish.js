Your <i>snobbish</i> cousin might refuse to borrow your rain coat because it looks "cheap."</p><p class="long">If you're snobbish, you believe there are different social classes of people, and that you belong to the highest one. A snobbish person might think that graduating from a certain college makes him better than others, or that having more money makes him superior to those with less. The root is <i>snob</i>, which evolved from meaning "shoemaker" in 1700's Britain to being university slang for "ordinary person who apes his social superiors" to "one who despises those he considers inferior."</p></div></div>`;
