If you watch a horror movie, one of the necessary plot elements is for the villain to <i>dismember</i> a body or two... or twelve.</p><p class="long"><i>Dismember</i> is from the Latin word <i>dismembrare</i>, which itself is from the Latin roots <i>de</i>, meaning "take away," and <i>membrum</i>, meaning "limb." The verb <i>dismember</i> also means to cut up into pieces or take apart. If you are doing genealogical research on your family tree you may have difficulty if your ancestors are from a region that was dismembered.  You may know your family was from the Soviet Union, for example, but since that country was dismembered, you now may need to check records in Uzbekistan or Azerbaijan to find the branches of your family tree.</p></div></div>`;
