Usually clever, <i>maxims</i> are like great sayings everybody knows. Ben Franklin is the author of many, including "Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise."</p><p class="long">A <i>maxim</i> sums up a fundamental principle or truth about something in a way that captures the imagination and gets repeated.

An overused maxim of real estate is "Location, location, location." Confucius was spewing maxims long before Vogue hit the magazine stands: "He who learns but does not think is lost."</p></div></div>`;
