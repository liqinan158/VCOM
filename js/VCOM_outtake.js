If an actor forgets his lines, for example, that scene will probably end up as an <i>outtake</i>.</p><p class="long">Making a film is a long process that involves many steps even after the actual filming of actors reciting dialog and acting out scenes is long over. Editors cut unnecessary bits out of movies, discarding outtakes and shaping a final product. Occasionally these outtakes are interesting or funny enough that directors will include them as extras on a DVD of a movie. <i>Outtake</i> dates from about 1960.</p></div></div>`;
