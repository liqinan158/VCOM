If your neighbor gets hit with a water balloon and looks up to see you leaning out of your window with another balloon in your hand, that's a compromising situation for you â€” it makes you look suspicious. Another way to use <i>compromising</i> is to mean "willing to compromise." It would be compromising of you to agree on pizza for dinner, even though you had your heart set on lasagna.</p></div>`;
