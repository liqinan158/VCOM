Your grandmother might look <i>invigorated</i> after her month-long vacation in Hawaii.</p><p class="long">Use the adjective <i>invigorated</i> to describe a person who's glowing with health or whose eyes are shining with enthusiasm. Your cousins may be famous for their invigorated expressions, beaming with energy; or you may return from a long swim in a cold lake feeling invigorated. At the heart of <i>invigorated</i> is <i>vigor</i>, which means "health or strength." It comes from the Latin <i>vigorem</i>, "liveliness, activity, or force."</p></div>`;
