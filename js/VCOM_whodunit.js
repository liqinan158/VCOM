A well-written <i>whodunit</i> can keep you up late turning pages, eager for the ending to be revealed.</p><p class="long">If a book, play, or movie is a whodunit, there's usually a detective investigating what's almost always a murder case. The key to the plot, which is generally complex and confusing, is the question implicit in the informal <i>whodunit</i>: "Who (has) done it?" Since it was coined around 1930 in the U.S., this term has been common for a particular type of mystery or detective story.</p></div>`;
