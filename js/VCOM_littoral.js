A <i>littoral</i> state has a coast, so Florida, California, and North Carolina are <i>littoral</i> states, to name a few.</p><p class="long">If you live far away from any water, then you probably won't hear the word <i>littoral</i> much because it refers to things related to shores and coasts. A house overlooking the ocean is littoral. A business is littoral if it sells things to people hanging out on the beach. You can also use <i>littoral</i> as a noun to mean the area near a coast or shore â€” if you grew up near the water, you grew up in a littoral.</p></div></div>`;
