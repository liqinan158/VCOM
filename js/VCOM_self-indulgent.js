Enjoy a <i>self-indulgent</i> day at the spa! But <i>self-indulgent</i> can also mean “selfish,” like a rambling <i>self-indulgent </i> speech that puts the audience to sleep.</p><p class="long">Eating whatever you feel like, even if it's ice cream for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, is self-indulgent. Spending an entire day lying in a hammock when you have a project to work on for school is also self-indulgent. You just do what you feel like doing: in other words, you <i>indulge</i> yourself. <i>Indulge</i>, "to grant as an unearned favor," comes from the Latin <i>indulgere</i>, "be kind, yield, or concede."</p></div>`;
