The <i>gloom</i> of a moonless autumn evening is perfect for trick-or-treating, but not so perfect for sizing up your candy stash.</p><p class="long">It might make you nervous to walk in the gloom of your friend's rural neighborhood at night if you're used to well-lit city streets. And while gloom perfectly describes the near-dark of dusk or a foggy evening, it can also describe a dark, dismal mood. Your brother's gloom when his favorite basketball team loses in the playoffs will only deepen if your favorite team wins the tournament. <i>Gloom</i> is a Scottish word, originally meaning "a sullen look."</p></div>`;
