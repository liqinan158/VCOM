When you <i>enhance</i> something, you heighten it or make it better.</p><p class="long">"Hance" is not a word, but the addition of "en-" does something to <i>enhance</i> it and improve its sound. You can enhance the size of something, too, by altering it or raising it, which is what the word original meant (the "hance" part came via French from Latin <i>altus</i>, meaning "high"). When you <i>enhance</i> something you take it to a higher level, like adding salt to French fries to enhance flavor or adding words to enhance your vocabulary.</p></div>`;
