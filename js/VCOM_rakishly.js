var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">rakishly</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you do something <i>rakishly</i>, you're doing it in a careless, charming way while also conveying a sense of being a bit disreputable. A mischievous magician might grin <i>rakishly</i> as he suavely transforms your ten-dollar bill into a quarter.</p><p class="long">People who behave rakishly have an undeniable charm. You can even use this adverb to describe the way someone dresses, or their sense of style: "Her hat was tipped rakishly to the side, giving her a jaunty appeal." Underlying this charisma is a sense of depravity, as in the case of a pickpocket who flirts rakishly with his victims as he's stealing their wallets. <i>Rakishly</i> comes from <i>rake</i>, "idle, dissolute person."</p></div>`;
