The Latin word <i>conus</i> means "the peak of a helmet," which must have described the shape of this type of hat in the 16th century. The Greek <i>konos</i> means "spinning top" and "pine cone." Both of these objects have one wider end that tapers to a point, describing a cone very accurately.</p></div>`;
