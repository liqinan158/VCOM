That curiously-shaped stone you found in your yard may be part of a <i>neolithic</i> axe — or just an ordinary rock.</p><p class="long">When archaeologists use this term, they tend to capitalize it. It's also known as the "New Stone Age," and that's exactly what <i>neolithic</i> means — <i>neo</i>, "new," and <i>-lith</i>, "stone." The Neolithic period occurred about 12,000 years ago, when people began to farm and used polished stone tools, and it was followed by the Bronze Age. If you want to scornfully refer to something as outdated or passé, you can also call it neolithic.</p></div>`;
