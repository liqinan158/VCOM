var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">non sequitur</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>non sequitur</i> is a conclusion or reply that doesn’t follow logically from the previous statement. You’ve probably heard an example of a <i>non sequitur</i> before, therefore bunny rabbits are way cuter than chipmunks.</p><p class="long">Non sequiturs are often used for comedic effect in movies, novels, and TV shows. When someone says a non sequitur, it usually means the person was off in her own thoughts and not listening to the other person. Imagine that one girl says, “I’m worried that my sister is mad at me,” and her friend replies, “I wonder what you call a male ladybug?” The non sequitur shows the friend clearly wasn't listening.</p></div>`;
