Many patients being treated for cancer have <i>immunodeficiencies</i>.</p><p class="long">Your immune system is the network of cells that works to fight infection throughout your body, and when it isn't functioning well, the result is immunodeficiency. The word is rooted in the Latin <i>immunis</i>, "exempt," and <i>deficere</i>, "to fail." In other words, immunodeficiency is a failure of the system that keeps you free from infections and illness. Various diseases, genetic conditions, and medications can result in this risky situation.</p></div></div>`;
