In books, movies, current events, or history, the <i>villain</i> is the character who does mean, evil things on purpose.</p><p class="long">Today a villain is a wicked person, whether in fact or fiction. In the 1300s, <i>villain</i> described a low-born rustic. It came from the Medieval Latin word <i>villanus</i>, or farmhand. Just why a word would evolve from meaning <i>farmer</i> into <i>evildoer</i> is a little mysterious, although it probably has to do with farmers not being chivalrous, like the knights who were so admired in those days.</p></div>`;
