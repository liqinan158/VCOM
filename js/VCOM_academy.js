You can also use <i>academy</i> to describe the world of higher learning.</p><p class="long">If you show unusual gifts as a clarinetist, you should consider attending the music <i>academy</i> in the next town. That's where you'll learn the most about your art. It's a private school, the Goodman Academy of Music, named after Benny Goodman, who was the greatest jazz clarinetist ever. If you want to use <i>academy</i> in its other sense, try "Those home experiments are cool, but without peer review, the <i>academy</i> will never accept them as science." Darn academy.</p></div>`;
