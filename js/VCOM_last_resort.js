If every hotel and reception hall is booked, a couple may end up getting married in their own backyard as a <i>last resort</i>.</p><p class="long">This phrase, which has been used in English since the 17th century, comes from a French legal term, <i>en dernier ressort</i>. This was a type of court or legal case that didn't allow appeals, but instead cast final, permanent decisions. Today we use <i>last resort</i> for things that are our last choice; you should try to reason with your neighbor about his barking dog, only calling the police as a last resort.</p></div></div>`;
