A <i>forgettable</i> meal at a restaurant might be bland, and a <i>forgettable</i> book may not have much of a plot.</p><p class="long">When something is easy to forget and hard to remember, it's forgettable. This adjective is particularly popular with critics, as an easy way to convey how mediocre something is. You might have loved every single Pixar movie except for <i>Cars,</i> which you found to be totally forgettable. And while you're a fan of a band's first album, their recent one is simply forgettable â€” in fact, you can't recall a single song.</p></div>`;
