var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">inopportune</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Since the meaning of "opportune" is "favorable" or "well-timed," it's easy to guess that the meaning of <i>inopportune</i> means something that is ill-timed or inappropriate. That little prefix <i>in-</i> means "not," and it totally turns the meaning of a word around.</p><p class="long">Think of the Latin word <i>opportunus</i>, which means "fitting" or "opportune." When you add <i>in-</i> in front of it, or any word, you give the word the opposite meaning. That's the history of the word <i>inopportune</i>, which has been used since the early 16th century to describe something that is "not fitting." For example, "She opened the door at an <i>inopportune</i> moment and saw him fire the gun." Bad timing? You bet. And very inopportune.</p></div>`;
