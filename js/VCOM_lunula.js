Well, that word plays into the meaning of <i>lunula</i>, which is something with a curved, half-moon shape — like the white at the base of your fingernails.</p><p class="long">The Latin word for moon is <i>lūna</i>, which was also one of the name of the Roman moon goddess. From that we get <i>lunula</i>, which is the name of the nail matrix, the living part of the fingernail and toenail, a visible white, half-moon-shape at the nail’s base. Here's a spelling hint: the plural of <i>lunula</i> is <i>lunulae</i>, adding an <i>e</i> instead of an <i>s</i>, a spelling rule peculiar to words that have a Latin origin and end in <i>a</i>.</p></div>`;
