Some people prefer hearty <i>buckwheat</i> pancakes to the lighter and fluffier white flour version.</p><p class="long">Despite the similar names, buckwheat isn't related to wheat â€” its closer cousins are rhubarb and sorrel. It grows triangular-shaped seeds that can be cooked and eaten whole or ground into flour for use in foods like Japanese soba noodles. The word comes from the Middle Dutch <i>boecweite</i>, "beech wheat," based on buckwheat's resemblance to the seeds of the beech tree.</p></div>`;
