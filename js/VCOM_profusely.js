If you sweat <i>profusely</i> whenever your crush walks into a room, you might reconsider your ban on deodorant before asking him out.</p><p class="long"><i>Profuse</i> is an adjective meaning, basically, "a lot." Add the <i>-ly</i> and there's the adverb <i>profusely</i>, used to describe something that's giving off a lot — of blood, sweat, and tears for example. You might bleed profusely after you cut your thumb and cry profusely when your sweetie doesn't even offer you a Band-Aid. Other words with similar meanings include <i>abundantly</i>, <i>extravagantly</i>, <i>lavishly</i>, and <i>richly</i>.
