A <i>pallette</i> is a metal plate on a suit of armor.</p><p class="long">When you spell <i>pallette</i> with two <i>l</i>'s and two <i>t</i>'s, you're talking about an armor plate, specifically the rounded pieces under the arms. The word <i>pallette</i> is rarely used, and when it is it's often a mistake, since it can be tricky to distinguish <i>pallette</i> from <i>palette</i>, an artist's set of colors, and <i>pallet</i>, a kind of makeshift bed.</p></div></div>`;
