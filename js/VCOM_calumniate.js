var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">calumniate</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>calumniate</i> is to make a false accusation against someone or spread lies about how awful they are. Don’t <i>calumniate</i> your rival in the race for class president, because when the truth comes out, you’ll be the bad guy.</p><p class="long">The courts would say to calumniate is to slander. Everyone else would just say it’s mean. <i>Calumniate</i> is just a fancier way of saying “lie” — but specifically lying to tarnish someone's reputation. If your sister says you purposely broke a vase and you didn't, she calumniates you. If you get in trouble in class, you could calumniate to the principal about your teacher being a wretched mess — but the other students might speak up and prove you wrong.</p></div>`;
