You're hurting — either physically or mentally.</p><p class="long">See the word <i>stress</i> hanging out at the end of <i>distress</i>? There's a good reason for that. The noun <i>distress</i> refers to a state of severe anxiety or strain, often brought about by failing to study for an exam, harassing grizzly bears, or borrowing your sister's clothes without asking. When used as a verb, to <i>distress</i> means to cause all that pain, suffering and anxiety — in other words, to stress somebody out.</p></div>`;
