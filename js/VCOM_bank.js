Besides the ones connected with money — like a savings bank or a piggy bank — a bank is also a slope of grass or earth, such as a river bank. Both of these are rooted in a Germanic word, <i>bankiz</i>, or "bank of earth." From this root came words meaning "shelf" and "table." The money-related <i>bank</i> came from the "table" meaning, <i>banque</i> in Middle French, as in "moneylender's exchange table."</p></div></div>`;
