Your house is inhabitable, but your mom's pickup truck isn't really inhabitable. If you can <i>inhabit</i>, or live in a place, it's <i>inhabitable</i>, from the Latin <i>inhabitare</i>, "dwell in." An earlier definition of <i>inhabitable</i> meant completely the opposite: "not able to be lived in," from the roots <i>in-</i>, "not," and <i>habitable</i>, "fit to live in."</p></div>`;
