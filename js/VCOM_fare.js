As a verb, it means to proceed or get along, as in "<i>Fare</i> thee well." As a noun, it can refer to the cost of travel ("Train <i>fare</i> is ten dollars") or to food ("Tatertots are typical cafeteria <i>fare</i>").</p><p class="long">To remember <i>fare's</i> different meanings, think of how, for people living close to the bone, the question "How are you eating/faring?" is not so different from "How are you getting along/faring?" And when you pay plane fare and fly to France, you will most assuredly be eating French fare once you get there.</p></div>`;
