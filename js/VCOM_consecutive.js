If there are five <i>consecutive</i> snowstorms on five <i>consecutive</i> days,   you'll have to shovel your way out on day six.</p><p class="long"><i>Consecutive</i> comes from the Latin <i>consecutus</i>, meaning "following closely" with no gap. Just like those snowstorms â€” one storm happened each day, back to back, for five days in a row. Consecutive numbers also follow each other, or advance in the right order. For example, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 are consecutive numbers. You should number the pages on a term paper to keep them consecutive so the teacher doesn't get confused.</p></div>`;
