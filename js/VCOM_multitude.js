If you see a <i> multitude</i> of zombies approaching, you're in trouble.</p><p class="long">Sometimes the word <i>multitude</i> refers to the common people, or the masses â€” that is, everyone in a society apart from the political elite.  There are a lot of words and phrases for this, like <i>hoi polloi</i>, which is Greek for "the many," and "the great unwashed."  Those last two terms are usually used in a disapproving way, but multitudes is generally a positive term. If you were to say that a leader inspired the multitudes to rise up against their oppressor, we'd assume that you sympathized with the multitudes.</p></div>`;
