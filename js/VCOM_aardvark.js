You might see an <i>aardvark</i> if you visit a zoo.</p><p class="long">Some people call aardvarks "antbears," because of their diet of small insects. Aardvarks are the size of a badger or small pig, and they tend to be nocturnal, burrowing for food at night with their long tongues and sleeping during the day. The word <i>aardvark</i> comes from Afrikaans Dutch, literally meaning "earth-pig," a combination of <i>aard</i>, "earth," and <i>vark</i>, "pig."</p></div></div>`;
