You could call that <i>dross.</i> No one wants it, and it's harmful if it stays.</p><p class="long">While <i>dross</i> is a noun for stuff that's physically left over or useless, like the nonmetallic stuff left when metal gets refined, it's also used for people and forms of art. A really bad movie can be called <i>dross,</i> and a low or despicable person can be dross. Debris, or trash, is another form of dross.
