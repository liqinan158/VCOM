More broadly, it is the idea that people should prioritize the good of society over the welfare of the individual.</p><p class="long">Collectivism — so closely related to the word <i>collection</i> — has to do with political theories that put the group before the individual. In a collectivist system, power should be in the hands of the people as a whole, not in the hands of a few powerful folks. Collectivism is the opposite of individualism. Ideally, in a collectivist society, decisions benefit all the people. This is a difficult idea to put into practice, as seen in the attempted collectivist society of Soviet communism.</p></div></div>`;
