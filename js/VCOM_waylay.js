Robbers waylay their victims. Outlaws waylaid stagecoaches in the Old West.  The verb's origin, from <i>wegelage</i>, means "lying in wait, with evil or hostile intent." You might also use <i>waylay</i> to show someone being interrupted from finishing the task at hand: "I shouldâ€™ve been studying, but was <i>waylaid</i> by my friend's invitation to go bungee jumping."</p></div></div>`;
