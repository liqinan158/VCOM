var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">title</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>title</i> is typically the official part of your name, placed at the beginning to signify a certain status or function. So, do you prefer "Mr.," "Mrs.," "Dr." or "Ms"? Or perhaps you just go by "Grand Pooh-bah"?</p><p class="long">There seem to be as many ways to use the word <i>title</i> as there are titles on a library shelf — because a title is also what you call a book or song or work of art. Titles are even given to statutes and acts of legislature. When you buy a car, you get a title, which is a piece of paper certifying your ownership. And when your favorite team wins the championship? You often say they won the title — and the right to brag.</p></div>`;
