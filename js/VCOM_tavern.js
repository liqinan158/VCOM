A tavern is a drinking establishment that rents rooms â€” in England, it's much more common to call such a place an "inn." The earliest, thirteenth century meaning of <i>tavern</i> was "wine shop," and by the 1400's it meant "public house or inn." The root word is the Latin <i>taberna</i>, "hut, shop, or inn."</p></div></div>`;
