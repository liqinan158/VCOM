An <i>unstressed</i> person is someone for whom every day feels like Sunday.</p><p class="long">When you pronounce a word with multiple syllables, like <i>avocado</i> (to choose a random example), you put more pressure on some syllables than others — in this case, the <i>ah</i> and the <i>cah</i>.  Consider those syllables <i>stressed</i>.  If they were people, they'd be biting their nails and pulling out their hair while sitting at a desk piled with paperwork.  The <i>vo</i> and the <i>do</i>, on the other hand, would be <i>unstressed</i> — lounging with their feet on the desk, doing crossword puzzles.</p></div></div>`;
