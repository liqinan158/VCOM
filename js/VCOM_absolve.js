The Church may absolve you of your sins, but that won't absolve you of the need to attend mass.</p><p class="long">The Latin <i>absolvere</i>, which means "to set free," is the root of the word <i>absolve</i>. In the religious sense, to be absolved means to be truly forgiven in the eyes of the Lord, which must feel like being set free. In a more mundane everyday usage, <i>absolve</i> can be used to describe being let off the hook. For instance, putting a campaign poster in your window does not absolve you of the responsibility to vote.</p></div></div>`;
