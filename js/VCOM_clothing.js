Your favorite piece of <i>clothing</i> might be your purple polka dotted tights.</p><p class="long">Clothing is made of fabric and covers our bodies, keeps them warm or protects them from the sun, insects, sharp rocks and thorns, and other hazards. In some situations, clothing keeps people safe, as when medical workers wear scrubs, gloves, and masks to protect themselves and patients from infection. Often clothing reflects your personal values or religion, like a Muslim woman's hijab that covers her hair. The Old English root is <i>cla√æ</i>, "cloth or woven material."</p></div>`;
