If your teacher doesn't punish her math class for climbing out the classroom windows, she may be accused of <i>laxity</i>.</p><p class="long">A government's laxity with regulations can result in big companies taking advantage of the situation. Likewise, a babysitter's laxity with his young charges can result in mayhem, or at the very least an extremely late bedtime. A physical kind of <i>laxity</i> is a literal looseness, especially of muscles and ligaments: "If you over-stretch before your run, your muscles' <i>laxity</i> can harm your joints." The Latin root is <i>laxus</i>, "loose."</p></div>`;
