var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">nonplus</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>nonplus</i> is to baffle or confuse someone to the point that they have nothing to say. Something weird and mysterious can <i>nonplus</i> you, like a play that is performed entirely by chickens.</p><p class="long">If you know a little French or Latin, you'll recognize that "non plus" means "no more." When something bewildering nonpluses you, there's no more you can say or do about it. A goal of getting poor grades, running with a bad crowd, and refusing to eat would leave your parents nonplussed. Sometimes people misuse <i>nonplus</i> to mean "unimpressed," but that's not correct: to <i>nonplus</i> is to puzzle, confuse, and dumbfound.</p></div></div>`;
