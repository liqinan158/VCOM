Biochemical processes occur in living organisms. For example, the way your body converts food into energy is biochemical, as is the way your body fights disease and responds to drugs. The word <i>biochemistry</i> comes from the German <i>biochemisch</i>, and both words combine the Greek <i>bio</i>, "one's life," and <i>chemical</i>, "relating to chemistry."</p></div></div>`;
