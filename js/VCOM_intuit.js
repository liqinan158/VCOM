You might give up on a job interview halfway through, if you <i>intuit</i> that the job wouldn't be a good fit for you.</p><p class="long">When you have a hunch about something, you intuit. For example, a pregnant woman might intuit that she's having twins, and a teacher might intuit that a student is having a hard day and needs some extra attention. The earliest meaning of <i>intuit</i> was "to tutor," until the mid-19th century. The word comes from the Latin root <i>intueri</i>, "look at, comprehend, or contemplate."</p></div></div>`;
