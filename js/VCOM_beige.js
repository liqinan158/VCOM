Khaki pants and coffee with lots of cream might be <i>beige</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Beige</i> does not sound the way it looks.  The "ei" is pronounced like a long "a" (as in "cake") and the "g" is a soft "zh" sound.  This is because <i>beige</i> comes straight out of French, where it originally meant a fabric of the color we now know as <i>beige</i>.  See?  Beige has some interesting qualities for such a boring color.</p></div></div>`;
