When you first wake up, you might be in a  bit of a <i>daze,</i> shuffling about the house before your brain really starts working.</p><p class="long"><i>Daze</i> can also mean the feeling of distress and disbelief that you have when something bad happens to you accidentally: "After getting hit in the head by a football, you were in such a <i>daze</i> you couldn't remember where you were." As a verb, <i>daze</i> means to stun. You will definitely daze your father when you tell him that you eloped.</p></div></div>`;
