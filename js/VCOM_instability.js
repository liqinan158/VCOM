If you've ever walked out onto a diving board, you've probably noticed its <i>instability</i> â€” meaning the board bends and bounces as you move.</p><p class="long"><i>Instability</i> comes from the Middle French word <i>instabilite</i>, meaning "unsteadiness." <i>Instability</i> can refer to objects that are not stable, but it can also describe unpredictable situations or relationships. For example, you might hear people talk about economic instability. Or if your behavior at school grows erratic and unpredictable, you might be asked to speak to a therapist about your psychological instability.</p></div></div>`;
