"The equipment was so sensitive that even the <i>infinitesimal</i> dust molecules that swept in with the open door altered the readings."</p><p class="long"><i>Infinitesimal</i> is such an extreme description of a microscopic something that the word is used as an exaggeration more often than to describe something actually quite small. "The chances of Roxy going out on a date with Norbert were infinitesimal. She barely even knew he existed." <i>Infinitesimal</i> is derived  from the root <i>infinite</i>, which usually conjures up thoughts of immeasurably large quantities or sizes. But in this case, <i>infinite</i> connotes something immeasurably small.</p></div></div>`;
