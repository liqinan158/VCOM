A typical rider on a horse is <i>astride</i> the horse.</p><p class="long">This is a word for a physical position that is easiest to visualize by picturing riders atop horses. While you can ride a horse sidesaddle — with both legs on one side — the usual (and safer) way to ride a horse is astride. When you're astride, you have one leg on each side of a horse: you've mounted the horse. If you climb a fence, you're probably going to find yourself astride the fence for a moment before you get to the other side.</p></div>`;
