Sometimes beachcombers find <i>jetsam</i> washed up on shore.</p><p class="long">You often see the phrase "flotsam and jetsam" because both words refer to wreckage from a ship, but how the stuff got there is the difference. Flotsam is from a shipwreck, and jetsam is thrown off the ship to prevent it from sinking. People often use <i>jetsam</i> to mean any discarded objects, not just from the ocean.</p></div>`;
