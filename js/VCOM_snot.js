You'll want to carry tissues or a handkerchief with you when you're sneezing, to keep the <i>snot</i> contained.</p><p class="long">There are two meanings of the noun <i>snot</i>: the first, mucus, can be unpleasant. The second meaning, an irritatingly arrogant person, is also unpleasant. If a little kid acts like a snot, his babysitter is definitely not going to let him stay up past his bedtime. If you're a snot to your best friend, she might not speak to you the next day. <i>Snot</i> comes from the Old English word <i>gesnot</i>, or "nasal mucus," from a Germanic root.</p></div>`;
