If you’re headed to the silo <i>beyond</i> the barn, that means you’re going to the silo that’s on the far side of the barn.</p><p class="long"><i>Beyond</i> is related to the word <i>yonder</i>, which you might have heard in expressions like, “Over yonder hill, you’ll see a picket fence.” <i>Yonder</i> kind of means “that one over there, in the distance.” <i>Beyond</i> is past <i>yonder</i>. If you’re going above and beyond, it means you’re doing more than was expected. If you’re beyond Kelly in your math homework, it means you’ve done more than she has. And if the show was beyond your expectations, it was better than you had hoped.</p></div></div>`;
