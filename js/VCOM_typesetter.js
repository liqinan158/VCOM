There are also digital <i>typesetters</i> for laying out the type on computer screens.</p><p class="long">Today most typesetting is done by computers, which are skilled at arranging characters on a screen so they're easy to read. So the job of typesetter is a bit of an old-fashioned one, although there are still physical printing presses that require their skill. Letterpress cards, books, and art, which have a raised type that you can feel with your fingertips, are produced by a typesetter who arranges moveable type in the press, inks it, and prints on paper.</p></div>`;
