var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">fulmination</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>fulmination</i> is some kind of explosion â€” either an actual explosion, like a firework, or an explosive expression of anger, like your angry <i>fulminations</i> in reaction to your brother spilling chocolate milk all over your science project.</p><p class="long">The fulminations of an angry mob rushing the gates of the castle don't sound quite the same as the fulminations of an academic disagreement in a political science class, but they both express dissatisfaction, disagreement, or anger. The word <i>fulmination</i>, which usually appears in its plural form, comes from the Latin <i>fulminare</i> "to hurl lightning," and its Proto-Indo-European root meaning "to shine, flash, or burn."</p></div>`;
