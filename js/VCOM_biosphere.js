You wouldn't want to travel beyond the earth's <i>biosphere</i>, unless of course you are an astronaut.</p><p class="long">From the Greek <i>bios,</i> "life," and <i>sphaira,</i> "sphere," <i>biosphere</i> came into English use in the 19th century. It means the life that occurs within a certain sphere or region around a planet. If you're reading this from Mars you probably have a biosphere all your own. You and other living things on Earth need oxygen and other substances to survive, and the biosphere fulfills those needs.</p></div>`;
