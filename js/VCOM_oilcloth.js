You'd be more likely to buy a tablecloth made of <i>oilcloth</i> than a dress.</p><p class="long">Your grandmother might have a brightly colored oilcloth on her kitchen table: it feels smooth as plastic on the top, but the bottom is nubby or soft, absorbent cotton. Oilcloth was once commonly used to make rain coats and tents, but its seams were never totally waterproof, so it was replaced by waxed canvas and other materials. <i>Oilcloth</i> got its name from the boiled linseed oil coating used to make it waterproof.</p></div>`;
