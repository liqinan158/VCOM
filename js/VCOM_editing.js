A good English teacher will tell you that <i>editing</i> is just as important as writing.</p><p class="long">Modifying your short story, cutting out some lines and adding others, is one example of editing. When a US senator makes changes to a complicated bill so it will please both Democrats and Republicans, it's also editing. Editing a work or document often makes it shorter, and it almost always makes it better. The Latin root of <i>editing</i> is <i>editionem</i>, "a bringing forth, producing," or "a statement or account."</p></div></div>`;
