It's not hard to get tangled in a dress if you get the <i>armholes</i> mixed up with the neck opening.</p><p class="long">Sweaters, bathing suits, wedding gowns: these all have armholes. You might call these <i>sleeves</i> in the case of clothing that has them, although sleeveless garments — like chemises and sleeveless dresses — only have armholes. The original meaning of <i>armhole</i>, from the early 14th century, was "armpit" or "underarm," but the contemporary definition has come to be "opening in a garment for a wearer's arm."</p></div>`;
