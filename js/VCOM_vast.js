Even places that can't be seen or touched, like imaginations, are called <i>vast</i>, because of the endless ideas that come out of them. Someone with a vast imagination is very creative, and a place with a vast landscape is very large. Possibilities are vast, and so are the vocabularies of the world, filling vast volumes.</p></div></div>`;
