Elves and fairies can be described as sprites, and so can the water nymphs from Ancient Greek mythology. <i>Sprite</i> comes from the Old French <i>esprit</i>, or "spirit," and the Latin root <i>spiritus</i>. An older alternate spelling, now obsolete, was <i>spright</i>, which led to the adjective <i>sprightly</i>, "animated or lively."</p></div></div>`;
