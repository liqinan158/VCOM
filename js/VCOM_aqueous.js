Some marble can appear <i>aqueous</i> or have a watery-looking surface pattern.</p><p class="long">The word <i>aqueous</i> comes from the Latin <i>aqua</i> meaning "water." If you flip over a product package and read its ingredients, often you'll see water listed at the top, which means that whatever is inside is an aqueous solution, or one that contains water. Salt water is an example of an aqueous solution because salt easily dissolves in water. Essentially, something aqueous either resembles water or is made from water.</p></div></div>`;
