Pilots practice flying planes using <i>simulators</i> long before they take the controls of a jumbo jet.</p><p class="long">You can think of a simulator as a device that mimics or <i>simulates</i> an experience, usually making it feel so real that you'd swear you were driving a car or flying an airplane. Many simulators are used in training people to operate vehicles or machinery, while others help teach medical students how to perform surgery, inject medication, and insert breathing tubes. In Latin, <i>simulator</i> means "copier or feigner," from the root <i>similis</i>, "resembling."</p></div>`;
