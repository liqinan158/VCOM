If you sit down to dinner hanging your head and moaning that it's been an <i>eon</i> since you ate anything, you’re exaggerating. Four hours ago is not an <i>eon</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Eon</i> goes back to the Greek <i>aiōn</i>, "age." An age is not easy to measure, and neither is an eon. Both are just really long periods of time, but in science an eon is about a billion years. You can use the noun <i>eon</i> for anything that takes a long while, including how long it will be before another planet collides with Earth or how many days until summer vacation starts — one is an eon, the other feels like an eon, or forever.</p></div>`;
