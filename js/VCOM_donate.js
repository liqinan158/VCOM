The word has a more altruistic meaning than does simply "giving"; it suggests that you don't expect anything in return for the contribution.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>donate</i> has always meant "to give," all the way back to the Latin verb <i>donāre</i>, "to give as a gift." Trace it back even further, to the ancient Indo-European roots, and you still have that same feeling to the word — "a gift." But it's more than a gift — it's a gift with the intention of helping. As an African proverb says, "If everybody in town donates one thread, the poor man has a shirt."</p></div>`;
