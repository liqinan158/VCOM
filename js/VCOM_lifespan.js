In many cases, larger animals have longer lifespans â€” while elephants can sometimes live to be 80, houseflies generally only have a lifespan of a few weeks. In Old English, <i>span</i> means "distance between the thumb and little finger," or "distance between objects." Eventually the word came to also mean "length of time."</p></div>`;
