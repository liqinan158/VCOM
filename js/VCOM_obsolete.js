As the Rolling Stones song "Out of Time" goes, "You're <i>obsolete</i>, my baby, my poor old-fashioned baby."</p><p class="long"><i>Obsolete</i> is from the Latin <i>obsolescere</i> "to fall into disuse," and it is a very handy adjective for anything that is no longer used, from words to factories to computer software to ways of thinking. Something that is obsolete has usually been displaced by a newer, shinier innovation. Compact discs made records and cassettes obsolete, and then downloadable digital music files made compact discs obsolete.</p></div></div>`;
