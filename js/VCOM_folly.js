It would be <i>folly</i> to spend all night playing video games when you have a difficult exam the next day.</p><p class="long"><i>Folly</i> comes from the Old French word <i>folie</i> meaning "madness, stupidity." It can describe the silly or nonsensical things you do, like the folly of trying to rush across town in the middle of a snowstorm. Or it can describe the trait that makes people act that way: the folly of an inexperienced driver who doesn't know you can't speed on snow-covered roads. Can you see the word <i>fool</i> in <i>folly</i>? Not a coincidence.</p></div>`;
