If your school requires that all students perform ten hours of community service, but you volunteer at the soup kitchen for twenty hours, that's <i>supererogation</i>.</p><p class="long">The Late Latin <i>supererogatio</i> means "a payment in addition," from <i>super</i>, "above or over" and <i>erogare</i>, "pay out." In English, this word was originally used in a religious context, for good works that go beyond what God requires. Today, supererogation typically describes an ethical or religious decision to act beyond what's required for being a good person: "Donating twenty percent of their income to charity is an act of supererogation."</p></div>`;
