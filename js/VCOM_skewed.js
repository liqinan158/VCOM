A picture frame or viewpoint can be <i>skewed</i>.</p><p class="long">This is a word, like so many, that can apply to physical things or ideas. A painting on the wall is skewed if it's leaning to one side. Also, opinions are often skewed: this is another way of saying someone is biased. People often accuse news reports of being skewed toward one political viewpoint. A movie could be skewed toward one character more than the other. When you think of <i>skewed</i>, think of leaning and slanting of all sorts.</p></div>`;
