When friends are heading to the movies and you want to go with them, you might say, "Can I also come?" That means you want to go along, too â€” in addition to the rest of the group. By starting a sentence with <i>also</i>, you're letting the reader know you're adding a thought, as in "I think pizza is delicious. Also, it's usually cheap and easy to eat on the run."</p></div>`;
