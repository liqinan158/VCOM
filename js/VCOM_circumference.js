The Latin word <i>circum</i> means “around,” and the root <i>ferre</i> is the Latin verb for “carry,” so imagine carrying a puppy around a circle pit of lava: the path you walk is the circumference.  If you want to buy a new hat, you’ll need to measure the circumference of your head, and patrolling the circumference of your castle is a good way to protect against dragons.</p></div>`;
