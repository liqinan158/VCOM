The noun is also used to suggest strength and resilience, and is sometimes used as a literary term for muscle, literal or metaphorical, as in “a nation’s <i>sinew</i>.”</p><p class="long"><i>Sinew</i> derives from before 900 CE, with relatives found in the Dutch <i>zenuw</i> and the Old High German <i>senawa</i>. Our present spelling worked its way through the Old English <i>seonowe</i> to become the Middle English <i>sinewe</i>. Aside from its anatomical meaning, this word is often used to present an image of strength and power, evident in filmmaker Ingmar Bergman’s statement, “I write scripts to serve as skeletons awaiting the flesh and sinew of images.”</p></div></div>`;
