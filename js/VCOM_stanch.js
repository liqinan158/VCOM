A bandage can <i>stanch</i> bleeding and thick towels can <i>stanch</i> the flow of water across the kitchen floor when you drop a full glass of water.</p><p class="long">The vowel sound in <i>stanch</i> most frequently sounds like <i>on</i>: "stonch." <i>Stanch</i> can also be pronounced to rhyme with <i>branch</i>. Though it's a verb mostly commonly associated with keeping blood from flowing from a wound, the origin is likely the Latin word <i>stagnum</i>, meaning "pond, pool." This word is related to <i>stagnate</i>, describing water that has no movement.</p></div></div>`;
