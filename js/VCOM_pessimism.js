It's the opposite of optimism, which means assuming the best. Most people feel that too much <i>pessimism</i> is paralyzing â€” who will ever try anything if they are always sure they will fail?</p><p class="long">Pessimism comes in two flavors. With one, you feel that something bad will happen. You feel <i>pessimistic</i> about the geometry final. How will you pass it? Pessimism is also the tendency to expect the worst in everything. A pessimist in love is a person sure that there must be something wrong with the person to love them back. A pessimist on an airplane is sure the plane is missing some essential part that won't be noticed until it plummets from the sky. Can pessimism be fun? Not really ever.</p></div></div>`;
