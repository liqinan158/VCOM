If you've spent time chatting with friends on the Internet, you've been in <i>cyberspace</i>.</p><p class="long">The official definition of <i>cyberspace</i> is fairly technical: "the notional environment in which communication over computer networks occurs." Since it was coined in 1982 by science fiction writer William Gibson, it's become more popular to use <i>cyberspace</i> to mean "online" or "on the Internet," especially when social interactions happen there. Cyberspace is the almost metaphorical place where two people, separately typing on their keyboards, meet and communicate.</p></div>`;
