Remember that Sesame Street song "One of these things is not like the other"? They were talking about that one thing being <i>incongruous</i>.</p><p class="long">If we break it down into its Latin roots, <i>incongruous</i> is formed by adding <i>in</i>, meaning “not," to <i>congruous</i>, which means “suitable, proper.” So, something that is incongruous is "not suitable or proper" — in other words, not in harmony with everything else. That's why burping at the dinner table could be called incongruous behavior: it's not proper and certainly doesn't go well with the main course.</p></div></div>`;
