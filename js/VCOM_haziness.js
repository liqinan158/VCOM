The <i>haziness</i> at sea today means that it will be difficult for you to navigate your sailboat.</p><p class="long">There's weather-related haziness, which is caused by water particles or dust and smoke, like the haziness you see in Los Angeles on hot days. There's also a figurative type of haziness that relates to anything vague or undefined: "The haziness of my memory makes me unsure if this happened in 2008 or 2009." The noun <i>haziness</i> stems from <i>hazy</i>, which we know has a nautical origin but is otherwise a mystery.</p></div></div>`;
