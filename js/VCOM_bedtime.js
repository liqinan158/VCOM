If you want a good excuse to leave a boring party, you can look at your watch and say, "Wow! It's way past my <i>bedtime</i>!"</p><p class="long">The time you generally go to bed is your bedtime, although you may not have a regular bedtime, just turning in whenever you feel sleepy. Most young children have a set bedtime, which is basically the hour their parents have decided they should go to sleep. If they're lucky, they'll get a bedtime story before the lights are turned off. <i>Bedtime</i> dates from the 13th century, from the Old English <i>bedd</i> and <i>tima</i>, "limited space of time."</p></div>`;
