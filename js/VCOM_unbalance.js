A sudden gust of wind might <i>unbalance</i> you when you're on a sailboat â€” don't forget to wear a life jacket!</p><p class="long">Throw something off balance, and you unbalance it. Tickling someone who's in a one-legged yoga stance will unbalance them, and leaning too far to one side will unbalance a new bike rider. You can also call this state of being out of kilter or wobbly <i>unbalance</i>: "The unbalance of the tightrope walker made me glad there was a net underneath him!" And figuratively, unbalance can also mean "disturb or upset."</p></div>`;
