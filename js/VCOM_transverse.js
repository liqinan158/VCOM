You might take a <i>transverse</i> path cutting across the park â€” it's a short cut if you're in a hurry, because you don't have to walk the entire length.</p><p class="long">First used in the 1590s, the adjective <i>transverse</i> comes from the Latin word <i>transvertere</i>, which combines the prefix <i>trans-</i>, meaning "across," and <i>vertere</i>, meaning "to turn." Something that's transverse cuts across something. A doctor may make a transverse incision into a patient's abdomen during an appendectomy.
