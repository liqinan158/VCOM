It's important to be confident at a job interview, but if you're <i>overconfident</i>, you may come across as downright rude.</p><p class="long">There's a fine line between confidence and overconfidence: being confident is attractive and appropriate. When someone seems overconfident, though, they appear to be unrealistically sure of themselves, more arrogant than poised. <i>Overconfident</i> combines the prefix <i>over-</i>, "too much," and <i>confident</i>, from the Latin <i>confidentem</i>, "firmly trusting or self-confident."</p></div>`;
