You can see many rocky <i>outcrops</i> throughout Shenandoah National Park in Virginia.</p><p class="long">The term <i>outcrop</i> and the alternative <i>outcropping</i> come from the "head or sprout" meaning of <i>crop</i>, from the idea of seeing the "head" of the rock below. Most of the earth's land surface is covered with soil and plants, but in areas where erosion has worn these away, you can see outcrops of the bedrock beneath. These outcrops can be low, flat sheets of rock, or taller rocky expanses along the edges of mountain ridges.</p></div></div>`;
