The back leg in an <i>arabesque</i> might be just touching the floor or extended straight up in the air.</p><p class="long">A ballet dancer in an arabesque position is familiar — many ballets include arabesques or arabesques penchée, when the ballerina's legs are at an angle greater than ninety degrees. Another kind of arabesque is a graceful design originally found in Islamic art and later in European art and design. This kind of arabesque resembles vines and leaves, rendered in metal, ceramic, or stone. The word <i>arabesque</i> comes from the Italian <i>Arabo</i>, or "Arab," used to describe Moorish architecture.</p></div>`;
