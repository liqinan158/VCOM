Or, they might be playing a game of dodgeball with the furniture.</p><p class="long"><i>Assailant</i> comes from the Latin <i>ad-</i> meaning "at" and <i>salire</i> meaning "to leap." Leap at someone and you're an assailant  â€” someone who attacks. You'll usually hear this word when lawyers or police are talking about attacks, because most people use its synonym <i>attacker</i> in casual conversation. Have you ever been attacked by ants, looking down to see your foot covered in them? Think of the word <i>ant</i> when you spell the word <i>assailant</i> to remember its ending.</p></div>`;
