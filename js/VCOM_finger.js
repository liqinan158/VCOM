Using your fingers, you can play the piano, speak in sign language, and flash a peace sign by forming a <i>V</i> with your first two fingers. As a verb, this word means to touch something with your fingers: "He nervously fingers his tie as he waits for his job interview." <i>Finger</i> stems from a root word meaning "five."</p></div>`;
