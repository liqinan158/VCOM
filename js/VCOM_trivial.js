It comes from the Latin word <i>trivium</i>: <i>tri</i> means "three" and <i>via</i> is "road." So a <i>trivium</i> is a "place where three roads meet," meaning a crossroads â€” just something ordinary. So something that is trivial is not worth remembering; it just isn't important.</p></div></div>`;
