Your favorite childhood stuffed animal might be made out of <i>velveteen</i>.</p><p class="long">Velvet is a plush fabric made of silk, and velveteen is a similar fabric that's made of cotton instead. Velveteen is less expensive and not quite as luxurious as velvet. Curtains, pillows, and clothing can all be made from velveteen. The word <i>velveteen</i> was coined in the 1770s, an alteration of the word <i>velvet</i>, which comes from the Latin <i>villutus</i>, or "shaggy cloth."</p></div></div>`;
