Some people think it’s a good idea to keep boys and girls <i>segregated</i> — or separated from each other — at school. Others believe that boys and girls should learn in the same classrooms.</p><p class="long">One person can be segregated from a group, as when a sick person is kept in isolation so others don’t become infected. Whole groups of people can also be segregated from each other. Since the late 1800s, <i>segregated</i> has been used in reference to the forced exclusion of African Americans from places where only whites were allowed, including schools, movie theaters, and train cars. The Latin root is <i>segregare</i>, "separated from the flock."</p></div></div>`;
