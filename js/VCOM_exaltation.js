Chances are slim, so don't bank on it.</p><p class="long"><i>Exaltation</i> comes from the Latin <i>exaltare</i> meaning to "raise aloft." When you're in a state of exaltation, your emotions are raised aloft and you're swept away in happiness. <i>Exaltation</i> is also the term for praising someone really highly or raising someone in rank, and for a group of larks, and in astrology, the place in a planet's orbit of maximum influence. Fly an exaltation of larks above the ceremony of your exaltation to Minister of Vocabulary.</p></div>`;
