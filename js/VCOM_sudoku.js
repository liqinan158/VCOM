Many newspapers print a <i>sudoku</i> each day, often next to the crossword. The word <i>sudoku</i> is Japanese for “single numbers.”</p><p class="long">A sudoku consists of a grid of 81 boxes, each of which is either blank or contains a single number. The trick is to write numbers in the blank boxes so that every digit from one to nine appears just once in each horizontal and vertical line. The origin is Japanese — <i>sūdoku</i> combines <i>sū(ji)</i>, "number," and <i>doku(shin)</i>, "single status." The game's original name was <i>sūji wa dokushin ni kagiru</i>, "the numbers are restricted to single status." Not quite as catchy.</p></div></div>`;
