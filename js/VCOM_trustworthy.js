var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">trustworthy</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Trustworthy</i> describes something you can believe in — it's completely reliable. Your favorite newspaper can be <i>trustworthy</i> — they always print the truth — and people can be <i>trustworthy</i> too. You only tell your secrets to a <i>trustworthy</i> friend.</p><p class="long">Breaking apart the word <i>trustworthy</i> gives you a clue to its meaning. It combines the common word <i>trust</i>, which describes something you can rely on, and the word <i>worthy</i>, which describes something that deserves respect. So something — or someone — that's trustworthy deserves your trust. In an election, you'll likely vote for the most <i>trustworthy</i> candidate because you believe she'll keep her promises. If you're trustworthy, that means you're reliable: you do what you say you're going to do.</p></div></div>`;
