If you've ever asked a friend for advice on what to wear, you were seeking their guidance. But guidance also applies to physical direction. We might use a global positioning system (GPS) for guidance when we drive. Years ago, sailors relied on the stars for guidance. Sherpas provide guidance to climbers hiking Mt. Everest so they don't get lost.</p></div>`;
