var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">attempt</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>attempt</i> is to make an effort. You may <i>attempt</i> to read a book, but if you fail, no harm. If you <i>attempt</i> to jump from one building to the next and fail . . . . Ouch.</p><p class="long">The word <i>attempt</i> can also be used as a noun. It's an honest effort to do something. Your attempt to bake a birthday cake may look like a disaster, but the birthday boy will appreciate the effort anyway. The noun <i>attempt</i> can also mean an attack on a person or place, but in this case, it's best to hope that the attempt is not on your life. And never, ever attempt that sort of thing at home!</p></div>`;
