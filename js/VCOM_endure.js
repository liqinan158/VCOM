Something you endure is always bad. And people are forever talking about what they can't or won't endure, as in "I refuse to <i>endure</i> any more abuse from my neighbors." <i>Endure</i> derives from the Latin <i>indūrāre</i> "to make hard," formed from the prefix <i>in-</i> "against, into" plus <i>dūrus</i> "hard."</p></div></div>`;
