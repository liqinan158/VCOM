You can use the verb <i>own</i> to describe possession of any kind of property, ranging from a saucepan to a fancy mansion.</p><p class="long">If something can be bought, it can be owned. You wouldn’t say that you own people or intangible objects. But you might own a car, for example, and if you’re lucky, you might own a lot of really cool shoes. <i>Own</i> can also be an adjective describing something that belongs to a particular person, like your own bedroom, or your own mind. If you admit to something, you "own up to it," admitting the responsibility belongs to you.</p></div></div>`;
