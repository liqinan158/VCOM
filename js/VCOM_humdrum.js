If a regular old photography class sounds too <i>humdrum</i>, you might instead sign up for Underwater Photography of Marine Predators. Don't forget your wetsuit!</p><p class="long">Anything that you can call <i>humdrum</i> is so severely lacking in variety and excitement that it's sure to make you <i>hum</i> and <i>drum</i> your fingers out of boredom. <i>Humdrum</i> is an adjective to describe the unglamorous monotony of everyday routines. It's the same old thing, again and again, over and over. <i>Humdrum</i> can also mean predictable, mind-numbing and not very challenging â€” hopefully the complete opposite of your social life.</p></div>`;
