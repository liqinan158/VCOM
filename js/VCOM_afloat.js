When you sail toy boats, you set them <i>afloat</i> across a pond or lake.</p><p class="long">You can set something afloat, like an inner tube in a pool or a leaf on a stream, or you can struggle to stay afloat, as when the passengers of a capsized boat try to keep their heads above water. In either case, being <i>afloat</i> means floating on the surface. The Old English word is <i>aflote</i>, from a Germanic root word.</p></div></div>`;
