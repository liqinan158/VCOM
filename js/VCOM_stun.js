So getting hit in the head with a softball will <i>stun</i> you, but hearing that your favorite band is playing at the prom will also <i>stun</i> you.</p><p class="long">If your cat catches a mouse, it may only stun the little animal and give you a chance to set it free. Being knocked hard enough in the head is generally what it takes to physically stun a person. It's more common for something that's astonishing to stun you, whether it's hearing terrible news or seeing something amazingly beautiful, like the northern lights or the Grand Canyon. <i>Stun</i>, in fact, shares a root with <i>astonish</i>.</p></div>`;
