In a fairy tale, a group of ogres might underestimate a knight who shows up on the field with rusty armor and an unburnished sword â€” until he single-handedly defeats them all. This adjective is formed by adding the prefix <i>un-</i>, meaning "opposite of," to <i>burnished</i>, "polished, glowing, or cleaned to a shine."</p></div>`;
