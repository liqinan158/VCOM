When you're on the receiving end of <i>criticism</i>, you are being judged in a disapproving way.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>criticism</i> is most often used to describe negative commentary about something or someone, but it's just as correct to use <i>criticism</i> to mean "an examination or judgment." Critics who review books and movies consider their reviews to be criticism, whether they're positive or negative. So the criticism you receive doesn't have to be all about your faults; it can actually be a pleasant experience.</p></div>`;
