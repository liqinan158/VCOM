Burning a candle is an <i>exothermic</i> process, since heat is given off.</p><p class="long">The scientific adjective <i>exothermic</i> is good for describing reactions that involve releasing energy, usually in the form of heat. Exothermic processes vary from something as simple as striking a match on a rough surface to a more extreme and violent example â€” an explosion. Part of what defines an exothermic reaction is that more energy is released than was required to start it. The word's Greek roots are <i>exo</i>, "outside," and <i>therme</i>, "heat."</p></div>`;
