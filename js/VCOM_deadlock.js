You can easily remember the meaning of this compound word, by thinking about its two word parts — <i>dead</i> + <i>lock</i>. The first appearance of <i>deadlock</i> was in <i>The Critic</i>, a play by Richard Brinsley Sheridan: “I have them all at a <i>deadlock</i>, for every one of them is afraid to let go first.”</p></div>`;
