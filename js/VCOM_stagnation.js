The stagnation of water can be a serious problem in parts of the world where mosquitoes spread diseases like malaria, or where there is a shortage of drinkable water. There are also other kinds of stagnation, or inactivity â€” like a struggling country's economic stagnation or a writer's mental stagnation that results in writer's block.</p></div>`;
