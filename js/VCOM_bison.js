Bison tend to travel in herds and periodically wallow in dirt to keep themselves cool and free of parasites, and while they're generally slow-moving, they can run as fast as 35 miles per hour when they want to. The word <i>bison</i> is Latin for "wild ox," ultimately from a Slavic or Baltic root meaning "the stinking animal."</p></div>`;
