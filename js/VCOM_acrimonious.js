That's an <i>acrimonious</i> situation that might result in fists flying unless you and your opponent can cool down.</p><p class="long">If you're familiar with the adjective <i>acrid</i>, which means "having a strongly unpleasant taste or smell," you might guess that <i>acrimonious</i> probably refers to something unpleasant, too. And you'd be right. Until the mid-nineteenth century, <i>acrimonious</i> meant the same thing as <i>acrid</i>. But while <i>acrid</i> is still most commonly used in a literal sense (as in "an acrid odor"), <i>acrimonious</i> is now used to describe things like angry and bitter speeches or debates. Both words come to English from the Latin word <i> acer</i>, meaning "sharp." Keep sharp objects locked up if a showdown gets too acrimonious.</p></div></div>`;
