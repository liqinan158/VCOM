In an English essay, you could <i>adumbrate</i> the themes in a novel; or, in a letter to Santa, you could <i>adumbrate</i> all the ways you have been behaving.</p><p class="long"><i>Adumbrate</i> is built on the Latin root <i>umbra</i>, "shade," and the image it evokes is of a shadow being cast around something. Your outline is like a shadow of something bigger â€” like the themes in that novel or the ways you have been behaving. You can also use <i>adumbrate</i> to mean "foreshadow": "The scene where the princess dreams of the vampire <i>adumbrates</i> her later discovery that her little brother is, in fact, a vampire."</p></div></div>`;
