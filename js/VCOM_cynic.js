They like to criticize people and situations, especially if they think there’s a deeper motivation behind the more obvious one.  Let’s say a friend borrows your car, and then he shows up later covered in grease and offers you a lollipop.  If you’re a cynic, you’d suspect that your friend crashed your car and is trying to distract you with the delicious and sweet lollipop.  And you might be right.</p></div>`;
