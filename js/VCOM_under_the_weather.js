It can also be a good excuse: "I'm sorry I can't visit your grandmother with you, but I'm a bit <i>under the weather</i> today."</p><p class="long">There is one popular theory about the origin of <i>under the weather</i> that connects it with sailing. Supposedly, when a sailor wasn't feeling well, he would retreat below deck, out of the "weather" above, where he could be described as <i>under the weather</i>. Other experts aren't sure about this explanation and suspect the phrase has more to do with the old idea that the weather has a strong effect on people's health.</p></div></div>`;
