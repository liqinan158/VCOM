You might use a <i>saucepan</i> to cook sauce, or for the macaroni from your box of macaroni and cheese.</p><p class="long">Saucepans are made out of various materials, from stainless steel and aluminum to copper and enamel-coated metal. If you have a kitchen, it's pretty likely you have a saucepan. They are deep enough to boil water in, and made to be used on top of a flame or electric coil. As you might guess from the name, the first saucepans, invented in the 17th century, were intended only for making sauces.</p></div></div>`;
