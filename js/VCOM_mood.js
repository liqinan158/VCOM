Don't ask, though, if he or she is "in a <i>mood</i>" - that means the person is grumpy. If you are in the mood for something like ice cream or spicy food, you would like to have it now. <i>Mood</i> can also describe the attitude of a group of people or the feeling of a film, novel or piece of music.</p></div>`;
