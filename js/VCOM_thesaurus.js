Roget had severe depression, and one of the ways he coped was to put his list-making and lexicographical (word analyzing) skills to use in a reference book that would group words, not alphabetically, but according to how similar their meanings were. This being the middle of the 19th century, there were no computers: Roget compiled and sorted all of his lists by hand.</p></div>`;
