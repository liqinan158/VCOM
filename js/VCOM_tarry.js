If you really like going to Sally’s Diner for dessert, you might <i>tarry</i> over coffee and end up leaving after they’ve closed the kitchen.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>tarry</i> is perfect for describing what happens when those relatives that you see once a year come to your house for lunch and never seem to leave. When people tarry they stick around and take a long time to depart, sometimes lurking or loitering, or sometimes enjoying each other's company. <i>Tarry</i> can also mean to hang around a place without purpose. You might tarry in the park until the day is fading and you have to go home.</p></div>`;
