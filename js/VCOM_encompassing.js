An island, for example, sits in the midst of <i>encompassing</i> ocean waves.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>encompassing</i> can describe things that literally encircle something, and also things that are so extensive that they seem to do so. For example, an <i>encompassing</i> history of World War II would include everything about the period, including the Holocaust. <i>Encompassing</i> comes from the verb <i>encompass</i>, "surround and hold within," or "include comprehensively," from the roots <i>en-</i>, "put in," and <i>compass</i>, "space or circumference."</p></div></div>`;
