Your earliest pals are often the kids in your neighborhood or at school. As you get older, you have the chance to meet more pals â€” and when you're friendly with these pals and hang out with them, you can say you "<i>pal</i> around" with them. <i>Pal</i> is originally a Romany word meaning "brother," from the Sanskrit <i>bhrata</i>, also "brother."</p></div>`;
