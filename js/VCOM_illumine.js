var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">illumine</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>illumine</i> is to shine a light on something, literally or figuratively. Your desk lamp might <i>illumine</i> the page of your book, while the words you're reading <i>illumine</i> your mind.</p><p class="long">This literary term is a more poetic way of saying "illuminate," though its original meaning was the figurative "enlighten spiritually." It's a graceful verb to use when you're talking about light that shines or glows: "The dancing candlelight cheerfully illumines the dim room." It's also useful for describing ideas that spark an intellectual or spiritual understanding: "It's the first time I've read philosophy that truly illumines my perception."</p></div>`;
