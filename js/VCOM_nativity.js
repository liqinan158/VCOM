If you were born in Baltimore, you can say that's the location of your <i>nativity</i>.</p><p class="long">Being born is a person's nativity, but the noun is most frequently used when Christians talk specifically about the birth of Jesus Christ. If a new mother says, "My baby's <i>nativity</i> was beautiful!" people might not know what she means. <i>Nativity</i> comes from the French word <i>nativit√©</i>, which also means "birth." The Latin root word is <i>nativus</i>, "born or native."</p></div></div>`;
