Some people like chocolate milk, but you might prefer the unadulterated variety. The adjective <i>unadulterated</i> also means "without qualifications," and it can be used in a negative way to mean "complete and utter." You'd probably feel like an unadulterated idiot if you shocked yourself by sticking a knife in the toaster after being advised not to.</p></div></div>`;
