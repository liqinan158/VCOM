You might personalize your signature by adding a couple of <i>curlicues</i> to the first letter of your name.</p><p class="long">In design, architecture, and works of art, a curly spiral can be called a curlicue. The black wrought iron fence surrounding a rose garden may feature curlicues, and formal calligraphy, with its swirls and flourishes, is full of curlicues. This word is an Americanism based on <i>curly</i>, with the <i>cue</i> probably stemming from the French <i>queue</i>, "tail." An earlier — and more adorable — word with the same meaning was <i>curlie-wurlie</i>.</p></div>`;
