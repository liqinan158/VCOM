Without <i>bullets</i>, a gun is harmless.</p><p class="long">If someone talks about ammunition for a gun, they're talking about bullets. A bullet doesn't usually contain explosives but does its damage by penetrating whatever — or whomever — it hits. The Middle French source of <i>bullet</i> is <i>boulette</i>, "cannonball" or "small ball," from <i>boule</i>, "a ball," with its Latin root <i>bulla</i>, "round thing." To "bite the <i>bullet</i>" means to withstand an unpleasant but necessary situation, from the (possibly fictitious) practice of patients biting bullets during painful operations.</p></div></div>`;
