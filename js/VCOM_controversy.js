When a popular TV show kills off a well-loved character, there's bound to be a lot of <i>controversy</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Controversy</i> means a quarrel (often public) involving strong disagreement, but the topic can be as unimportant as a new movie. There might be a controversy in the pages of fashion magazines over whether shorter hems are really in style, or about wearing white after Labor Day. <i>Controversy</i> is from the Latin <i>contrōversus</i>, "turned in an opposite direction," from the prefix <i>contrā</i>, "against," plus <i>versus</i>, a form of <i>vertere</i>, "to turn."</p></div>`;
