It isn't part of what people are thinking or talking about. The opposite is relevant, meaning related. An analysis of brush strokes in Manet's painting would be relevant to a discussion of texture in painting in general. <i>Relevant</i> was borrowed from Medieval Latin <i>relevare</i> "to bear upon," from Latin, "to lift up." The prefix <i>ir-</i>, meaning "not," is a variant of <i>in-</i> before words that begin with the letter <i>r</i>.</p></div>`;
