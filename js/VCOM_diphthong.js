var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">diphthong</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>diphthong</i> is a sound made by combining two vowels, specifically when it starts as one vowel sound and goes to another, like the <i>oy</i> sound in <i>oil</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Diphthong</i> comes from the Greek word <i>diphthongos</i> which means "having two sounds." Notice the <i>di-</i> for "double." So diphthongs are double vowel sounds in words like <i>chair</i>, <i>fear</i>, or <i>pout</i>. If two vowels in a row are the same, as in <i>boot</i> or <i>beer</i>, then it's not a diphthong. Linguists, scholars who study language, analyze diphthongs, which differ from language to language. Ironically, the word <i>diphthong</i> has no diphthongs.</p></div>`;
