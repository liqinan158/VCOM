Visiting the zoo, you might find yourself wondering if the lions see the zookeepers as friends or as <i>captors</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>captor</i> sounds a little bit like <i>capture</i>, and it's no coincidence â€” they're both rooted in the Latin <i>capere</i>, "to take, hold, or seize." So if you capture a cricket and keep it in a little cage, you are its captor. And, when a police force captures a criminal and puts them in prison, the police become captors too. The original meaning of <i>captor</i> was actually "a censor."</p></div>`;
