A <i>verbose</i> book report goes on and on and is packed with long, complicated words that aren't at all necessary.</p><p class="long">If a friend asks, "Did you have fun at the party?" you can simply answer, "No." Or you can provide a verbose reply that describes just how much you hated the party, who was and wasn't there, the fact that you got lost on the way, the terrible food that was served, and the awful music that was played. <i>Verbose</i> is from Latin <i>verbosus</i> "full of words," from <i>verbum</i>, "word or verb." As you can guess from the spelling, the English <i>verb</i> is closely related.</p></div>`;
