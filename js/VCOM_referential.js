Many hip-hop songs are <i>referential</i>, using samples of other songs, mentioning them, or quoting them.</p><p class="long">Your experimental poetry is referential, if it points directly or more subtly to sources and influences like Shakespeare and Britney Spears and Dr. Seuss. An architect might describe her modern designs as referential too, if they allude to older building styles, using Gothic arches and flat, Art Deco roofs. In general, the adjective <i>referential</i> is a fancy way to talk about the references, mentions, and allusions someone (usually an artist) makes to other things.</p></div>`;
