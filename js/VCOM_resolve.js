A college's board of directors  might resolve to recruit more minority students. As a noun, <i>resolve</i> refers to a strong determination to do something.</p><p class="long">If you make a New Year's <i>resolution</i> to exercise every day, you'll need plenty of resolve to stick with your program. The verb descends from Middle English <i>resolven</i> "to dissolve," from Latin <i>resolvere</i> "to untie." In English, the obsolete sense of "to dissolve" can be seen in this line from Shakespeare: "O, that this too too solid flesh would melt, thaw, and <i>resolve</i> itself into a dew."</p></div>`;
