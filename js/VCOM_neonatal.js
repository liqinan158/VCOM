The <i>neonatal</i> period is that first month after a baby is born. There are also <i>neonatal</i> disorders that require <i>neonatal</i> care.</p><p class="long">Like many babies, the word <i>neonatal</i>'s parents are from different places — <i>neo</i> comes from Greek and means “new,” and <i>natal</i> comes from the Latin word <i>natus</i> which means “to be born.” <i>Neonatal</i> means newborn. The neonatal stage is the first month of life, when a baby is tiniest and most fragile. Babies born at a hospital who can’t come home right away sometimes stay in a neonatal intensive care unit, where neonatal nurses care for them.</p></div></div>`;
