You might often see it used with reference to diagnostic <i>modality</i>, which is the way in which a disease or illness is diagnosed by a doctor.</p><p class="long"><i>Modality</i> shares its root with the word <i>mode</i>, meaning "the way in which something happens or is experienced." A sensory modality is a way of sensing, like vision or hearing. Modality in someone's voice gives a sense of the person's mood. In logic, modality has to do with whether a proposition is necessary, possible, or impossible. In general, a modality is a particular way in which something exists.</p></div>`;
