Your old dog's <i>lameness</i> will make it hard for him to walk up stairs, and you'll probably end up carrying him.</p><p class="long">The word <i>lameness</i> is most often used to describe animals that are injured or ill and unable to walk without limping. For some animals, like horses, lameness is a sign of extreme pain and is considered a very serious symptom. Your puppy's lameness may be nothing more than a burr in her paw. <i>Lameness</i> and <i>lame</i> come from a Proto-Germanic word meaning "weak-limbed" or, literally, "broken."</p></div></div>`;
