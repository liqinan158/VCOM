If you’re an organized <i>sort</i> of person, <i>sort</i> your clothes by color. If you’re the disorganized <i>sort</i>, just chuck them all over the floor.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>sort</i> can mean a category or example, or even a type of person, as in "My sister is a generous <i>sort</i>." As a verb, it means "organize, categorize, or resolve" like when you sort your earrings by size or your math teacher helps you sort out what went wrong on the latest test. <i>Sort</i> comes from the Latin <i>sortem</i>, "share or portion" and also "fate or destiny."</p></div></div>`;
