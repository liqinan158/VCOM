If someone tells you "to go fly a <i>kite</i>," they want to get rid of you. If you follow their directions, however, you will end up having fun.</p><p class="long">When you fly a kite, you unspool your string as the kite catches a breeze and rises higher and higher in the air. Kites were first flown in China, most likely around the fifth century BCE. Another kind of <i>kite</i> is the small hawk famous in ancient Egyptian mythology as the animal form taken by Isis when she brought the dead back to life. The toy kite is named after the bird, since they both soar through the air.</p></div></div>`;
