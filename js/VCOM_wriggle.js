Think of how hard it is to hold a rambunctious puppy as it <i>wriggles</i> in your arms.</p><p class="long"><i>Wriggle</i> sounds a lot like <i>wiggle</i>, and the two words very nearly mean the same thing. There is a subtle difference, though: when you wriggle, you twist, turn, or bend as you move. When you wiggle, you make more of a back-and-forth motion. In fact, these two near-homonyms have completely different etymological sources. While <i>wiggle</i> stems from a Germanic root meaning "cradle," <i>wriggle</i>'s root means "to turn or bend."</p></div>`;
