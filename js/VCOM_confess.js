You might feel guilty about eating the entire platter of chocolate chip cookies and <i>confess</i> to your mom before she notices. If she presses charges, you would <i>confess</i> to the cookie crime.</p><p class="long"><i>Confess</i> can be used to describe admitting to committing a crime. If you watch crime shows on TV, you've likely seen detectives trying to get a suspect to confess. <i>Confess</i> can also be used in a religious context. Catholics <i>confess</i> their sins to a priest on a regular basis. Don't confuse the word <i>confess</i> with <i>apology</i>. An apology involves expressing regret about something. When you confess, you're merely owning up to doing it â€” you might not be sorry.</p></div></div>`;
