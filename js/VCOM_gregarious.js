Not surprisingly, people began using it to describe humans who liked being in groups. Today biologists still speak of <i>gregarious species</i>, but you're more likely to hear it in reference to people. Despite what you might suspect, it has no historical connection to the name <i>Gregory</i> — but if you know an outgoing fellow with that name, you could call him Greg-arious.</p></div></div>`;
