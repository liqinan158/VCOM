A district attorney will often prosecute, by bringing legal charges and action against a person or group (watch any TV legal drama, and the prosecution will no doubt prosecute eventually). A company may prosecute by suing to protect against damages. <i>Prosecute</i> should not be confused with the word <i>persecute</i>, which means to harass or oppress.</p></div>`;
