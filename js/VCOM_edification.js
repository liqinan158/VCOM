It means it's designed to improve you in some way, whether morally, educationally, or spiritually.</p><p class="long">Originally <i>edification</i> had a strictly religious sense, in the meaning of "building up of the soul," from the Latin term <i>aedificationem,</i> for "construction" or "building." From the same word we get <i>edifice,</i> meaning a building, especially a large and imposing one. So, you see, edification is all about efforts to build you into a more sound human being. Children can have a particular dislike for TV shows or books that are considered edifying by their parents or teachers.</p></div>`;
