An asthmatic is someone with asthma, but the word is also used to describe things related to asthma. An inhaler — which helps an asthmatic breathe — could be called asthmatic medicine. An asthmatic attack is a severe lack of breath. You can also say someone sounds asthmatic if they have a breathy, wheezing voice. Anyone who is out of breath sounds a little asthmatic.</p></div>`;
