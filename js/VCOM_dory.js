Most <i>dories</i> are found in the deepest waters of the ocean.</p><p class="long">The term <i>dory</i> includes fish from several different families. One thing they all have in common is their silvery color, which explains their name, rooted in the Middle French <i>doree</i> or "gilded one." Another kind of <i>dory</i> is a small, light fishing boat. A dory typically has a flat bottom and wide planks on its sides, and is designed to carry a large, heavy load, especially considering its small size.</p></div>`;
