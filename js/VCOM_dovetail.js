You can also use the word <i>dovetail</i> to show how other things fit well together — like how your picnic plans nicely <i>dovetail</i> with the sunny forecast.</p><p class="long">A well-made dovetail is a beautiful thing, with wooden projections that slide into notches perfectly, the two sides forming a corner. When things fit this way, you can say they <i>dovetail</i> — they fit easily and work well together. Your plan to dress up as a Jedi knight dovetails well with your brother's Darth Vader costume, for example. <i>Dovetails</i> got their name from the tail feather-like shape of the joint's pieces.</p></div>`;
