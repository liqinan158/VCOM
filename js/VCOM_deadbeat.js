If someone went to a restaurant and didn't pay, the manager might say "You <i>deadbeat</i>!" If you don't pay a cable or phone bill, you're a deadbeat. A roommate who doesn't pay their share of the rent is a deadbeat. People often talk about deadbeat dads who abandon their children and don't pay child support. A more formal word for a deadbeat is <i>defaulter</i>.</p></div>`;
