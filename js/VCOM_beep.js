You might give a quick <i>beep</i> on your car horn to let a bicyclist know you're passing her on the road.</p><p class="long">Your friend's voice mail might say, "Leave a message after the <i>beep</i>!" and your smoke alarm might emit an annoying series of beeps when its battery is dying. In either case, you'll hear a high-pitched, brief tone. The word is imitative — it sounds like what it means — and relatively new, only as old as the car horns it imitates. <i>Beep</i> was first an interjection in the 1920s, and a noun and a verb by the end of the decade.</p></div>`;
