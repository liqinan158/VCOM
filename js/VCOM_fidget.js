Even if you're nervous during your job interview, try not to <i>fidget</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>fidget</i> is related to the Old Norse <i>fikja</i>, meaning "move briskly, be restless or eager." If you are feeling impatient or anxious you might fidget in your seat or fidget with a pen in your hands. A person who fidgets a lot can be referred to as a fidget and so can that quick anxious movement itself.</p></div></div>`;
