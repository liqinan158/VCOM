Whether it's alcohol or ideas, the <i>distilled</i> part is the most powerful.</p><p class="long">The original meaning of <i>distill</i> comes from the process of making alcohol, known as <i>distilling,</i> in which all the impurities of a substance are vaporized and its pure, high-alcohol condensation collected. <i>Distill</i> eventually came to mean any process in which the essence of something is revealed. If you take notes at a lecture and then turn them into an essay for your professor, you're distilling your notes into something more pure and exact. At least, that's what you hope you're doing.</p></div>`;
