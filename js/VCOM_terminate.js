Full stop.</p><p class="long">In ancient Rome, Terminus was the God of landmarks, boundaries, and endings. That’s why his annual party took place at the end of the year.  You can imagine the guests walking around in their togas, going, “This party is so great, I wish it would never <i>terminate</i>.” Nowadays, <i>terminate</i> can be used to refer to bringing anything to an end — including one's job or a product line: "When the Weird Food Company announces plans to <i>terminate</i> production of its deep-fried chocolate-covered pickle line, it will be a sad day for lovers of strange snacks."</p></div>`;
