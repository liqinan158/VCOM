If you <i>nag</i> your parents long enough, they'll either give in and get you a puppy, or simply refuse any pets at all â€” not even a goldfish.</p><p class="long">When you nag someone, you complain and pester them. Your teacher might nag you about a late assignment, or you might nag your friend to give you back the sweater he borrowed. A thought or worry can also nag you, simply by staying in your thoughts. The word <i>nag</i> meant "gnaw" before the 1820s, from a Scandinavian root.</p></div></div>`;
