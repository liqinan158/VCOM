It might be red or yellow in various sizes, and comes in shapes from round to pear-shaped.</p><p class="long">Since the tomato is native to South America, it makes sense that its name is based in the Spanish <i>tomate</i>, and can be traced to the Aztecs, whose language, Nahuatl, contained the word <i>tomatl</i>, or "the swelling fruit." In 1519, Cortez brought tomato seeds to Spain, where the plant was grown as an ornament but not for eating. The French called them <i>pommes d'amour</i>, or “love apples,” and in 1929 the word became American slang for a pretty girl.</p></div>`;
