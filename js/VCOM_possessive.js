For example, you're being possessive of your pooch if you won't let anyone else play with it. A friend might be possessive of you if they get jealous when you hang out with other people. But in grammar, <i>possessive</i> is less creepy: a possessive word indicates ownership, like the word “dog's” in the sentence "Your dog's bowl just spilled on the carpet."</p></div></div>`;
