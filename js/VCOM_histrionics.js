Itâ€™s like putting on a little show to get attention.</p><p class="long">Histrionics originally referred to acting in a play, and it still conveys a sense of pretending. If someone is going through histrionics, they're acting outlandish, usually to get sympathy or influence someone. Exaggerated crying, unnecessary yelling, and overdone gestures are all examples of histrionics. Unlike real emotional reactions, histrionics are fake and intended to manipulate others.</p></div>`;
