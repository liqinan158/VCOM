The wheel and axle of a <i>pulley</i> make it easier to lift heavy objects with the rope.</p><p class="long">Ships and sailboats use pulleys — though they're often called <i>drums</i> — to make raising the sails less difficult. Flagpoles also have pulleys for raising and lowering the flag, many garage doors work by a pulley system, and loading docks and constructions sites use pulleys for lifting heavy things. <i>Pulley</i> comes from the Old French <i>polie</i>, with a Greek root of <i>polidion</i>, or "little pivot."</p></div></div>`;
