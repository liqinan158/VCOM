A <i>grasshopper</i> can use its long legs to leap up to 20 times its own body length â€” that's pretty impressive for a bug!</p><p class="long">Grasshoppers are related to crickets and katydids. The origin of the word <i>grasshopper</i> is instantly clear once you see a grassy field full of these leaping insects. The insects "chirp" by rubbing their legs against their wings. In some parts of the world, grasshoppers are eaten by humans, and they are often viewed as pests because of their appetite for grains. Swarms of grasshoppers have at various times been responsible for the destruction of entire fields of crops.</p></div>`;
