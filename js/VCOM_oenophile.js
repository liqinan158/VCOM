Once you've tasted all the oaky tannins and hints of red fruit, you can finally swallow. Oenophiles drink wine, discuss wine, keep wine in the cellar, and know which years produced the best wine. Don't confuse oenophiles with <i>winos</i>, another name for alcoholics who like cheap wine. Oenophiles prefer to savor the good stuff.</p></div></div>`;
