Perhaps you have a <i>bent</i> for  woodworking, creating fabulous desserts, or writing poetry, you are good at it.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>bent</i> can also refer to a strong inclination to react to something in a specific manner. If you have a strong scientific bent, you won't be inclined to believe reports of alien spaceship landings and Loch Ness Monster sightings. As an adjective, <i>bent</i> describes someone very determined, and in this case, the word is usually followed by "on." You may be bent on the kids going to bed early, but they may have other ideas: party in the living room!</p></div>`;
