var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">uniparous</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">An animal that only gives birth to one baby at a time, like an elephant, can be described as <i>uniparous</i>.</p><p class="long">Human beings are usually uniparous, though they occasionally have twins, triplets, or even more babies at once. You're most likely to come across a description of an animal as uniparous in a zoology class, although it's sometimes used to describe a woman who has only had one child in her lifetime. In either case, the prefix <i>uni</i>, or "one" in Latin, gives a clue to the word's meaning. <i>Parous</i> comes from the Latin <i>parere</i>, "to produce or bring forth."</p></div>`;
