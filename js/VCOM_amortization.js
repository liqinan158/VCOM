Amortization takes place over a specific period of time. The root of <i>amortization</i> can be traced to the Middle English word <i>amortisen</i>, meaning “to kill.” In this case, it’s a debt that’s being killed off — slowly, over time. The word is often applied to car or home loans.</p></div></div>`;
