In Arabic, they're known as <i>sagat</i> or <i>sajat</i>. Belly dancers wear four zills on their hands, one on each thumb and one on each middle finger. The dancers accompany traditional Middle Eastern music with both their zills and their dancing bodies â€” if you've been lucky enough to try belly dancing, you know how incredibly challenging that is!</p></div></div>`;
