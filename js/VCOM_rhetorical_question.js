Imagine your brother is blasting his music and you ask, "Could you play that music any louder?" You don't really expect him to answer — you just want him to turn it down.</p><p class="long">When something is rhetorical that means it is made for style or effect, likewise a rhetorical question is a question that is asked for mere effect, rather than a question that needs to be answered. Questions like “Who knew?” or “Who's better than me?” are often rhetorical. If someone asks a question when they actually do want an answer but they are not getting any response, you might hear them say, “It’s not a <i>rhetorical question</i>; I want an answer.”</p></div>`;
