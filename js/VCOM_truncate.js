You can <i>truncate</i> a board that is too long using a power saw, a chain saw, or perhaps even a karate kick.</p><p class="long">The word <i>truncate</i> is from a Latin word, <i>truncare</i>, which means "to maim or to cut off." Although this brings to mind a more grisly image ("<i>truncate</i> a limb in an accident"), you can actually truncate things that are not related to anatomy. You could truncate an essay by omitting a paragraph or two, or you could even truncate your vacation in Belize by heading home early.</p></div></div>`;
