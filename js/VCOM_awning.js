If you walk down a street with a lot of stores and it starts raining, you'll probably try to stay under the <i>awnings</i>.</p><p class="long">An awning provides shelter from rain and sun. You will often see awnings extending over the entryways of businesses. Under an awning is a place you can hang out as you collapse your umbrella on your way in, or as you open your umbrella on your way out. Awnings are often made from some type of canvas, and they protrude from the top of the store or building, kind of like the brim of a cap, which has a similar function.</p></div>`;
