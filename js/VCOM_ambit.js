The kid who's voted president of her sixth grade class is going to be thrilled, despite her relatively small <i>ambit</i>.</p><p class="long">The origins of <i>ambit</i> go back to the Latin word for "going about or going round," <i>ambitus</i>, and for a time, <i>ambit</i> literally meant "the area surrounding a building." Today, the range of a person or group's power is their ambit. For example, if a crime is committed on a college campus, the town police won't investigate if they decide that it's the ambit of the college police, or under their jurisdiction.</p></div>`;
