After wearing flip flops every day, all summer long, you'll probably have a <i>callus</i> between your toes.</p><p class="long">If you get a blister from playing tennis or digging in the garden, it will eventually turn into a callus if you keep swinging your racquet or using your trowel. Any spot on your skin that's rubbed and irritated repeatedly becomes a callus, or a thickened patch of skin. In medicine, another kind of callus is the bony tissue that forms when a broken bone heals. Don't confuse <i>callus</i> with <i>callous</i> â€” which sounds the same but means "insensitive and cruel."</p></div></div>`;
