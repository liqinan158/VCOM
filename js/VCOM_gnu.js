A <i>gnu</i> (the "g" is silent) is a large animal with hooves that's found in the southernmost part of Africa. You can see <i>gnus</i> in zoos.</p><p class="long">A gnu is the same thing as a wildebeest â€” <i>gnu</i> comes from the Dutch <i>gnoe</i>, which has roots in the Khoisan <i>i-ngu</i> and the Southern Bushman <i>!nu:</i> (with the <i>!</i> and <i>:</i> representing clicks). Gnus are related to antelopes, sharing their long legs, curved horns, and hooves. The official term for a group of gnus is a herd, although many writers prefer the unofficial term "an implausibility of gnus."</p></div></div>`;
