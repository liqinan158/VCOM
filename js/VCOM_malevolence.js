When you're full of <i>malevolence</i>, you wish harm on others.</p><p class="long">Translated from the Latin, malevolence means to wish for bad things â€” to have ill will. What sets <i>malevolence</i> apart from other kinds of hatefulness is that it implies a deliberate wish for evil. A small child might be mean out of anger or spite, but probably not out of malevolence. Malevolence requires more thought: it's a deeper, more profound kind of badness often associated with devils and villains.</p></div>`;
