For example, you can often <i>rejuvenate</i> a not-quite-dead plant, bringing it back to health with some water and some TLC.</p><p class="long">One way to remember the word <i>rejuvenate</i> is to pick it apart to its heart, the <i>juve</i>. This <i>juve</i> sounds like <i>juvenile</i> — which refers to youth. Add the prefix <i>re</i>, which means "again," and the "ate" suffix, which stands for "do or make." Put them all together and you get "make young again" — the meaning of <i>rejuvenate</i>. We all want to be younger, as witnessed by all the ads for products that promise to rejuvenate us through special cosmetics or foods or exercise equipment.</p></div>`;
