If you try to make wings and fly off the roof but wind up crashing in the gutter, there's a <i>flaw</i> in your plan.</p><p class="long">In the early 14th century, when the noun <i>flaw</i> was first recorded, it referred to a snowflake or spark of fire. That sense is now obsolete, and now we use <i>flaw</i> to describe shortcomings in either character or object. We all have flaws. It can also describe an intentional mark of imperfection. “You see,” said the dancer Martha Graham, “when weaving a blanket, an Indian woman leaves a flaw in the weaving of that blanket to let the soul out.”</p></div></div>`;
