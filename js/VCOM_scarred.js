The <i>scarred</i> wooden floors in the old school show that generations of kids have walked on them.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>scarred</i> describes something that's been hurt and shows some physical evidence of it. Your battle-scarred tabby cat might be missing a few whiskers and have a couple of nicks in his ears, and your knees might be scarred from falling off your bike. You can even be scarred in non-physical but lasting and serious ways, like being emotionally scarred by a breakup or a friend's betrayal. Being scarred this way might make you more cautious in the future.</p></div>`;
