You can pack your duds in a suitcase before a vacation or arrange your duds by color in your closet. Though experts aren't sure where the word <i>duds</i> came from originally, they know that it was <i>dudde</i> in the 1300s, which meant "cloak or mantle," and later came to be <i>duddes</i> and to mean "ragged clothing."</p></div></div>`;
