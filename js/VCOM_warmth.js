You'll enjoy the warmth of a car's heated seats when you climb in after sledding for hours, as well as the warmth of a big mug of hot chocolate in your hands once you're home. Besides this literal heat-related warmth, there's also the figurative warmth of kindness and good feelings: "The warmth of my mom's smile makes everyone feel at home."</p></div>`;
