You can see this in political parties: the groups that make up the whole of voters in a nation. <i>Party</i> also means "person or group," which we are reminded of at restaurants when asked, "How many are in your party?" This is how <i>party</i> as in "a social gathering" or as a verb — the act of enjoying yourself at such a gathering — came about.</p></div>`;
