"He didn't mean to peek, but he got a <i>glimpse</i> of his birthday present when his wife tried to sneak it into the house. Of course, it's pretty hard to hide a ladder."</p><p class="long">You can use <i>glimpse</i> as a noun (like when you "catch a glimpse of someone") or as a verb (like when you "glimpse in someone's direction"). Although the word <i>glimpse</i> is usually used to describe the physical act of sneaking a peek at something, you can also use the noun <i>glimpse</i> to indicate a vague idea or suggestion. Perhaps, you can have a glimpse into your future by observing your parents' actions or by consulting a Tarot card reader.</p></div></div>`;
