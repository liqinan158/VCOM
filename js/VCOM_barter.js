An individual might trade, for example, a cow in exchange for help building a shed, or a dozen eggs in exchange for several yards of cloth. To this day people continue to barter for goods and services although this method of commerce is no longer widespread. The verb <i>barter</i> has survived into modern times to refer to making a transaction that involves the exchange of goods or services rather than money.</p></div>`;
