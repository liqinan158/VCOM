Designers and dressmakers often use <i>muslin</i> to make inexpensive sample garments for fitting.</p><p class="long">Perfecting designs using muslin is so common that the practice garment itself is often referred to as a <i>muslin</i>: "Here, try on this muslin before we cut the pattern out of the silk." The word <i>muslin</i> comes from the French <i>mousseline</i>, which is rooted in <i>Mosul</i>, the city in Iraq where Western traders first encountered the fabric. This ancient muslin was a luxurious material, while today's is much more ordinary and affordable.</p></div>`;
