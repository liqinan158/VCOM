The meaning stems from the tiny, hairlike diameter of a capillary. While <i>capillary</i> is usually used as a noun, the word also is used as an adjective, as in "<i>capillary</i> action," in which a liquid is moved along — even upward, against gravity — as the liquid is attracted to the internal surface of the capillaries.</p></div>`;
