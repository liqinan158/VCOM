If you <i>dismantle</i> a computer to see what it looks like inside, you better know how to put it back together, or you might be looking at the inside of your room for awhile.</p><p class="long"><i>Dismantle</i> is a verb used for both physical things and ideas. You can dismantle a campground by taking down the tents and breaking apart the fire logs, or you can dismantle a government by going against its leadership and bringing down its rule. Often when you <i>dismantle</i> something, you take away its ability to work, as with a nuclear warhead, but you can also take apart decorative or non-working things, as when you dismantle a science-fair display or a city made of blocks.</p></div></div>`;
