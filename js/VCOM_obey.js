In the old days, all of a monarchy's citizens were expected to <i>obey</i> the commands of their king or queen.</p><p class="long">You might be expected to obey the rules your strict parents lay down, or to obey the guidelines of a group or club you belong to. Religious Christians obey God, and soldiers obey the direct orders their commanding officers give them. To <i>obey</i> is to be <i>obedient</i>, and both words come from the Latin <i>obedire</i>, which literally means "listen to," but is used to mean "pay attention to."</p></div></div>`;
