Otherwise, our writing is full of lowercase letters. Every letter in the alphabet has an uppercase and lowercase version, the latter being mainly smaller and shorter on a printed page. In typography, capital letters are all the same height, while the size of lowercase letters varies (think of an <i>a</i> compared with a <i>j</i>, for example).</p></div>`;
