When police officers don't let citizens videotape arrests, or a society doesn't allow girls to attend school, it's repressive. Someone growing up in a repressive family might feel cautious about saying or doing the wrong things. The adjective <i>repressive</i> comes from the Latin root <i>repressus</i>, "held back or curbed," and also "checked or restrained."</p></div></div>`;
