Sufism is less a sect or split from Islam, and more of an aspect of the Islamic religion â€” Sufis also consider themselves to be Muslim, and like any devout Muslim, they pray five times a day and follow the teachings of Muhammad. Sufism simply includes more mysticism and rituals, like the spinning dance done by "whirling dervishes." In Arabic, <i>Sufi</i> means "man of wool."</p></div>`;
