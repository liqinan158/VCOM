Your sloppy brother might keep all of his clothes in a <i>heap</i> on his bedroom floor.</p><p class="long">A <i>heap</i> can be a literal mound of things — a heap of money in your piggy bank, or a heap of wet towels beside the pool — or it can be a figurative pile. For example, you might worry that if you're caught eating your roommate's pizza you'll be in a heap of trouble. <i>Heap</i> is also a verb, as when you heap compliments on your best friend. Since 1924 <i>heap</i> has also meant "junky old car."</p></div>`;
