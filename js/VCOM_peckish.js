If you're <i>peckish</i>, you're a tad hungry (not starving, but hungry enough to poke around the kitchen cabinets).</p><p class="long">While the informal word <i>peckish</i> is more common in the UK, most people in North America will know what you mean if you say, "I'm feeling a little <i>peckish</i> — should we make some popcorn?" Some people wake up in the morning feeling peckish, while others don't feel like eating for a few hours. <i>Peckish</i> comes from the verb <i>peck</i>, which a bird does when it bites with its beak — it basically means "hungry enough to peck at some food."</p></div>`;
