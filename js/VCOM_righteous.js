If the answer is yes, you are <i>righteous</i> â€” in the right.</p><p class="long">Being righteous literally means to be right, especially in a moral way. Religious people often talk about being righteous. In their view, the righteous person not only does the right thing for other people but also follows the laws of their religion. Heroes like Martin Luther King are often called righteous. On the other hand, this word can be a little negative. If you call someone <i>self-righteous</i>, it means they're a little too sure they're right and better than other people.</p></div></div>`;
