var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">gadfly</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>gadfly</i> is an irritating person, a nuisance who will often ask too many questions or lob lots of criticisms in order to get his or her way.</p><p class="long"><i>Gadfly</i> can also refer to an actual fly. The next time you see a cow swatting at the air with her tail, look closer because she might actually be shooing away an annoying <i>gadfly</i>. This is any kind of fly that likes to pester, and even bite, livestock. The prefix <i>gad</i> is an old word for “spike” or “pointed stick” which can be thought of, in this case, as similar to a stinger. So if your office mate is continuously buzzing around your desk with stinging comments, call him a <i>gadfly</i> and try to shoo him back to his own desk.</p></div>`;
