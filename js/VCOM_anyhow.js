You could say, for example, "I won't be going for a run today, not if it's as hot as yesterday <i>anyhow</i>." Another way to use <i>anyhow</i> is to mean "in a haphazard way" or "randomly." Your mom might complain that people just toss things in the fridge anyhow. The word has been used in American English since the mid-1700s.</p></div></div>`;
