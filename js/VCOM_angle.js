Then you'll remember measuring the <i>angle</i> or space between two intersecting lines in degrees. If you recall that a right <i>angle</i> measures ninety degrees, give yourself a bonus.</p><p class="long"><i>Angle</i> can also mean a biased way of looking at or presenting something. Talk radio stations, for example, often discuss current events with a "political <i>angle</i>." On a far more peaceful note, to <i>angle</i> also means simply to fish, both in the literal sense of trying to catch a fish on a hook or in the metaphorical sense of trying to subtly obtain something without being seen to do so directly, as in, "I'm going to angle for a promotion at work."</p></div></div>`;
