Even if it's barely raining as you walk from the bus stop, the <i>wetness</i> of your shirt might make you want to change your clothes once you get home.</p><p class="long">Wetness is caused by some kind of moisture, whether it's the wetness on your cheeks as you watch a really sad movie or the wetness of your bathing suit after you swim across the lake. The wetness of your basement means it's not a good place to store books and papers, and the wetness of the spring — one rainy day after another — means the summer will be lush and green, and you're likely to see moisture-loving mushrooms popping up everywhere.</p></div></div>`;
