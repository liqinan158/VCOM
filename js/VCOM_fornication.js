In some religions, <i>fornication</i> is considered a sin.</p><p class="long">This is not the kind of word friends use when sitting around talking about sex. This is an old-fashioned word that you can definitely spot in the Bible and other holy books, because it refers to sex that is considered wrong because it is not between a man and a wife. So in the original sense, <i>fornication</i> is a synonym for <i>adultery</i>. But people also humorously use <i>fornication</i> to mean any kind of sex at all.</p></div></div>`;
