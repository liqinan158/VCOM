If you and your girlfriend announce your <i>troth</i> at a family dinner, then that means you better be serious about your relationship.</p><p class="long">You can pronounce <i>troth</i> to rhyme with "cloth" or to rhyme with "oath." In fact, <i>oath</i> is a synonym for <i>troth</i>. Both words are related to truth, in that when someone makes a troth or an oath, what is said is taken as the truth. You can see <i>troth</i> in words like <i>betrothal</i>, which means engagement, or <i>betrothed</i>, which refers to a person someone is engaged to.</p></div>`;
