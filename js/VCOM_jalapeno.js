To make salsa, you need tomatoes, <i>jalapenos</i>, and a few other ingredients.</p><p class="long">Most fans of Mexican food are familiar with green jalapenos, the usual stage at which they're picked. If you leave the peppers on the plant, however, the jalapenos eventually turn bright red. In English, the word is spelled either with or without the tilde accent over the <i>n</i>. This accent makes it clear that <i>jalapeño</i> is a Spanish word — and it means "of Jalapa," a place in Mexico known as the birthplace of the jalapeno.</p></div></div>`;
