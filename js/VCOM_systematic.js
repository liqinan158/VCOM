In your <i>systematic</i> search for your mother's car keys, you start in one room, looking everywhere from bottom to top before moving to the next room.</p><p class="long">Use the adjective <i>systematic</i> to describe things that are orderly and efficient. The Latin root of <i>systematic</i> is <i>systema</i>, an arrangement or system. Think about a multi-step process that you have found the fastest and best way to complete â€” you do it over and over. You might be systematic about packing for a long trip or the way you travel up and down the aisles at a grocery store, probably with a list in your hand.</p></div>`;
