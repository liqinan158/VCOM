Flossing your teeth would be considered a good <i>habit</i>. Sucking your thumb would be considered a bad <i>habit</i>, especially as an adult.</p><p class="long">On New Year's people always vow to break their bad habits, but bad habits die hard. The noun <i>habit</i> can also refer to an established custom â€” like the habit of breaking bread with your family every holiday. On a completely different note, clothing that is worn for horseback riding, or by a nun or monk, can also be called a habit. All good nuns should be in the habit of washing their habits.</p></div>`;
