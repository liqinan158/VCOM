In fact, the word comes from old German and Dutch words for "slippery," another word that could be used to describe the very same salesman. In addition to meaning "smooth" and "persuasive," <i>glib</i> can be applied to the kind of thoughtless comment that could get you into big trouble. Telling your boss that you had a "hot time" with his daughter is the kind of glib remark that could end your career.</p></div></div>`;
