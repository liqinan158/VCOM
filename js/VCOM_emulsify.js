While the oil, because it's not soluble, can't be completely combined with the vinegar, you can emulsify the two so that the tiny drops of oil are dispersed across the volume of vinegar and the texture of the salad dressing is satisfying. <i>Emulsify</i> comes from the Latin word <i>emulsus</i>, or "milked out."</p></div></div>`;
