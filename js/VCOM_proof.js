When you show the logical steps that take you from your hypothesis that the world is round to the conclusion that it is, you're formulating a <i>proof</i>.</p><p class="long">Photographic prints that haven't been touched up are also called <i>proofs</i>, and that’s also what you call the first copy of a printed text, before it's checked for errors and corrected. When you check a text for errors, you're proofing. If your poker strategy is foolproof, even somebody who knows nothing about poker — a poker fool, that is — can’t get it wrong. <i>Proof</i> is a word you’ll see on bottles of alcohol, too: 90-proof rum means it's 45% alcohol.</p></div></div>`;
