Similarly, bait and switch is a trick used by businesses to lure customers into their stores. Usually, the bait and switch will start with advertising an extremely low price for something that's usually expensive. That's the bait that gets people into the store. Then, the sale item will be out of stock, but other—more expensive—items will be available. That's the switch. Bait and switch is deceptive and unethical.</p></div></div>`;
