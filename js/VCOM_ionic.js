An <i>ionic</i> bond is the attraction that occurs between ions with opposite charges.</p><p class="long">When you see the adjective <i>ionic</i>, you'll know the topic is science. There are ionic compounds, which are two or more atoms held together with ionic bonding. There's also ionic strength, a measurement of the concentration of ions within a chemical solution. Don't confuse <i>ionic</i>—named for the Greek <i>ion</i>, "go," because ions move toward their opposite charge—with <i>iconic</i>, "relating to an icon or symbol."</p></div>`;
