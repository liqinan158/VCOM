It's most common to describe men as <i>unchivalrous</i>, particularly when they behave impolitely toward women.</p><p class="long">This adjective, like its opposite, <i>chivalrous</i>, is a bit old-fashioned, but it's still used to describe men who don't act gallantly â€” or the ungallant act itself. Both words come from <i>chivalry</i>, the medieval code that knights lived by. If a guy doesn't act the way a gallant knight would, letting the door slam in your face, he's unchivalrous.</p></div>`;
