When the kids you're babysitting swear they brushed their teeth, you can <i>refute</i> their claim by presenting the dry toothbrushes.</p><p class="long">Evidence and arguments are used to refute something. So are facts. For example, if children who eat chocolate before going to bed go straight to sleep, that refutes the idea that sugar keeps them up. <i>Refute</i> comes from the Latin <i>refutare</i> for "to check, suppress." A near synonym is <i>confute</i>, but save <i>refute</i> as an everyday word for proving something is false.</p></div>`;
