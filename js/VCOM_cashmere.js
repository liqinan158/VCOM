The goat itself is also called a <i>cashmere</i>.</p><p class="long">When you knit a sweater from cashmere, you end up with a garment that's much softer and less itchy than regular wool. You can use the same word when you describe the fabric itself, and things made with it: "I want a red <i>cashmere</i> scarf for my birthday." In the 17th century, the word specifically meant "a <i>cashmere</i> shawl," from <i>Kashmir</i>, the region of the Himalayas where this type of goat originated.</p></div></div>`;
