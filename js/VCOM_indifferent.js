You might feel <i>indifferent</i> about politics, changing the channel whenever the TV news comes on.</p><p class="long">People seem indifferent when they're obviously unconcerned â€” an indifferent observer of a tennis match is clearly not rooting for either player, and an indifferent voter might choose a candidate at the last minute by flipping a coin. A slightly less common meaning of <i>indifferent</i> is "unbiased or impartial," which you can see in its root, the Old French <i>indifferent</i>, or "impartial." In this sense of the word, we all hope our laws and legal system are indifferent.</p></div>`;
