Coyotes are distinctive, different from wolves, because of their relatively small size, delicate paws, and large ears. The word <i>coyote</i> is Mexican Spanish, from an Aztec root, <i>c√≥yotl</i>, or "trickster." The scientific name of the coyote is <i>Canis latrans</i>, "barking dog" in Latin. Another informal meaning of <i>coyote</i>, used mainly in the US southwest and Mexico, is a smuggler of illegal immigrants.</p></div>`;
