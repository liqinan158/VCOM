A <i>portrait</i> can be a painting, a photograph, an ink drawing, a sculpture â€” or even a description in words or in a film.</p><p class="long"><i>Portrait</i> is a term often used when talking about artwork. Go to an art museum, especially one that has a historic collection, and you'll likely see many portraits hanging on the walls. Formal portraits were commissioned by wealthy people throughout history. A portrait can also be a written description of someone's appearance or character. If you describe your Mom in such detail that everyone can imagine what she's like, you've created a portrait of her.</p></div></div>`;
