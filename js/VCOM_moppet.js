A sweet <i>moppet</i> sitting behind you on an airplane is completely different from a screaming, kicking kid occupying that seat.</p><p class="long">Though it's a bit old fashioned, you can use the informal word <i>moppet</i> when you're talking fondly about a child. You might watch a group of moppets learning to skate on an ice rink or enjoy a movie about some adorable moppets who scheme to get their lost dog back. Traditionally, this word usually referred to a girl, and earlier it meant "a doll," from the Middle English <i>moppe</i>, "little child or baby doll."</p></div>`;
