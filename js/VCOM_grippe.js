If you fear you're coming down with the <i>grippe</i>, you might spend the day in bed drinking tea.</p><p class="long">When someone feels achy, shivery, and tired, they probably fear having the grippe, which is highly contagious and sickens many people each year, mostly in the winter months. Today it's more commonly called the <i>flu</i>, short for <i>influenza</i>. English speakers called it the grippe in the eighteenth century, from the French <i>grippe</i>, which means "influenza," but also "seizure," from <i>gripper</i>, "grasp or hook."</p></div>`;
