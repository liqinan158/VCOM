Humans have as many as 30 trillion <i>red blood cells</i>.</p><p class="long">Red blood cells are also called <i>erythrocytes</i>. They move constantly in the human body, picking up oxygen in the lungs and delivering it to the heart, which spreads oxygen through the body with every pump of blood. Red blood cells also contain hemoglobin, a protein rich in iron that gives blood its red color. If you don't get enough iron in your diet, your body can't make the hemoglobin your red blood cells need.</p></div>`;
