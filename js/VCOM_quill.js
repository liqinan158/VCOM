John Hancock didn't use a ballpoint to sign the Declaration of Independence, silly. He used a <i>quill</i>!</p><p class="long">The quills of a bird's feathers seem ideally designed for dipping in ink and writing on paper — they're so perfect that this type of old-fashioned pen is also called a <i>quill</i>. In addition to birds, there are some mammals with quills, including porcupines and hedgehogs. We know that <i>quill</i> comes from the Low German <i>quiele </i>, but beyond that its origin is a mystery.</p></div></div>`;
