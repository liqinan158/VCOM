It's scary to watch a big dog <i>attack</i> a smaller dog.</p><p class="long">In the military, an <i>attack</i> is an advance of troops or the use of armed force against an enemy. When one little kid attacks another, there usually aren't any bombs or weapons involved, but the idea of force or hostility is the same. You might also attack an opponent in a game, or withstand a verbal attack from a classmate during a debate. The Italian source of <i>attack</i> is <i>attacco</i>, "an attack," from <i>attaccare</i>, "join battle."</p></div>`;
