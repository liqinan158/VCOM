If you see that someone's been injured in a car accident, it's a good idea to call an <i>ambulance</i>.</p><p class="long">People who are terribly sick, or who are unexpectedly hurt or injured, often need to get to a hospital quickly, and this is what an ambulance is for. As the patient is driven to a hospital, with the ambulance's lights flashing and siren sounding, he or she is often treated by an emergency medical technician. The word comes from the French phrase <i>h√¥pital ambulant</i>, or "walking hospital," from the Latin <i>ambulare</i>, "to walk."</p></div></div>`;
