A dark, stormy sky on the day of a wedding can be seen as inauspicious, and so can an awkward job interview. The opposite of <i>inauspicious</i> is <i>auspicious</i>, which means lucky or promising. Both words come from the Latin <i>auspicium</i>, which has to do with predicting the future by observing the flight of birds.</p></div>`;
