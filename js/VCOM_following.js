The Beatles had a huge <i>following</i>. <i>Following</i> also means “coming after.” Rabid fans were always <i>following</i> the Fab Four around.</p><p class="long">To follow is to go after, like a groupie following a rock star or a panic following an explosion. If you’re watching a TV show, when it’s over you might watch the following show. Also, a following is a bunch of people who follow someone in the sense of believing in them. The movie <i>Blade Runner</i> has a cult following. Sometimes when store clerks want to sound fancy, they say they can help the “following guest” when “next guest” would do.</p></div>`;
