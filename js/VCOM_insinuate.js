If you say things seemed to go wrong about the time your brother took over, you <i>insinuate</i> that he had something to do with the decline.</p><p class="long">There's another way to insinuate. Suppose you're in line to get into a popular dance club when a celebrity appears, surrounded by a big entourage. If you strike up a conversation with one of the entourage, you may be able to insinuate that you're part of the group and go in with them. Don't feel bad â€” people have been doing it at least since the 1520s, when <i>insinuate</i> evolved from the Latin word <i>insinuare</i>, meaning "wind one's way into."</p></div></div>`;
