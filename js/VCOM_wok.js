If you've eaten at a Chinese restaurant, you've had food cooked in a <i>wok</i>.</p><p class="long">A wok is shaped like a big, deep bowl, and while it's most common in South China, it's used all over Asia, and increasingly in the rest of the world as well. The shape of a wok works particularly well for stir frying; the bottom gets much hotter than the sides, and food can be cooked quickly. The word <i>wok</i> comes from Cantonese, and it was first used in English in the mid-20th century.</p></div>`;
