Part of what's beautiful about snow when it first falls is its undisturbed <i>evenness</i>.</p><p class="long">When you're sanding the top of a table or spreading asphalt on a driveway, evenness is what you're aiming for. Another kind of evenness is a balance or equity between things: "The <i>evenness</i> of their salaries seemed fair to the restaurant's employees." Yet another way to have evenness is to be an even number, divisible by two â€” consider, for example, the evenness of the number 14 as opposed to the number 17.</p></div></div>`;
