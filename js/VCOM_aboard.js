Usually the captain will welcome you <i>aboard</i> with a brief speech if you're lucky — or a long one if you're not.</p><p class="long"><i>Aboard</i> comes from the French phrase <i>à bord</i>, which has the same meaning as the English word — on board. If you were just hired, your new manager might say "Welcome <i>aboard</i>" (the figurative company train). The phrase "All <i>aboard</i>!" is said as a warning before departure, especially before a ship or train leaves. It means, in essence: haul your keister up here quick or you'll be left behind!</p></div></div>`;
