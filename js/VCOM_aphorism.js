While there are loads of trite and silly statements, a good aphorism is supposed to stand the test of time and remain true and elegant â€” a very difficult task! Friedrich Schlegel even wrote an aphorism about aphorisms: "An <i>aphorism</i> ought to be entirely isolated from the surrounding world like a little work of art and complete in itself like a hedgehog."</p></div></div>`;
