If you’re making a documentary of events leading up to World War II and you start in the early 1900s and end at the outbreak of the war, in 1939, that’s chronological.  Reverse chronological order means giving the most recent event first, and going backwards from there. <i>Chronological</i> includes the useful Greek root <i>khronos,</i> "time."</p></div>`;
