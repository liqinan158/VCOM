Even reading a grocery list out loud  can be <i>theatrical</i>, if you do it in dramatic voice with an audience watching.</p><p class="long">An actor who works on Broadway rather than in Hollywood is theatrical, and a play can be described as a theatrical production. If it happens in a theater, or is related to theater, it's theatrical. You can also use the adjective <i>theatrical</i> to talk about behavior that seems like it belongs on a stage, like a little boy's melodramatic weeping when he discovers a cheese sandwich in his lunch instead of peanut butter and jelly.</p></div></div>`;
