We won't try to give an answer (even if we had one) here. But if you're interested in exploring this question, you're interested in <i>eschatology</i> â€” the part of theology that has to do with death or the end of the world.</p><p class="long"><i>Eschatology</i> comes from the Greek <i>eskhatos</i>, meaning "last," which makes sense given that this branch of theology is preoccupied with the study of the last part of life or death. More specifically, eschatology involves four elements or "last" things: death, judgment, heaven and hell. It's an examination of the ultimate destiny of mankind.</p></div>`;
