If your final paper for honors English class is scribbled on a torn sheet of notebook paper, that’s <i>substandard</i> work that you’ll probably have to do over.</p><p class="long">A standard is a quality by which something is judged, and <i>sub</i> can mean “under” like a <i>sub</i>marine that goes under water. So things that are substandard fall below most people's standards — they're deficient in some way. A computer that stops working after two weeks is substandard. A car with faulty brakes is substandard. Substandard things are the opposite of well-made things. Turning in substandard work is a good way to get a bad grade.</p></div></div>`;
