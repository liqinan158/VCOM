It might take a lot of willpower not to throw yourself at the cart.</p><p class="long"><i>Abstinence</i> is the opposite of <i>indulgence</i>. People who practice abstinence deny themselves something, often something they really want. Regardless of whether people are abstaining from food, alcohol, or sex, they have to practice self-control. In fact, the word is derived from the Latin term for "to hold back." The word <i>abstinence</i> is often used in reference to sex education courses that teach kids to hold themselves back from having sex.</p></div></div>`;
