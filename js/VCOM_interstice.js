Though <i>interstice</i> is useful for talking about these narrow spaces or openings between things, it's much more commonly used in its plural form. For example, you might complain that in the interstices of your busy day you have to catch up on returning phone calls. The Latin root is <i>interstitium</i>, which literally means "space between."</p></div>`;
