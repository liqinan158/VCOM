You might check out your reflection in a <i>looking glass</i> before you leave the house in the morning.</p><p class="long"><i>Looking glass</i> is a somewhat old-fashioned, literary way to say "mirror." The word <i>glass</i> on its own can mean "mirror" too, coming from a root meaning "to shine." After Lewis Carroll's book "Through the <i>Looking-Glass</i>," was published in 1871, <i>looking glass</i> came to also mean "the opposite of what is normal or expected," like a confusing looking glass world or a mysterious looking glass philosophy.</p></div>`;
