If you deliver newspapers, you are a newspaper carrier. If the job is to transport household items or people, your business is as a common carrier, such as a moving company or an airline. But if you deliver aircraft, you are not an aircraft carrier â€” that would be a large, flat-decked, military ship where planes can land or take off at sea.</p></div>`;
