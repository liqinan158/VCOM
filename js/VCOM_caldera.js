One sign of that power is a caldera, which is a crater formed after a volcano has erupted and collapsed into itself. Some of the more ancient calderas formed mountains and valleys in the Rockies and elsewhere. A related word in English is <i>cauldron</i>, whose modern meaning (a vessel for hot liquids) can remind us of the molten lava of a volcano.</p></div></div>`;
