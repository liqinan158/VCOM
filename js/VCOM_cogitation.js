var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">cogitation</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Cogitation</i> is meditation or deep thinking. Big decisions should be made after <i>cogitation</i>. If people bug you while you’re thinking, impress them by telling them to wait until you’re done with your <i>cogitation</i>. When you’re done, you might shout, “Eureka!”</p><p class="long">This word — like the similar <i>cognitive</i> — has to do with thinking. Cogitation is an example of thinking, especially deep thinking. If someone is trying hard to remember something, they are deep in cogitation. Most people find cogitation easier in a quiet place, like a library. Engaging in cogitation is the opposite of acting rashly without thinking. If you like to ponder or mull things over, you enjoy cogitation. Cogitation means something similar to reflection and consideration.</p></div>`;
