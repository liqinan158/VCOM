The fact that you caught a cold might be <i>related</i> to the fact that the kids you babysat sneezed and coughed all night long.</p><p class="long">People are related when they share a family connection, and other things are related by different kinds of connections. One poem is related to another if they come from the same school or movement of poetry, and a boy's dislike of baseball is probably related to the fact that his first coach yelled a lot. The verb <i>relate</i> is at the root of <i>related</i>, from the Latin <i>relatus</i>, "brought back."</p></div></div>`;
