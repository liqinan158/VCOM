For example, there is absolutely nothing you can do that will make George Clooney invite you to his house on Lake Como. The moon is absolutely not made of green cheese. When I said that I would absolutely not go to that wedding, I wasn't kidding, and I didn't go. <i>Absolutely</i> can also be an interjection, a statement of emotion, as in, "Am I sure I'm up to it? <i>Absolutely</i>!"</p></div>`;
