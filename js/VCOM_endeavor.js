Presumably, NASA had loftier objects in mind when they named one of their space shuttles <i>Endeavour</i>, using the British spelling. The word comes from the Old French phrase <i>mettre en deveir</i>, or "put in duty." As a verb, it's a more impressive word than <i>try</i> and suggests you're doing your darnedest to make something happen.</p></div>`;
