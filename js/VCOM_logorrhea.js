Sounds better than "loudmouth."</p><p class="long">As its sound suggests, <i>logorrhea</i> is related to diarrhea â€” an inability to stop something far more unpleasant from flowing. Diarrhea comes from two Greek words put together, <i>dia</i> meaning "through" and <i>rhein</i> meaning "to flow." In the case of <i>logorrhea,</i> the <i>log</i> prefix is from the Greek word for "words," meaning literally "words flowing through." Technically speaking, logorrhea is an actual illness, unlike such similar terms for extreme chattiness such as <i>loquacious</i> or <i>garrulous</i>.</p></div>`;
