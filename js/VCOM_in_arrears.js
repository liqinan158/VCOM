If you don't make your car payment for a few months, you're <i>in arrears</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>In arrears</i> is a legal term for being behind on a debt â€” either you haven't paid it back when you promised to, or you've missed a monthly payment or two. A landlord can legally evict a tenant who's in arrears with their rent payment, and a bank can charge fees and hurt your credit if your loan payment is in arrears. <i>In arrears</i> comes from the Middle English <i>arrear</i>, "behind or overdue," from a Latin root.</p></div></div>`;
