When a couple ties the knot, they are engaging in <i>matrimony</i>.</p><p class="long">You can describe the actual wedding celebration as matrimony, and also the state of being married, although it's a formal word most often used in documents and in the words of the ceremony. The Latin word for matrimony is <i>matrimonium</i>, which comes from combining <i>mater</i>, "mother," with the suffix <i>monium</i>, "action or condition." In the old days, matrimony was basically the same thing as making a woman into a wife and mother.</p></div>`;
