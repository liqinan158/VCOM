This word applies to everyone who is a blood relation: a mother and father are not consanguineous, but they are both consanguineous with their biological children. All the puppies or kittens in a litter are consanguineous. First cousins are consanguineous. An adopted child will not be consanguineous with anyone in his or her adoptive family.</p></div>`;
