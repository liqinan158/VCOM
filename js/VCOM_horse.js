Part of learning how to ride a <i>horse</i> includes giving commands and using the reins to guide it.</p><p class="long">Horses are very strong and fast, which is why humans have domesticated them for thousands of years â€” horses can be helpful on farms, for riding, and for pulling wagons and carts.
