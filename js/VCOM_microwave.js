Instead of the electric or gas heat that a regular oven uses, a <i>microwave</i> heats with electromagnetic radiation.</p><p class="long">While the heat of a regular oven (or a small toaster oven) surrounds your food and cooks it from the outside, with the heat working its way in, a microwave's radiation cooks most food from the inside out. Its radiation, or waves, penetrate the food and heat up any moisture inside it. These waves are themselves called <i>microwaves</i> because they're short (and <i>micro-</i> means "small"), similar to radio waves.</p></div></div>`;
