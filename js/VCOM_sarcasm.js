Saying "Oh, you're soooo clever!" with sarcasm means the target is really just a dunderhead.</p><p class="long"><i>Sarcasm</i> is sometimes used as merely a synonym of <i>irony</i>, but the word has a more specific sense: irony that's meant to mock or convey contempt. This meaning is found in its etymology. In Greek, <i>sarkazein</i> meant "to tear flesh; to wound." When you use sarcasm, you really tear into them. A clever person coined the variant spelling <i>sarchasm</i> (a blend of <i>sarcasm</i> and <i>chasm</i>) and defined it as "the gap between the author of sarcastic wit and the person who doesn't get it."</p></div></div>`;
