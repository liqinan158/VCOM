Christians observe rituals at Christmas including church attendance and reenactments of Bible stories surrounding the birth of Christ. Non-religious observers exchange presents, tell stories about Santa Claus, and usually decorate a lighted Christmas tree. In Old English, it was <i>Cristes m√¶sse</i>, or "Christ mass."
