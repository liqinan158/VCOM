It is quite an enduring word! The original root meant hard, so your enduring friendship or your enduring interest in sports is solid enough to stand the test of time. Besides meaning long-lasting, <i>enduring</i> sometimes means long-suffering as when someone has an enduring disposition, but this meaning is found in the verb more than in the adjective.</p></div>`;
