If you've been wrongly accused of robbery, you'd better hope a judge will <i>exculpate</i> you, unless you want to go to jail because you've heard prison food is amazing.</p><p class="long"><i>Exculpate</i> comes from two Latin words: <i>ex-</i>, meaning "from," and <i>culpa</i>, meaning "blame." <i>Exculpate</i> is similar in meaning to <i>exonerate</i>. When you exonerate someone, you clear a person of an accusation and any suspicion that goes along with it. <i>Exculpate</i> usually refers more directly to clearing the charges against someone. So if that judge exculpates you from the robbery charge, everyone in town might still think you did it. Get him to exculpate and exonerate you.</p></div></div>`;
