You might complain about your <i>ineffective</i> guard dog, who wags his tail and licks everyone who comes to your house.</p><p class="long">When you're ineffective, you're unable to accomplish something you're trying to do. You might realize that you're an ineffective babysitter when you can't get the kids to go to bed. <i>Ineffective</i> comes from the Latin prefix <i>in</i>, "not, or opposite of," added to <i>effective</i>, whose Latin root is <i>effectivus</i>, "productive." When something's unproductive, inefficient, or incapable, it's ineffective.</p></div></div>`;
