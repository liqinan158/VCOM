The <i>dis-</i>  of <i>disseminate</i> and <i>distribute</i> come from the same Latin prefix which means "apart, in a different direction." But unlike papers distributed in class, information, once spread around in all directions, cannot be pulled back in. Think about false rumors or political smear campaigns and you'll understand that dissemination is usually a one-way process.</p></div></div>`;
