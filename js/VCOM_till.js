When you work at the store long enough, they'll let you operate the <i>till</i>.</p><p class="long">When you pay taxes to your town, they go into the local till, or government fund, for community improvements. <i>Till</i> is also used as a verb, meaning to work the land, to get it ready for planting and harvesting. <i>Till</i> can also be used to mean "until," which makes things a bit confusing. So, technically, you could have a sentence like: Don't touch the till till you take the customer's money.</p></div>`;
