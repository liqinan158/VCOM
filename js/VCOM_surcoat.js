Pictures of medieval knights often show them with loose <i>surcoats</i> over their armor.</p><p class="long">Men wore surcoats from around the 12th century, while women began to wear them about a hundred years later. A knight's surcoat was often decorated with a coat of arms and had long slits at the front and back to allow the knight to move freely and ride a horse easily. During the 14th century, a stylish surcoat for women was floor-length, with extremely large arm holes, so the dress beneath could be seen.</p></div></div>`;
