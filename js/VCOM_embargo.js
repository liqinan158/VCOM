If you canâ€™t get those yummy Swedish fish, perhaps there has been an <i>embargo</i> on trade with Sweden!</p><p class="long">The fact that ships cannot move during an embargo makes sense from the Latin root of the word, a verb meaning impede with barriers. If one government places a trade embargo on another, it can be an act of war between the two countries. But if an arms embargo is in place, many countries refuse to sell arms to a particular country because it is especially violent. As a verb, the use of <i>embargo</i> is a little broader. If you write an impassioned plea for peace, but the government embargoes it, no one will read your writing.</p></div>`;
