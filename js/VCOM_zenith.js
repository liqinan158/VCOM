The sun reaches its <i>zenith</i> when it is as high in the sky as it is going to go on that day.</p><p class="long"><i>Zenith</i> — and its opposite, <i>nadir</i> — have been appropriated by non-astronomers and are used to describe high and low points in non-astronomical contexts. For example, you can say that the high school quarterback hit his zenith in high school, and it was all downhill from there. Do yourself a favor and try to delay your zenith so you'll have something to look forward to in your future!</p></div></div>`;
