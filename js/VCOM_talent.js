You can have a <i>talent</i> for singing or a <i>talent</i> for getting others to talk about themselves. People who work in creative professions are often called "the <i>talent</i>."</p><p class="long">In Biblical times, a talent was a unit of money, and a New Testament parable tells of a master punishing a servant for hiding, rather than investing, a bag of talents in the master's absence. The interpretation of this parable to mean that you should not hide your "God-given <i>talents</i>" has led to the current meaning of the word as the special qualities a person possesses.</p></div>`;
