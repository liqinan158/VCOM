That was a <i>dungeon,</i> otherwise known as the "keep," and most familiar to us today from a million video games and movies.</p><p class="long">In fact, the original meaning of <i>dungeon</i> was of something overground rather than underground, coming from the Old French term <i>donjon</i>, meaning the "great tower of a castle," and the underground meaning only came later. Rapunzel in the fairy tale was held captive in a tower rather than an underground cell and if she hadn't been, her long hair wouldn't have been much help in her escape.</p></div>`;
