Although <i>sovereignty</i> is usually used in a political sense â€” particularly the power of nations, it can be used to describe personal control as well: If your mother insists upon your wearing wool hats in summertime, you might declare complete sovereignty over your wardrobe. The word is also occasionally used for the power of royalty, like a queen.</p></div></div>`;
