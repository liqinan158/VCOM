The Middle English word <i>bocchen</i> meant to mend or repair. As a noun <i>botch</i> means an embarrassing mistake or something that is done poorly, especially due to lack of skill. If they've never painted before, your friends working on set design might make a complete botch of the scenery for the play, which might involve repainting the whole thing.</p></div></div>`;
