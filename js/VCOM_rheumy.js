Your dog may look spry and healthy, but his gray snout and <i>rheumy</i> eyes give away his age.</p><p class="long">This adjective almost always describes the damp eyes of a person or animal. If a character in a book is described as "wizened and stooped, with rheumy eyes," you can be sure they're an elderly person. Someone whose eyes water due to illness can be described this way too: "It was tragic to see all of those coughing children with rheumy eyes." <i>Rheumy</i> comes from <i>rheum</i>, "mucus," and its Greek root <i>rheuma</i>, "that which flows."</p></div>`;
