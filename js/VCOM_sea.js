Much grander than a lake or river, a <i>sea</i> can appear open and endless when you view it from the shore.</p><p class="long">The best-known examples of <i>sea</i> include the Mediterranean Sea, Bering Sea, and Caribbean Sea. The word <i>sea</i> can also refer to large waves. If there's a sea  warning, it would be wise to reschedule your sailing trip. Sea can be used more figuratively to describe something that seems to be vast in quantity, just like the sea. The audience at your concert might look like an endless sea of people.</p></div></div>`;
