They meet at a right angle. A person who is standing is <i>perpendicular</i> to the earth.</p><p class="long">Use <i>perpendicular</i> to describe lines, angles, and direction. In geometry a perpendicular angle is 90 degrees, a perfect L. On a compass, East and North are perpendicular to each other. The term can be used more generally to describe any steep angle. You might talk about a ski slope that is nearly perpendicular but that's impossible since gravity would make you fall off a 90-degree angle. But if it's close enough, no one's really measuring.</p></div>`;
