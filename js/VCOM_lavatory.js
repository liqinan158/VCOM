Most people would never refer to this room in their own homes as a <i>lavatory</i>, although they might use this word for public restrooms in schools, hospitals, or other buildings. In the U.K., a <i>lavatory</i> is just a toilet, and its earliest meaning was "washbasin," from the Latin root <i>lavatorium</i>, or "place for washing."</p></div>`;
