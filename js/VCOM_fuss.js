A <i>fuss</i> is a state of excitement, and it's usually about something not worth worrying or "fussing" about.</p><p class="long">Most fusses are types of commotion. If someone makes a fuss, they're overexcited and in a tizzy over something, like someone who can't stop asking questions. Another fuss is angrier: you might say "What's the <i>fuss</i>?" if you hear two people yelling at each other. A fuss is also any kind of hubbub or whirlwind of activity, like a huge crowd swarming toward a sale. Parents tend to fuss over their children. Someone who fusses is worrying too much.</p></div>`;
