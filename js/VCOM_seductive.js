The word comes from the Latin <i>seducere</i>, meaning “draw aside.”  When someone draws your attention aside from whatever you’re doing, that is a seductive person.  Radio people often have seductive voices that lull you to sleep, and stores put their most seductive items in the front window in hopes that you’ll be tempted to come inside and buy them.</p></div>`;
