It's an informal, childish nickname, a shortened form of <i>grandpappa</i>, most popular in the 1700s, which spawned <i>grandpappy</i> and <i>grandpop</i> as well. When you are referring to your mom or dad's mother, you can replace the "p" with an "m" and use the word (yes, you guessed it!) <i>grandma</i>.</p></div></div>`;
