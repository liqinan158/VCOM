If you find one <i>flea</i> in your dog's fur, there may be hundreds more hiding in there.</p><p class="long">Fleas live by sucking blood from a host â€” they're parasites. You can just barely see a flea with the naked eye, and when you do spot one it may be hopping, since they're known to jump, sometimes from one animal to another. Flea bites are itchy, and fleas can be tricky to get rid of once they've laid eggs on your dog (or in your bed). Some experts think the word's root s the Old English <i>fleon</i>, "to flee."</p></div>`;
