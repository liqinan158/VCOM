Religious believers <i>worship</i> gods, and people can <i>worship</i> other people and things too.</p><p class="long"><i>Worship</i> is an extreme form of love — it's a type of unquestioning devotion. If you worship God, then you love God so much that you don't question him at all. Going to church is a form of <i>worship</i> — so is prayer. People also use the word <i>worship</i> in other cases. If you love a musician or sports star, you might say, "I worship her!" Or someone might say to you, "Man, you need to wake up and stop worshiping him."</p></div></div>`;
