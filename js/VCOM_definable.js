var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">definable</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The adjective <i>definable</i> describes something that is capable of being explained or described. Your children will do better with a few <i>definable</i> rules. "Don't hit anyone" is much clearer to a three-year-old than the vague "don't do anything you wouldn't want someone to do to you."</p><p class="long"><i>Definable</i> is based on the word <i>define</i>, which is from the Latin word <i>definire</i>, meaning to limit or explain. You can take a definable risk if you understand the boundaries and consequences of the risks involved. Knowing the limits can help you make an informed decision about whether the risk is worth it. Exceeding the speed limit is definable, because driving rules are spelled out in manuals and you will get a ticket if you are caught.</p></div>`;
