It carries with it a feeling of being truly impressed. <i>Astonish</i> derives from the Latin <i>tonare</i> 'thunder.' When you are astonished, you're thunderstruck. If you plan to astonish someone, you might say before hand, "Wait until you see this. It's going to knock your socks off."</p></div></div>`;
