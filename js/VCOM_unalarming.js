var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">unalarming</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If something's <i>unalarming</i>, it's nothing to get upset about. If your dog's barking late at night doesn't worry you at all, you find it <i>unalarming</i>.</p><p class="long">The root of this word is the verb <i>alarm</i>, which means "cause to feel frightened or disturbed." And when something is <i>alarming</i>, it's scary, upsetting, or disturbing. So the adjective <i>unalarming</i>, with that added prefix <i>un-</i>, means the opposite: "Everything's fine! That noise is completely unalarming. It's just my broken smoke detector going off again."</p></div></div>`;
