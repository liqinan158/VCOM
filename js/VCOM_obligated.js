For example, you’re obligated to pay your taxes by April 15. It can also mean that you just feel like you need to do something because it’s the right thing to do or because you feel like you owe someone. You’re obligated to go to your best friend’s birthday party, even though you’d rather be out with your new boyfriend.</p></div></div>`;
