You can <i>rummage</i> through your drawer looking for a lost sock, or you could even hold "a <i>rummage</i> sale" to sell off all your socks that are missing their mates.</p><p class="long">Ahoy, mateys: the word <i>rummage</i> hails from a sea-faring background. The Middle Dutch <i>ruim</i>, Germanic <i>rum</i>, and Old English <i>rum</i> all referred to a compartment on a ship, probably stemming from the Middle French verb <i>arrumer</i>, "to stow goods in the hold of a ship." The idea of <i>rummaging</i> as searching was first recorded in the 1620s. The first <i>rummage</i> sale also had its ship connection, as it was a sale on the docks of unclaimed items.</p></div>`;
