It's definitely slang but not really obscene.</p><p class="long">This is a word that's on the borderline between acceptable slang and potty language. You can be 100% sure that saying the s-word (which means almost exactly the same thing as <i>crap</i>) will get you in trouble if you said it in class, but <i>crap</i> isn't so clear cut. It's sort of naughty but getting less naughty all the time. But whether you're taking a crap (pooping) or being told to get all the crap (junk) off your desk, you'll find that crap of any kind is never held in high regard.</p></div>`;
