It is traitorous when a double agent sells her country's secrets to another government: and the traitorous person risks spending her life in prison or even being executed. It's also traitorous to tell your parents that your brother broke the kitchen window, if you've sworn to him that you'll keep his secret.</p></div></div>`;
