Cinderella was the <i>belle</i> of the ball, at least until midnight.</p><p class="long"><i>Belle</i> comes from the Latin <i>bella</i> for “beautiful.” If you ever hear a woman being called a belle, it has nothing to do with ringing; she's super foxy. A Southern Belle is a lovely girl from the South, like Scarlett O’Hara from <i>Gone with the Wind</i>. A belle can be from anywhere, though, as long as she stands out. A belle has rivals, but she is more attractive and desirable. The belle is a little like the prom queen.</p></div>`;
