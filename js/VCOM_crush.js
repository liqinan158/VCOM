var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">crush</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you <i>crush</i> something, you break it into tiny pieces or crumple it. If you <i>crush</i> the cans in your recycling bin, you'll make more room for more.</p><p class="long">A train can crush a car that's stalled on the tracks, and a person can crush an insect between her fingers. A figurative meaning of <i>crush</i> is to subdue or stop, like when a military dictator's forces crush a rebel uprising. You can also use <i>crush</i> as a noun to mean "an overwhelming number," like a crush of bodies on a packed subway car, or to describe infatuation, like your crush on your attractive neighbor, who also can be called your crush.</p></div>`;
