If a biology teacher says <i>nucleus</i>, she is probably talking about a cell (or a group of cells), but a physics teacher would be talking about the center of an atom, or possibly even the center of a comet’s head. Step out of science class, and <i>nucleus</i> likely refers to a core group — like the math fanatics that math club could not function without.</p></div></div>`;
