A <i>sideshow</i> is also something that distracts from a main event.</p><p class="long">The first sideshows happened at the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, from the idea that some performers would be better viewed up close, instead of in a large tent. The popularity of sideshows grew through the first half of the 20th century. Attractions ranged from so-called "freaks" like the contortionists to tricks like sword swallowing and fire breathing. Today <i>sideshow</i> is often used for something that takes attention away from what's really important.</p></div>`;
