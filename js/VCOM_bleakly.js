After moving to a new town, you might set <i>bleakly</i> off for school each day, lonely and missing your friends.</p><p class="long">If your dad stares bleakly out at the snow-covered driveway on a winter morning, he's probably feeling hopeless about clearing it in time to leave for work. After a long drought, a farm's dry, cracked fields might seem to stretch bleakly across the horizon. The original meaning of <i>bleak</i> was "pale," from the Old Norse root <i>bleikr</i>, "whitish or blond." Later, <i>bleak</i> came to mean "bare and windswept," with the figurative meaning of "cheerless."</p></div>`;
