In the wild, they typically eat grains and seeds, but in New York City, you might see them eating discarded popcorn, French fries — just about anything dropped by careless pedestrians.</p><p class="long">Pigeons have round bodies, short necks, and small beaks. These common birds are related to doves. Their feathers are mostly gray, but if you look closely at a pigeon you'll notice shades of green, blue, and white. The distinction between pigeons and doves is vague — often, the word <i>dove</i> simply means an all-white pigeon, though sometimes it refers to a smaller variety of bird. <i>Pigeon</i> is French, from a Latin root, <i>pipio</i>, "young, chirping bird."</p></div></div>`;
