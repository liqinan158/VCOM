If you grab a ride home from school with your best friend, you are a <i>passenger</i> in her car.</p><p class="long">Everyone riding in a train, plane, bus, or any other vehicle is a passenger â€” except the driver, pilot, or crew. A passenger's only job is to ride along. In the fourteenth century, a passenger was simply a "passer-by," from the Old French <i>passagier</i>, "passing, fleeting, or traveling." The first instance of the modern use was recorded in the early 1500s.</p></div></div>`;
