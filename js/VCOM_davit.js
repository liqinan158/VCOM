Oil rigs and cruise ships are examples of vessels that have permanent, fixed <i>davits</i>.</p><p class="long">One of the less well-known facts about the Titanic disaster is that its crew wasn't properly trained on how to operate the davits. The lifeboats were boarded and lowered so slowly that the crew wasn't able to use every available lifeboat in time. Modern ships installed with davits make it easy to get passengers into these boats and get them into the water. <i>Davit</i> comes from <i>David</i> and a tradition of referring to objects with a person's name.</p></div>`;
