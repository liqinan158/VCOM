You might <i>collude</i> with your twin sister to find out where all the birthday presents are hidden.</p><p class="long">The word <i>collude</i> entered English in the 16th century from the Latin word <i>colludere</i>, meaning “have a secret agreement,” a combination of <i>col-</i>, meaning “together,” and <i>ludere</i>, meaning “to play.” When you collude with someone, it's like you’re playing together on the same team for the purpose of getting something you want, typically something illegal or harmful. Companies may collude to keep prices high, or politicians may collude to keep damaging information secret.</p></div></div>`;
