Dental <i>floss</i> is a strong, thick thread that can reach small pieces of food in tight spaces.</p><p class="long">Your dentist will be happy with you if you really do use floss every day â€” and to do this is to <i>floss</i>. Other types of floss are soft threads with different uses: some floss is made for stitching or embroidering designs on fabric, and the strands of silk spun by a silkworm are also floss. The origin of this word is uncertain, but one guess connects it to <i>floche</i>, "tuft of wool" in French.</p></div></div>`;
