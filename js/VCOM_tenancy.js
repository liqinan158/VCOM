You could say, for example, that your <i>tenancy</i> in the little white farmhouse lasted for six years, until you moved to the city.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>tenancy</i> means a period of living in a certain place or having a business in a specific building. If you give up your tenancy, you move to a new place, and if your tenancy ends earlier than you expected, you may owe your landlord some money. The word <i>tenancy</i> is closely related to <i>tenant</i>, with its earliest meaning of "one who holds land," from a Latin root â€” <i>tenere</i>, "to keep" or "to hold."</p></div></div>`;
