The word can also mean honest, uninterrupted, undiluted, or heterosexual.</p><p class="long">In Middle English, <i>strecchen</i> meant "to stretch." <i>Streght</i> "stretched" emerged from it and morphed into <i>straight</i>. It's easy to see the connection: If you stretch out a piece of spaghetti or a curl, it looks linear. Today the word means free from bends, breaks, or irregularities literally or figuratively. "Give it to me <i>straight</i>" means "just the facts, ma'am." "I was up for seven <i>straight</i> days" means "I haven't slept in a week."</p></div>`;
