A chocolate Easter bunny looks like so much chocolate until you realize that it is <i>hollow</i> and quickly eaten.</p><p class="long">The idea of emptiness is apparent in the other uses for hollow too. A valley between mountains is called a hollow and if you're really thin, you may have hollow cheeks. Things like words and promises are hollow if the person uttering them does not intend to keep them. And a hollow victory is not very satisfying, as it means that you have reached your goal, but lost something more important along the way.</p></div></div>`;
