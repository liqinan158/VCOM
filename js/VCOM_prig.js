Prigs tend to be self-centered and uptight and aren't much fun to be around. In the eighteenth century, <i>prig</i> meant "precise in speech in manners," and implied someone who was deeply religious. The origin of the word is a mystery — its earlier meanings included "dandy or fop" and "thief."</p></div></div>`;
