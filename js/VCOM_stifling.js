If your mother insists on accompanying you on your first date, that will probably feel <i>stifling</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Stifle</i> comes from the Middle English word <i>stuffle</i>, which means to kill by cutting off air. A really hot movie theater is stifling, as is an environment where you never get any space to yourself. This word can also be used as a noun to refer to the act of repressing or shutting something down, such as a dictator's stifling of popular protests. Either way, if something is stifling, it's preventing something else from living freely and fully.</p></div>`;
