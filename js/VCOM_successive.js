If three presidents in a row were over sixty, you could say, "Three successive presidents were over sixty."</p><p class="long"><i>Successive</i> is a word that comes up often when you're looking at the history of something. Back in the 1960s, eight successive Boston Celtics teams won the NBA championship. In school, if you do very well, you could get an A in three successive math classes. Even though <i>successive</i> has the word <i>success</i> in it, it's not necessarily a good thing: you could also miss ten successive free throws.</p></div></div>`;
