The image was a hologram: it’s not real, but it’s an accurate 3D image created by light beams. You can use the word <i>holographic</i> for anything pertaining to holograms, including the holographic device that creates the holographic image. The content of the hologram could be called a holographic message. The science of making holograms is called holography.</p></div></div>`;
