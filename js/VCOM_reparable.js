You may be disappointed if someone knocks over your house of cards, but you can take comfort knowing that the structure is <i>reparable</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Reparable</i> is a close relative of its more common synonym <i>repairable</i> (both basically mean “able to be repaired"). The word <i>reparable</i>, though, is usually reserved for damages or injuries that can be reversed or losses that can be replaced, while the word <i>repairable</i> is more for things or problems that can be fixed. For example, if your friend broke your glasses, they are repairable, but if he hurt your pride, it is reparable — hopefully.</p></div></div>`;
