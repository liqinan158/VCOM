If you watch long, thin blades of grass swishing in the breeze, they look like <i>lissome</i> dancers with swaying arms and torsos.</p><p class="long">Some examples of <i>lissome</i> bodies are those of mermaids twisting through the water, small snakes squiggling into sand piles, and men and women who bound up stairs as if they're light as air. A straw is thin and bendy, and you can use it to lift some liquid from a glass. <i>Lissome</i> sounds a little like "lift some," and it's an adjective for thin and flexible people, like a lissome ballerina with a gracefully arched back. Light, lean, liquid in movement â€” lissome.</p></div></div>`;
