When Hamlet says "to be or not to be," he is questioning whether he should live or die, the inverse of living. Just be careful of what's called a "double negative," where you use <i>not</i> with another negating word and end up negating your negation. If you say you don't know nothing about something, that means you do know something. <i>Not</i> is often contracted as in <i>don't</i>, or <i>isn't</i>.</p></div></div>`;
