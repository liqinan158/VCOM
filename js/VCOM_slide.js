If you’re into that kind of thing, head to a playground and go down a <i>slide</i>. Just don’t push any toddlers out of the way.</p><p class="long">You can slide your bed across your room so it's near the window, or slide on the kitchen floor in your socks. You can also slide down a slide, a play structure that's designed for climbing up and sliding down. Another kind of slide is the small rectangular piece of glass that scientists slide under a microscope to examine specimens, or the photography slide you slide into a projector for viewing.</p></div></div>`;
