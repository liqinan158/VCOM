Abstract Expressionists may have been able to <i>daub</i> a canvas with paint and sell it for millions, but you probably wouldn’t be so lucky.</p><p class="long"><i>Daub</i> can be used as a verb or as a noun, and is derived from the Old French <i>debaur</i> which comes from the Latin <i>dealbare</i> “to whiten.” It is also used to describe the process of covering a surface with an adhesive substance such as plaster, mud or grease. However, in its noun form, it means  a smear of something. When you are ordering "a bagel with a smear," you could impress the guy at the deli by asking for "a <i>daub</i>" instead.</p></div></div>`;
