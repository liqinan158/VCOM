Twin sisters might argue nightly over who gets the top <i>bunk</i>.</p><p class="long">You might find a bunk bed in a child's bedroom or a train's sleeper car. Sometimes the rough bed in a rustic cabin is also called a <i>bunk</i> â€” and you could say, "I'll <i>bunk</i> in the cabin tonight." Informally, <i>bunk</i> is also nonsense: "How can you believe that <i>bunk</i>?" The bed meaning is short for <i>bunker</i>, while the "foolishness" definition is from <i>bunkum</i>, named for a politician's long, dull speech in 1820, in Buncombe, North Carolina.</p></div>`;
