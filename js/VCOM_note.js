You might write a <i>note</i> to your sister on the back of your grocery list, or jot down a quick <i>note</i> reminding yourself to call your grandmother later.</p><p class="long">You might slip a love note under a door, or leave your cat sitter a note explaining how much to feed Fluffy. Other notes are taken during lectures or written in notebooks by journalists during interviews. You can also make a mental note, paying particular attention to something in the hopes that you'll remember it later. The Old French <i>noter</i>, "indicate or write down," comes from the Latin root <i>notare</i>, "to mark or note," from <i>nota</i>, "mark."</p></div></div>`;
