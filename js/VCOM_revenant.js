If your cat goes missing for weeks, only to stroll back into your house one morning, you could describe him as a <i>revenant</i>.</p><p class="long">Anyone who comes back after being gone for a long time can be described as revenant, which can be a noun or an adjective. You can even use <i>revenant</i> to talk about ghosts, in that they are said to be spirits of those returning from the dead, or a fashion trend from long ago that is popular again, like revenant tie-dye t-shirts.  The word <i>revenant</i> comes from the French <i>revenir</i>, which means "to return."</p></div>`;
