You might lament that your pair of dogs was divided in <i>twain</i> when you had to give one of them away.</p><p class="long">The word <i>twain</i> is hardly ever used these days, so you're most likely to see it in an old book of poetry, or in the phrase "never the <i>twain</i> shall meet." This saying means that two people — or groups of people — are so unlike each other that they'll never manage to see things the same way. The origin of <i>twain</i> is the Old English word for <i>two</i>, <i>twegen</i>.</p></div></div>`;
