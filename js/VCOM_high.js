If you want to see a really <i>high</i> mountain, you should visit Mount Everest.</p><p class="long">You can also use <i>high</i> to describe a sound or musical note that is elevated in pitch. Some stores use a high-pitched buzzing sound to keep teenagers from loitering. The noise drives teens crazy, but it doesn't bother their parents, because adults can't hear the high frequency. <i>High</i> also means a state of euphoria. After you win a first place medal at the swim meet, you might be on a high for days.</p></div></div>`;
