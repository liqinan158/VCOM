If your bird cage is at full <i>capacity</i>, you can't stuff one more feathered friend in there without causing birdie claustrophobia.</p><p class="long">From the Latin word <i>capacitatem</i> meaning “breadth, capacity,” <i>capacity</i> is a noun that in the simplest sense means "ability" or "capability": the capability of a room to hold a certain number of people, the ability of a law to change crime rates, your ability to pick up foreign languages. You might hear about factories working at "full capacity" — that means at full speed, producing as much as they possibly can.</p></div></div>`;
