If your kayak has a leak, it might fill with water and <i>sink</i> to the bottom of the lake.</p><p class="long">Things can sink, like a toy octopus descending to the bottom of the bathtub or the sun appearing to sink below the horizon. You can also deliberately sink something, as when you capsize your friend's remote controlled speedboat on purpose. When <i>sink</i> is a noun, it's the water basin in your kitchen or bathroom. The Old English root of both kinds of <i>sink</i> is <i>sincan</i>, "become submerged or go under," from a Germanic source.</p></div>`;
