In addition to audio recordings, there are also video recordings, like the one you take of your little brother's dance recital or soccer game. <i>Recording</i> comes from the verb <i>record</i>, which we can trace back to the Latin <i>recordari</i>, "remember, call to mind, or be mindful of."</p></div></div>`;
