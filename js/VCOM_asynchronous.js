If you pick up the crossword puzzle I started yesterday, we are working on it together but in an <i>asynchronous</i> fashion.  Please do it in pencil.</p><p class="long"><i>Asynchronous</i> is the opposite of <i>synchronous</i>, which means happening at the same time.  Think of “synchronous” as “in synch” and <i>asynchronous</i> as “out of synch.”  If we're chatting on the phone, our communication is “synchronous.”  We respond to each other immediately and when we hang up, the conversation's over.  Email is <i>asynchronous</i> because we respond whenever it's convenient.  In some cases this means never, which can be mighty convenient.</p></div></div>`;
