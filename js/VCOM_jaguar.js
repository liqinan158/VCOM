The <i>jaguar</i> is so fast that a famously fancy car is named after it.</p><p class="long">The jaguar, third-largest of all the cats, looks like a bigger, stronger version of a leopard. They were once common in the western part of the United States, but have nearly been eradicated there and verge on being endangered worldwide. The word <i>jaguar</i> is Portuguese in origin, from the Tupi <i>jaguara</i>, which is a general term for any large, predatory animal.</p></div>`;
