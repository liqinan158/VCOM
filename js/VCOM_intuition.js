The definition of the word comes from the Latin roots <i>in</i>- meaning "at" or "on" and <i>tueri</i> meaning "look at, watch over." A relative of <i>intuition</i> is <i>tuition</i>, and even though we don't use this particular meaning anymore, it used to refer to having guardianship or custody. If we use our <i>intuition</i> it means that we don't always make the correct interpretation, and in fact, the Australian writer Christina Stead wrote, "Intuition is not infallible; it only seems to be the truth."</p></div>`;
