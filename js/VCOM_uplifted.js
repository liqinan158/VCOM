After seeing a heartwarming movie, you may walk out of the theater feeling <i>uplifted</i>.</p><p class="long">You might be uplifted after getting the news that you were cast in the school play or that your best friend made the Olympic fencing team. Your favorite music might also leave you uplifted. This emotional meaning is the most common definition of <i>uplifted</i>, although there's also a more literal use of the word, to mean "lifted up," the way your face is uplifted to the sun as you lounge on your beach chair.</p></div></div>`;
