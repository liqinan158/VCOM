A stern teacher who is criticizing an empty-headed English essay might talk about its <i>vacuity</i>, or the absence of any real substance.</p><p class="long">This abstract noun is derived from the adjective <i>vacuous</i>, which means "like or of a vacuum." <i>Vacuity</i> is rarely used to refer to actual vacuums; it is instead used to disparage arguments, morals, and undertakings that lack proper substance. These transferred meanings are more common for the adjective as well. Use them both sparingly: they are nearly always a marker that you have your judgment hat on!</p></div></div>`;
