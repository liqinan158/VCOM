Newspapers issue corrections for previously printed errors, and a poorly written law might get the correction it needs after voters choose to amend it. Sometimes <i>correction</i> is also used to mean "punishment or discipline," and a correction or correctional facility is another word for jail. <i>Correction</i> can also mean "a drop in the value of a stock that was artificially high."</p></div>`;
