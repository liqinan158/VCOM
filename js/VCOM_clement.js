It's much more common to hear the antonym of <i>clement</i>, <i>inclement</i>, describing terrible weather. <i>Clement</i> first appeared in the 13th century as a surname, or last name, from the Latin <i>clementem</i>, "mild or placid," and was used to describe nice weather by the 17th century.</p></div>`;
