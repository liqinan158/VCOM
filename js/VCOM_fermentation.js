Microorganisms like yeast and bacteria usually play a role in the <i>fermentation</i> process, creating beer, wine, bread, kimchi, yogurt and other foods.</p><p class="long"><i>Fermentation</i> comes from the Latin word <i>fermentare</i>, meaning “to leaven.” To make bread rise, you use a leavening agent to “wake up” dry yeast by mixing it with water. The yeast then starts “eating” the sugar in the dough and off-gassing alcohol: that’s fermentation. Grape juice becomes wine as the fermentation process is complete.</p></div>`;
