Your coffee shop boss might <i>demote</i> you to wiping tables if your attempts to froth milk and pull espresso shots continuously fail.</p><p class="long">When your employer demotes you, she assigns you an easier task or even an entirely new, lower-ranked position. You may even earn less money. In the military, to demote is to move a soldier down in rank, usually as a punishment. The opposite of <i>demote</i> is <i>promote</i>, which came first. The prefix <i>de-</i> gives the word a sense of "down" or "down from."</p></div>`;
