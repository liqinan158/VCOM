Some peels are thick and easy to remove, like an orange <i>peel</i>, while others might be more stubborn, like the thin <i>peel</i> on a potato.</p><p class="long">When you remove an apple peel or the peel of an eggplant, you <i>peel</i> it. You can peel anything with a rind or skin, especially things you can eat, like shrimp and onions. There are non-edible things to peel, like stickers and old wallpaper too. You can also figuratively peel something: "I had to <i>peel</i> off my wet clothes and put dry ones on before I stopped shivering." The Latin root, <i>pilare</i>, means "to strip of hair."</p></div></div>`;
