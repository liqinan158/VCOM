It's basically a group of green pigments used by organisms that convert sunlight into energy via photosynthesis.</p><p class="long">First used in 1819, the noun <i>chlorophyll</i> derives from the Greek words <i>khloros,</i> meaning "pale green" and <i>phyllon,</i> meaning "a leaf." Plants use chlorophyll to trap energy from the sun. Without this energy, plants would be unable to initiate the process of photosynthesis, which converts water and carbon dioxide into starches that plants can use for food.</p></div>`;
