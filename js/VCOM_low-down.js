If you get the <i>low-down</i>, that means you have the inside scoop. So, if you're playing poker with a <i>low-down</i> cheater, get the  <i>low-down</i> so you can outsmart him!</p><p class="long">If voters object to one candidate's low-down campaign methods, they'll probably vote for the opponent â€” or decide not to vote at all. And some basketball fans might complain that pretending to be fouled by another player is a low-down trick, although a common one. You can also use <i>low-down</i> to describe bluesy jazz or to mean "the inside scoop." When you visit an unfamiliar city, you can get the low-down on fun activities from your friend who lives there.</p></div>`;
