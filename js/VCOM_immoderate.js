Immoderate spending results in arms full of shopping bags and a whole lot of credit card debt, and immoderate eating at a huge breakfast buffet can give you a stomach ache for the rest of the day. <i>Immoderate</i> is the opposite of the adjective <i>moderate</i>, which means calm or restrained. Both words have the same Latin root, <i>moderatus</i>, "within bounds, or observing moderation."</p></div>`;
