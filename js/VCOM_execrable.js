Not surprisingly, the word comes from a Latin word meaning "to utter a curse; to hate or abhor." Tough words for bad art. Perhaps part of the power and nastiness of <i>execrable</i> lies in the word's similarity to <i>excrement</i> â€” but that's a vocabulary word we're not touching in this entry!</p></div>`;
