A sign with the shape of a dog inside a circle and a slash drawn through it is a <i>pictograph</i> that means "no dogs allowed."</p><p class="long">Anything that conveys information using just pictures can be called a <i>pictograph</i>. When you click on an icon on your computer, that's a pictograph, and when you text an emoji to your friend, that's another kind of pictograph. Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs and early Chinese characters are also pictographs, or symbols that represent various words. <i>Pictograph</i> comes from the Latin <i>pictus</i>, "painted," and the Greek <i>graphe</i>, "writing."</p></div>`;
