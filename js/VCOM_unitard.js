A unitard is intended to fully cover the wearer's body while still allowing for complete flexibility — it's ideal for contortionists and gymnasts. The word itself comes from <i>leotard</i>, which was named for Jules Léotard, an 1880s French trapeze artist. <i>Unitard</i> has the prefix <i>uni</i>, "having one only," because it's a complete one-piece outfit.</p></div>`;
