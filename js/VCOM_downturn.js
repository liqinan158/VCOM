If a company makes less money than it did last year, for example, that's a <i>downturn</i>.</p><p class="long">You'll often find the word <i>downturn</i> in business or economic news, describing the country's entire economy, or the activity of a particular sector of the economy. If car sales decline, that's a downturn, and if fewer homes are sold, it's a downturn in the housing market.
