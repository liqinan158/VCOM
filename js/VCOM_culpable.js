If you are culpable of a crime, you are the culprit, or the one who did it. <i>Culpable</i> can be used when looking for the root of the problem rather than a simple who done it. If a teacher leaves the room during a difficult test, and the students decide to cheat, parents might ask whether or not the teacher was also somewhat <i>culpable</i> for the outcome.</p></div></div>`;
