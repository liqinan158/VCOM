Although many people use the word <i>dice</i> when they're talking about a single die, it's actually only correct to call two or more of the dotted cubes <i>dice</i>. You can also use the word as a verb to mean "chop into tiny pieces or cubes." You might, for example, read a recipe instruction that says: "<i>Dice</i> three tomatoes."</p></div></div>`;
