The priest of a church in the English countryside might live in a nearby <i>parsonage</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Parsonage</i> literally means "house for a parson," and a parson is the member of the clergy, mainly in the British Anglican church, although Lutherans often use this terminology too. Other names for a parsonage include <i>rectory</i>, <i>clergy house</i>, or <i>vicarage</i>. One of the perks of being a priest in a small, rural church would be getting to live in a charming parsonage.</p></div>`;
