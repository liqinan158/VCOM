It was created by gluing the French prefix <i>neo-</i> onto the Greek <i>logos</i> or "word." People coin neologisms all the time, linguists track which ones stick, and eventually, we all feel they're old friends. Or maybe not: random samples from words coined in 2003 include: <i>adultolescence</i>, <i>pastability</i>, <i>pre-zactly</i>, and <i>neomaxizoomdweebie.</i></p></div>`;
