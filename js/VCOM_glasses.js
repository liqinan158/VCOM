Some people need <i>glasses</i> to see far-away things, while others only use <i>glasses</i> for reading. And some people wear <i>glasses</i> just to look stylish or smart!</p><p class="long">Most glasses have a stiff frame with prescription lenses inside. If your vision is less than 20/20 — if you have trouble reading what a teacher writes on a blackboard or find yourself holding your book very far away from your face to make out the words — you might need glasses. You can also call them "spectacles" or "eyeglasses," or if you only wear them to shield your eyes from the sun, "sunglasses."</p></div>`;
