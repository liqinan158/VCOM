If you find a <i>seashell</i> on the beach, think of it as a tiny abandoned home of a sea creature.</p><p class="long">You can also call a seashell a <i>shell</i>, although "sea" distinguishes ocean shells from those of freshwater mollusks. If you've ever walked on a beach, you've seen seashells, and maybe even collected some to take home (after checking to make sure no tiny creatures were living inside). Clams, snails, and oysters are all examples of animals that live in seashells. One of the most famous mentions of this word appears in the tongue twister: "She sells <i>seashells</i> by the seashore." Try saying that ten times, fast!</p></div>`;
