Dictionaries are in general content to stop their explanation of the origins of <i>pied-a-terre</i> by simply translating it, as if this were sufficient to explain how it inherited this meaning. On the other hand, it would hardly be a home if you didn't have your foot on the ground there some time.</p></div>`;
