Be kind to your <i>croupier</i>.</p><p class="long">You’ll find examples of this French word in casinos: a croupier runs a gaming table. If you want to play blackjack or another game of chance, you’ll have to deal with the croupier, who accepts bets, pays off successful bets, collects on losing bets, and looks out for anyone cheating. The croupier is like the boss of the table, keeping things running smoothly. While the dealer is more concerned with the game, the croupier is concerned with the money.</p></div></div>`;
