It was once common to use <i>pewter</i> to make lidded tankards for drinking and large cauldrons for cooking.</p><p class="long">Pewter is a metal alloy, which means it's a combination of several kinds of metal. There's always tin and copper in pewter, and it once commonly included lead, which we now know is dangerous for humans to consume. As a result, much antique pewter tableware isn't considered safe to use, although it's an attractive decoration. Pewter made today doesn't contain lead, but it's still most often used in candlesticks, picture frames, and other decorative objects.</p></div>`;
