Any similar billowy mass is also a <i>cloud</i>, like a cloud of smoke over your campfire or a cloud of dust after your car peels out of the driveway. If you're gloomy or morose, someone might say there's a cloud over you â€” a figurative cloud of sadness. On the other hand, if you're "on <i>cloud</i> nine," you couldn't be happier.</p></div></div>`;
