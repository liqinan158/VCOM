An insuperable difficulty is not just difficult; it’s impossible.  And an insuperable obstacle is not like a hurdle on a running track that slows you down a little; it stops you entirely. The opposite of <i>insuperable</i> is, of course, <i>superable</i>, though it’s less commonly used than its negative counterpart.</p></div>`;
