Soda fountains, carriages pulled by horses, and typewriters are all old-fashioned as well. These things are either not currently popular, or they're just plain old. There is also a whisky-based mixed drink called an <i>old-fashioned</i> which is still served in many stylish bars and restaurants.</p></div>`;
