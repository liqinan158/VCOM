var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">knavish</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the word <i>knavish</i> to describe someone who is mischievous, like a rascal or a hooligan. Their <i>knavish</i> behavior might seem playful, but it can be dangerously thoughtless.</p><p class="long">Since the 14th century, this adjective has been used to mean "low or vulgar" or "like a knave" though both <i>knave</i> and <i>knavish</i> are rarely used these days. A knave was originally simply "a boy." As time went on, the word gained negative connotations, meaning "rogue or rascal" by the 1200s. So anyone who acts in a rascally way — playing pranks, being disobedient, or teasing little kids — is knavish.</p></div>`;
