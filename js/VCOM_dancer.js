The <i>dancers</i> at a rock concert often look like they're enjoying the music most of all.</p><p class="long">You can be a dancer at your cousin's wedding reception, or a dancer in a professional ballet corps. Though the second example requires a much more serious commitment than the first, they both require you to move your body rhythmically, usually accompanied by music. In Old French, <i>dancer</i> means "to dance," and its origin is somewhat uncertain. One theory connects the word to the Old Frisian <i>dintje</i>, which means "tremble or quiver."</p></div>`;
