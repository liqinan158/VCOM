Or the locals may speak a pidgin version of English to communicate with you. Most pidgins include various elements of different languages in addition to the primary source of vocabulary — but they're all made up. The word <i>pidgin</i> is thought to derive from a Chinese pronunciation of the word <i>business</i> as "bigeon" and eventually "pidgin."</p></div>`;
