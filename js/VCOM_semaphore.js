The place you're most likely to have seen a semaphore is a railroad crossing: the gadget with moving arms is a semaphore. Some semaphores have mechanical arms, while others just use lights to communicate. A semaphore system can also use flags. In all cases, semaphores give visual signals that communicate something important, especially to people traveling.</p></div></div>`;
