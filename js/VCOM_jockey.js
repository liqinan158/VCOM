Being a <i>jockey</i> is an excellent career choice for someone small.</p><p class="long">Jockeys, usually male, are always small people, weighing less than 120 pounds and generally standing no more than five feet five inches tall. This keeps the horses' total weight light, allowing them to run faster. When <i>jockey</i> is used as a verb, it means "to struggle or compete," like when politicians jockey for dominance or kids jockey to be the first in line for a bouncy house. <i>Jockey</i> was originally a Scottish word for "boy."</p></div>`;
