You're not alone. Even newspapers and magazines have sections where the editors can <i>retract</i> something written that was incorrect.</p><p class="long">The sense of the word <i>retract</i> meaning to draw back or withdraw comes from the mid-16th century, and its meaning was clear when Napoleon Bonaparte said, "In politics...never retreat, never <i>retract</i>...never admit a mistake." Still, sometimes you wish you could retract something you said or did. Cats can retract their claws, and some snakes can retract their fangs, but words spoken in anger can never be fully retracted, or taken back.</p></div>`;
