Theyâ€™re like towels with sleeves and a belt. Fuzzy slippers and curlers are optional.</p><p class="long">A bathrobe shuttles you between being dressed and undressed. You might wear a bathrobe before or after taking a bath, in a locker room after swimming, or in a fancy spa. Bathrobes generally tie loosely around the waist, and because they're made of toweling, you can put them on when your body is wet. A more lightweight robe you wear over your pajamas can also be called a <i>bathrobe</i>, though it's more commonly called a "housecoat" or a "dressing gown."</p></div>`;
