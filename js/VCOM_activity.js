For example, you might search for the best activity on the cruise ship to fill your afternoon â€” shuffleboard, anyone? If you take the article away, and you refer to <i>activity</i>, you are usually referring to action. If there is too much activity on the cruise ship dance floor, you might want to avoid that zone.</p></div></div>`;
