These come from Latin <i>tenere</i>, which means "to hold." <i>Detain</i> is specifically used when you're talking about holding someone so they can't go anywhere. It's often used in discussions involving the police who detain people who they think might be guilty. But you can use <i>detain</i>, say, when you're explaining why you were late: "I was detained at the office by a conference call that wouldn't end. Sorry."</p></div></div>`;
