If you've ever been to a wedding reception, you've probably seen a <i>tipsy</i> person.</p><p class="long">Your aunt who gets a little tipsy on New Year's Eve might giggle more than usual, for example. You can also describe an inanimate object as tipsy, if it's wobbly or unstable, or even a little crooked. <i>Tipsy</i> comes from <i>tip</i> and its meaning of "slope or overturn." The old-fashioned verb <i>tipple</i>, to drink alcohol, came later. In the 1800's, a "<i>tipsy</i> cake" was one soaked in alcohol.</p></div>`;
