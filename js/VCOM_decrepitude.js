In other words, they are worn out and in disrepair.</p><p class="long">Decrepitude is usually a result of old age or neglect. Elderly people can be in this state and so can things, such as homes and automobiles. Similar words, which also happen to start with the letter <i>D</i>, are <i>dilapidation</i> and <i>deterioration</i>. Haunted houses featured in the movies are good examples of decrepitude. Most of them are not new and shiny, but have peeling paint, creaking floorboards, and lots of cobwebs.</p></div></div>`;
