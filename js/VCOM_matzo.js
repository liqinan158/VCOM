When <i>matzo</i> is ground into a flour, it can be used to make <i>matzo</i> balls for soup.</p><p class="long">During the Jewish holiday of Passover, observant Jews don't eat anything that's leavened, like yeast bread that rises before being baked. Matzo is a good, if crispy, substitute for bread, and it's unleavened. Matzo is also symbolic, representing both freedom and humility. It's sometimes spelled <i>matzoh</i> or <i>matzah</i>, from the Hebrew <i>matztzah</i>, "unleavened bread," or literally, "juiceless."</p></div></div>`;
