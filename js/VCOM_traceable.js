A poison that can be discovered in the body of a murder victim, for example, is a traceable poison. The word can also be used in the sense of something that can be tracked, such as a suspicious money transaction that’s traceable to your bank account. If something is traceable, it has left you a trail to follow it.</p></div></div>`;
