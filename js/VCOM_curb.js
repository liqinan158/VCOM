A <i>curb</i> is the edge of the sidewalk beside the road.</p><p class="long">When you're using the word <i>curb</i> as a noun, it's the raised edging beside a street. When <i>curb</i> is a verb, it means to restrain or hold back, like when you curb your impulse to laugh while watching a badly acted play. <i>Curb</i> comes from the Latin word for "curve," <i>curvus</i>, which describes the shape of a restraining strap on a horse's head â€” in the fifteenth century, this band was called a curb.</p></div></div>`;
