Gardeners spend a lot of time digging in the <i>dirt</i>, planting seeds and pulling up weeds.</p><p class="long">Dirt is the fine rock that makes up soil, but it also means anything unclean: "Do something about the dust and <i>dirt</i> in this room before our guests arrive!" When you know something embarrassing about another person, especially juicy gossip, you can call that information <i>dirt</i> as well — this meaning was coined by Ernest Hemingway in 1926. The word comes from the Old English <i>drytt</i>, "mud, dirt, or dung."</p></div>`;
