Most plays, movies, and novels include a <i>peripeteia</i> that keeps the reader or audience interested in the story.</p><p class="long">In the fairy tale "Hansel and Gretel," the moment when the witch reveals herself to be evil, rather than a kind old woman living in a house made of candy, is a classic peripeteia. The twist in the story provides an exciting conflict for the main characters and keeps the reader on the edge of their seat. <i>Peripeteia</i> is a Greek word that means "a turn right about" or "a sudden change," from <i>peri</i>, "around" and <i>piptein</i>, "to fall."</p></div></div>`;
