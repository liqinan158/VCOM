If you replace a word in a sentence with its synonym, the meaning of the sentence won't really change that much.</p><p class="long">There are, of course, shades of meaning, and not every synonym is an exact substitute, but sometimes we just need a different word for a change. Some words have dozens of synonyms, such as <i>funny</i>: <i>amusing,</i> <i>hilarious,</i> <i>laughable,</i> <i>slapstick,</i> <i>witty,</i> and many others. Other words, sadly, have no synonyms, like <i>postmodernism</i>. Check your thesaurus (dictionary of synonyms) â€” it's all there!</p></div></div>`;
