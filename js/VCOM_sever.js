If your girlfriend breaks up with you on your anniversary, you might respond by <i>severing</i> the blossoms off the roses you were planning to give her. (Just an idea.)</p><p class="long"><i>Sever</i> rhymes with <i>ever</i>, but it looks like the word <i>severe</i>, which means "harsh." The similarity between <i>sever</i> and <i>severe</i> is a good reminder to reserve <i>sever</i> for harsh, unpleasant circumstances. If you’re trimming your fingernails, you might use the word <i>clip</i>, but <i>sever</i> wouldn’t be appropriate. If, however, you somehow cut off your finger while clipping your fingernails, you’re free to use the word <i>sever</i> — or any other word you like — on your way to the hospital.</p></div></div>`;
