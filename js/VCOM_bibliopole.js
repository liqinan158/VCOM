If you’re looking for a hard-to-find old book, find a <i>bibliopole</i>, probably busy at work in a used bookstore.</p><p class="long">The word <i>bibliopole</i> is from the Greek <i>biblion</i> for "book" and <i>poles</i> for "seller." The meaning is clear, but a bibliopole isn’t just a regular bookseller, it’s someone who sells second-hand or rare books. Looking for a copy of William Blake’s <i>Illustrations of the Book of Job</i> (1825)? Find a bibliopole. And a big stack of cash. Looking for the latest bestseller? Go to any ol’ bookstore and leave the bibliopoles alone. Most bibliopoles are bibliophiles — people who love books.</p></div></div>`;
