Many children have a strong <i>belief</i> that the Tooth Fairy really does exist.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>belief</i> replaced the Old English word <i>geleafa,</i> meaning “belief, faith,” in the late 12th century. A belief is an idea one usually holds with conviction and importance. In a religious context, the Ancient Greeks held the belief that many gods existed, controlling their fate, while Christianity began with the belief that only one God exists. You can also have belief in yourself in the face of a challenge.</p></div></div>`;
