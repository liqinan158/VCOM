It often refers to the legislative branch of a nation's government, such as the US <i>Congress</i>, but it can also refer to any important meeting or official organization.</p><p class="long">While the word <i>congress</i> inevitably brings to mind the governing <i>Congress</i> with a capital <i>C</i>, there are many different kinds of congresses. The potato farming community, for example, convened the first World Potato Congress in 1993, and the United States Bowling Congress formed in 1995 when the men's and women's bowling organizations joined forces. <i>Congress</i> comes from the Latin <i>congressus</i>, which fittingly means both "friendly meeting" and "hostile encounter."</p></div>`;
