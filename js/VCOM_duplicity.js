His mouth said one thing, his feet said another.</p><p class="long">Many words with "du" have meanings with "two" or "duo." <i>Duplicity</i> is from a Latin word meaning "twofold, having two parts." Someone who shows duplicity is two-faced — maybe showing one side in public and another in private — or is just a liar, saying something known to be untrue or misleading. A fraud uses duplicity to gain something with false promises, and someone described as "fake" might use duplicity just to fit in or be accepted.</p></div>`;
