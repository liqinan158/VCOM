You might try for <i>redemption</i> by attempting to buy back a bike you sold, or you might attempt to buy back your soul after you steal someone else’s bike.</p><p class="long"><i>Redemption</i> comes from the Latin word <i>redimere</i>, a combination of <i>re(d)-</i>, meaning “back,” and <i>emere</i>, meaning “buy.” <i>Redemption</i> is what some people claim happens to your soul when you're saved from evil forces. You might pray for redemption — to the tooth fairy, to Zeus, or to some other kind of invisible being — in the hopes that an all-powerful being can save your soul. <i>Redemption</i> can also refer to the repayment of a debt.</p></div></div>`;
