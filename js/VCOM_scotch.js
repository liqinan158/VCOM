Instead, it means to prevent or stop something from happening.</p><p class="long">To <i>scotch</i> is, most often, to prevent plans, efforts, or desires — as opposed to things — from coming about. You wouldn't say, for example, "turning off the flame is one way to <i>scotch</i> the steak." But you might say, "Our plans for spending the weekend camping in the mountains were <i>scotched</i> by the blizzard. No camping for us." Think of <i>scotching</i> as similar to throwing a wrench into someone's plans. Drinking Scotch is one way to scotch your efforts to remain sober.</p></div></div>`;
