In a given school day, you're sure to notice the <i>periodicity</i> of the bells ringing after class at predictable, regular intervals.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>periodicity</i> is almost always used in a scientific or technical context (in more casual conversation, you'd be more likely to say <i>regularity</i> or even <i>rhythm</i>). In nature, there are many examples of periodicity, from the daily sunrise and sunset to the phases of the moon and the recurrence of the seasons. <i>Periodicity</i> is closely related to <i>periodic</i>, from the Greek root <i>periodos</i>, "cycle."</p></div></div>`;
