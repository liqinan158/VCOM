The Latin prefix <i>con-</i> means "together" and <i>nubilis</i> means "marriageable," which itself comes from <i>nubere</i>, meaning "take as husband." <i>Nubere</i> is also responsible for the word <i>nubile</i>, which was coined in the 1640s to describe a woman who was considered "marriage material." Today, it refers to a young, attractive woman."</p></div>`;
