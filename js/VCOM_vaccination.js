If you want to protect yourself from catching the mumps, you will need to undergo a <i>vaccination</i>.</p><p class="long">If you've ever gotten a bad cut or stepped on rusty metal, your doctor has probably asked when you last had a Tetanus shot. A Tetanus shot is a vaccine, a protective dose of medicine that keeps you from getting sick. Some common vaccinations protect against the flu, measles, and whooping cough. The word <i>vaccination</i> comes from <i>vaccine</i>, "related to cows," because the first vaccines, developed to prevent smallpox, were made from a virus called cowpox.</p></div></div>`;
