Farmers and gardeners set up "scare<i>crows</i>" to keep <i>crows</i> away from their seeds and crops.</p><p class="long">A crow is glossy and dark, a close relation of the raven, and a large group of crows is known as a <i>murder</i>. When a crow caws, you can also say it crows â€” and another way to crow is to call out with satisfaction about something: "I'm so proud of the award I just want to crow about it all day long!" The Old English root of <i>crow</i> is <i>crawe</i>, which imitates the sound a crow makes.</p></div></div>`;
