Or they go after the same thing you may want, like victory in a competition or even the parking spot you were waiting for.</p><p class="long">In earlier history, during the Middle Ages, a challenger was mostly a dreaded foe or someone who wanted to fight to the death with a sword. Some challengers want to challenge the truth or rightness of something, and that can be pretty serious too. In modern times, though, the word <i>challenger</i> often describes competitors who want to challenge each other in sports, on TV game shows, or in arguments. These challengers enjoy the challenge itself.</p></div></div>`;
