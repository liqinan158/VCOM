One gets <i>mired</i> IN something â€” like in a dispute or in a love triangle.</p><p class="long"><i>Mire</i> still has its original, though less-used, sense of a slushy, muddy bit of land that gives way underfoot, also known as a <i>quagmire.</i> One of the most famous mires in literary history was the one haunted by the Hound of the Baskervilles in Conan Doyle's classic. Have the fibs you told your beloved come back to haunt you? You're stuck in a mire then, a treacherous situation it's going to be pretty hard to squirm out of.</p></div>`;
