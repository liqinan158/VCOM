If you see someone standing alongside the highway raising a thumb, chances are that person is <i>hitchhiking</i>, not just expressing approval of your driving style.</p><p class="long">In the past, it wasn't unheard of for people to hitchhike across the country, but it's much less common today. If you hitchhike, you typically stand beside a road or highway with one thumb pointed up. The hope for a hitchhiker is that a car will stop and its driver will provide a free ride. While for many people, hitchhiking was once considered a reasonable way to travel, today it's illegal in some places and generally thought of as dangerous. The word <i>hitchhike</i> dates from the 1920s.</p></div>`;
