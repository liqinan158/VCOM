What's more surprising is that so are the baby anteaters in the zoo, as well as the offspring of sea lions, gerbils, and mongooses, among others. Sometimes this noun is also used to mean a young person who's particularly naive or arrogant. <i>Pup</i> comes from <i>puppy</i>, from the Middle French <i>poup√©e</i>, "doll."</p></div></div>`;
