In Christianity, the term "good news" refers to the story of Jesus Christ's birth, death, and resurrection. Gospel music is heard in church and sung by a gospel choir. Outside of its application to religion, the word <i>gospel</i> is also used to describe an idea or rule that's accepted as undoubtedly true.</p></div></div>`;
