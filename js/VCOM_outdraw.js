In other words, he would pull his gun from its holster faster and live to tell the story.</p><p class="long">People sometimes also use the verb <i>outdraw</i> to mean "attract a larger crowd" — like the World Series might outdraw your favorite prime-time game show. The word <i>draw</i> has been used since around 1200 to mean "pull a gun out," and its Old English root <i>dragan</i> means "to drag or carry." And somewhere along the way, <i>draw</i> started to mean "attraction" — like the goody bags at the end of a birthday party are a big draw.</p></div></div>`;
