Translated from the Greek, by way of Middle Latin, <i>anarchy</i> means "without a leader," and that's what an <i>anarchist</i> is all about. Given that <i>anarchists</i> reject authority, it's not surprising that there are many types of <i>anarchism</i>, ranging from those that promote the perfect liberty of the individual to those that endorse communist or socialist ideas.</p></div>`;
