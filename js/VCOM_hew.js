You <i>hew</i> things every day with one swift swing of the axe, chopping and shaping wood.</p><p class="long">It's said that Paul Bunyan hewed the Grand Canyon by dragging his giant mythical axe behind him. But usually things are hewn with a little more purpose â€” with each chop and cut designed to shape, sculpt, or craft a final product. Take the axe out of the picture though, and this word takes on a different meaning. If you're trying to adhere to rules, stick to a budget, or conform to a certain tradition, you can use <i>hew</i>, too.</p></div>`;
