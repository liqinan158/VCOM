Try it! The root of <i>poet</i> can be traced back to the Greek <i>poein</i>, "to make." Some poets write in carefully metered, rhyming lines, while others compose looser prose poems or "free verse," and the very best poets convey something that's essential or true. The Romantic poet William Wordsworth described good poetry as “the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings.”</p></div>`;
