Your friends might be jealous that the bike you bought at a yard sale was so <i>affordable</i>.</p><p class="long">If you live in an affordable city, it means that rents aren't too high for most of its residents, and if you buy an affordable dinner for yourself, it doesn't cost too much. The adjective <i>affordable</i> can either mean "cheap," or it can imply that even if it's expensive, you have enough money to easily buy it. The verb <i>afford</i> is at the root, and its earliest meaning was "accomplish." Gradually, <i>afford</i> came to have the meaning "manage to buy."</p></div></div>`;
