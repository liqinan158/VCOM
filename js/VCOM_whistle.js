Trains have <i>whistles</i>, and the wind <i>whistles</i> too. The world is full of <i>whistles</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Whistle</i> is a word with several meanings, but they have in common a similar high-pitched, airy sound. This is different from most instruments. You can't tuba without a tuba, but you can whistle without a whistle. Sometimes people's teeth make a whistling sound by accident. Referees and traffic cops carry whistles to get people's attention. Other people whistle for many reasons: because they're impressed, see something they like, or just want to say, "Hey you!"</p></div></div>`;
