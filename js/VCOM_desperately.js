If faced with a life-and-death situation, you might fight <i>desperately</i>, using any means possible to overcome the obstacles and survive.</p><p class="long">The undercurrent of the adverb <i>desperately</i> is one of <i>despair</i>, which makes sense when you consider that it comes from the Latin <i>desperatus</i>, meaning "given up or despaired of." You can get a good sense of the word from its context in journalist Sheilah Grahamâ€™s statement, "You can have anything you want if you want it desperately enough. You must want it with an inner exuberance that erupts through the skin and joins the energy that created the world."</p></div>`;
