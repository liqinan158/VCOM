Sometimes the mouthpiece itself is also called an <i>embouchure</i>.</p><p class="long">Brass and woodwind instruments are all played by blowing into or across an opening, the embouchure. As a method of playing such instruments, embouchure is a way of holding your mouth-including lips, facial muscles, and teeth. This often involves buzzing your lips against the instrument's mouthpiece. <i>Embouchure</i> is a French word that means "river mouth" (from <i>bouche</i>, "mouth") and it used to actually refer to the mouth of a river.</p></div>`;
