If your parents are <i>supportive</i> of your dreams to become a chef, they might enroll you in cooking classes.</p><p class="long"><i>Supportive</i> is a snuggly word. Anything that supports you, or embraces you and holds you up is supportive. It can be physically supportive, like a girdle that holds your belly in, or emotionally supportive like a loving family or solid network of friends. A parent paying for a child's college bills is supportive financially. Things can be supportive, too â€” posts holding up a building are supportive. Being supportive is a good thing.</p></div>`;
