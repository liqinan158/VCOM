If you and three friends buy up all the toilet paper factories in the world, you will have a toilet paper <i>oligopoly</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Oligopoly</i> comes from the ancient Greek <i>oligo-</i>, for "few," and <i>pole</i>, for "merchant," but the term wasn't invented until the late 19th century. In an economic oligopoly, only a few producers control the supply of something (like steel, cars, or clown suits), and each one has a lot of influence over prices. <i>Oligopoly</i> might remind you of <i>monopoly</i>, which is when a single producer controls the whole market.</p></div>`;
