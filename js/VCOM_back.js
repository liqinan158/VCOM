You might have back pain, or stroke your cat's back. Your clothing also has a back, and you have a figurative back: "Get off my <i>back</i>, Mom!" You could request a table at the back of a restaurant and then lean against the back of your chair. You can also "answer <i>back</i>," or reply, or choose to back a friend's fundraising project â€” give her money, in other words.</p></div></div>`;
