var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">treacly</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the adjective <i>treacly</i> to describe something that has a sticky, sweet flavor. Your dad's chocolate pecan pie might be a little too <i>treacly</i> for your taste.</p><p class="long">Something that's way too sugary is <i>treacly</i>. Your little brother might love treats like fudge and caramels and syrupy soft drinks that just taste treacly to you. You can also use the word in a more figurative way, to talk about overly sweet talk or behavior, like the treacly language on a sentimental greeting card. <i>Treacly</i> comes from <i>treacle</i> — a British term for molasses — originally "an antidote to poison," from the Greek root <i>theriake</i>, "antidote for poisonous wild animals."</p></div>`;
