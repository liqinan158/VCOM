Similarly, enrichment is when something is made more valuable. A reading enrichment program improves education. When vitamins or nutrients are added to food, that's enrichment because it makes the food healthier. All types of enrichment are improvements; they leave things better than they were before. You can also say such enrichment has enriched your life.</p></div></div>`;
