var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">credulous</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">People who believe things easily without having to be convinced are <i>credulous</i>. Sales people are always hoping that someone <i>credulous</i> picks up the phone during a sales call.</p><p class="long"><i>Credulous</i> comes from the 16th-century Latin <i>credulus,</i> or "easily believes." A synonym for <i>credulous</i> is <i>gullible</i>, and both terms describe a person who accepts something willingly without a lot of supporting facts. Calling someone <i>credulous</i> can imply that the person is naive and simple. An individual isn't necessarily insulted by being called credulous, though, because some objects of belief, like religions and unicorns, come with a willing leap of faith for believing in what is unseen.</p></div>`;
