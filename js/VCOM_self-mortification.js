Most <i>self-mortification</i> is practiced by deeply religious people.</p><p class="long">In Christianity, self-mortification is called "mortification of the flesh," and it ranges from self-denial — like not drinking alcohol or fasting — to hitting one's own shoulders and back with a whip or strap. Self-mortification isn't practiced by all Christians, and it is a part of other religions as well, especially for very strict followers. The root word is <i>mortificationem</i>, "a killing, or a putting to death" in Latin — in other words, the killing of a person's desires through self-discipline.</p></div></div>`;
