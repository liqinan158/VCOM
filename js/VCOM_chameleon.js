var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">chameleon</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Look closely at that branch or leaf — you might be able to spot a <i>chameleon</i> hiding. These little lizards are able to change color and adapt to their backgrounds, blending in to hide from predators.</p><p class="long">The history of the word <i>chameleon</i> goes back to the Greek word <i>khamaileōn</i>, which meant "lion on the ground," maybe because of the creature’s somewhat scary face, or maybe because the ridge around the creature’s head looks something like a lion’s mane. In Old French it became <i>chaméléon</i>, which stuck. Today there are two acceptable spellings, <i>chameleon</i> and <i>chamaeleon</i>. We often use the word today to refer to a person who is changeable or inconsistent.</p></div>`;
