Use <i>oxymoron</i> to refer to a word or phrase that contradicts itself, usually to create some rhetorical effect.</p><p class="long">When Shakespeare's Juliet says, "Parting is such sweet sorrow," she is using an oxymoron; her apparently self-contradictory turn of phrase actually makes a neat kind of sense. <i>Oxymoron</i> is sometimes used to describe a word combination that strikes the listener as humorously contradictory, even if the speaker didn't intend it that way. The word <i>oxymoron</i> is itself an oxymoron; in Greek, <i>oxy-</i> means "sharp" or "wise," while <i>moros</i> means "foolish."</p></div>`;
