You might visit an art <i>gallery</i> to check out a row of paintings hung on its walls.</p><p class="long">There are a few kinds of galleries, but the first is a part of a house or building that's unusually long and narrow. A gallery also has some sort of purpose: in a theater, a gallery is a place where additional seats are located.  A gallery is also somewhere art is shown and sold.
