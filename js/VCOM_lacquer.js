The lacquer makes the wood glossy and protects it from scratches and nicks. In Eastern Asia, there is a tradition of making decorative objects called "lacquerware," boxes, buttons, and other items that are made of wood and coated in lacquer. <i>Lacquer</i> comes from a now-obsolete French word, <i>lacre</i>, a type of sealing wax, and is ultimately rooted in the Sanskrit <i>laksha</i>, "red dye."</p></div>`;
