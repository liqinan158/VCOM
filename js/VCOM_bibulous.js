A <i>bibulous</i> person, however, is someone who likes to drink alcohol.</p><p class="long"><i>Bibulous</i>, pronounced "BIB-you-luhs," comes from the Latin word <i>bibere</i>, which means "to drink." You may recognize this root in the verb <i>imbibe</i>, which often means "to consume alcohol."  As it applies to people, <i>bibulous</i> means "likes to drink alcohol." So don't make the mistake of using it to describe someone who seems to soak up information or understand complicated ideas quickly.</p></div>`;
