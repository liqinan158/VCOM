Turkeys and chickens use their <i>gizzard</i> to grind up food, often along with small stones they swallow.</p><p class="long">Some crustaceans and fish have gizzards, and so do birds, crocodiles, and alligators. Dinosaurs had gizzards too! If you've ever cooked a Thanksgiving turkey, you might recognize the gizzard as one of the parts that are removed before roasting, but in many cuisines the gizzard is a delicious treat. In a live animal, the gizzard performs the function of teeth, grinding food to make it more digestible.</p></div></div>`;
