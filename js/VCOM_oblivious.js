It can also mean being forgetful and absent-minded. The cartoon character Mr. Magoo is a perfect example of someone who is <i>oblivious</i>; his eyesight is so bad that he always gets himself into various scrapes and mishaps. For example, Mr. Magoo mistakes an airplane for a theater and instead of watching a movie, he takes a seat on a departing airplane!</p></div></div>`;
