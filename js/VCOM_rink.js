If skating around and around to blasting music is your thing, head to a <i>rink</i>.</p><p class="long">An ice rink has an ice-covered surface, benches for changing from shoes to skates, and often places to buy snacks. Roller rinks have skates for rent, a hard surface to skate on, and loud music. <i>Rink</i> first appeared in English in the 14th century, from the Scottish dialect. Though it comes from the Old French <i>renc</i>, "line or row," it was mixed up with <i>ring</i> at some point and came to describe the ring-shaped ice rink.</p></div></div>`;
