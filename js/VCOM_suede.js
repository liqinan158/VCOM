If you're anything like Elvis Presley, you're fond of your blue <i>suede</i> shoes and would prefer that people don't step on them.</p><p class="long">Suede is made from leather that's been rubbed to create a nap, or a slightly fuzzy texture. The softer underside of leather is generally used to make suede. Shoes, furniture, gloves, bags, and many other products are commonly made from suede, or from material that's made to look like suede. The word comes from the French phrase <i>gants de Su√®de,</i> or literally "gloves from Sweden."</p></div></div>`;
