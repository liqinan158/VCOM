If you want to <i>impose</i> your musical taste on your parents, play your tunes all day at top volume.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>impose</i> emerged in the 1580s, meaning "to lay on as a burden," which is very similar to the modern meaning. Governments often impose taxes, legal restrictions, and other burdensome things on citizens, for example. But you should remember what Confucius once wisely said: "Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire."</p></div></div>`;
