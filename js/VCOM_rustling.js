var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">rustling</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>rustling</i> is a gentle swishing sound, like the <i>rustling</i> of leaves in the trees on a breezy night.</p><p class="long"><i>Rustling</i> can be a noun or an adjective, in both cases describing the muffled sound of leaves or paper. A rustling in the pile of leaves in your back yard might turn out to be a squirrel, and your sister may wear a rustling taffeta gown to her prom — its heavy material brushing audibly against her legs as she walks. The origin of <i>rustling</i> is the verb <i>rustle</i>, which is probably imitative — in other words, a word that sounds like its meaning.</p></div>`;
