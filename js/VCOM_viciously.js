A bully might <i>viciously</i> shove a smaller child, knocking him to the ground.</p><p class="long">You might have seen someone delight in crushing a bug under his shoe â€” you can say that he does it viciously. You might also describe your angry little brother as viciously pummeling you as you pass by, if he's furiously hitting and kicking. <i>Viciously</i> comes from the adjective <i>vicious</i>, which originally meant "of the nature of vice, or wicked." The Latin root, <i>vitiosus</i>, means "faulty, defective, or corrupt."</p></div></div>`;
