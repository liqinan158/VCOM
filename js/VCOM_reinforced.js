So a good synonym for <i>reinforced</i> is <i>strengthened</i>. In high-traffic areas like school floors and stairwells, builders choose reinforced concrete, which has an internal structure of metal bars, because it will last longer. Your socks might have reinforced toes, meaning thicker fabric in that part, to prevent holes from forming.</p></div></div>`;
