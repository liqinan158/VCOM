Those pointed pieces of rock that dangle from the roof of a cave are called <i>stalactites</i>. Most <i>stalactites</i> are primarily made of limestone or lava. Bats? Flesh and blood.</p><p class="long"><i>Stalactites</i> are the mineral formations that hang down like rock icicles, while <i>stalagmites</i> rise up from the floor. The word <i>stalactite</i> comes from the Greek word for "dripping," <i>stalaktos</i>, which in turn comes from the verb <i>stalassein</i>, "to trickle," which is how stalactites are formed. Water comes down through the top of the cave, bringing rock minerals with it that eventually form those pointy stalactites.</p></div>`;
