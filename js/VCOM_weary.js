It can also describe being extremely bored and sick of something, like on a long drive, you might grow weary of your father's singing voice. As a  verb, <i>weary</i> means "to exhaust or wear out," like when the children you are babysitting weary you with their game of running away every time you tell them to get ready to leave the park.</p></div>`;
