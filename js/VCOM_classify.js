It’s fine to do this to inanimate objects, but doing it to people can be very wrong.</p><p class="long">The word <i>classify</i> contains the base word <i>class</i>, which means "category" and comes from the Latin <i>classis</i>, which actually referred to an army or group called to arms. It eventually came to mean "a group," and thus <i>classify</i> means "to group." As a security measure, you can also classify information that is not to be shared. Writer Ambrose Bierce once said, “The small part of ignorance that we arrange and <i>classify</i> we give the name of knowledge.”</p></div>`;
