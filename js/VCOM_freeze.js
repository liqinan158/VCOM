The little squares of water in an ice tray <i>freeze</i> and become ice cubes when you put them in your freezer long enough.</p><p class="long">Orange juice and grape drink freeze into popsicles, and puddles freeze overnight if the temperature drops enough. You can freeze things, too, as when you freeze leftovers to be reheated in a few days. People often tend to use this verb in an exaggerating way when they're feeling cold: "If you don't wear your gloves, your fingers will <i>freeze</i>!" The Old English root of <i>freeze</i> is <i>freosan</i>, "turn to ice."</p></div></div>`;
