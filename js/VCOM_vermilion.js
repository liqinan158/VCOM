You could describe your grandfather's reddish-orange scarf as <i>vermilion</i>.</p><p class="long">The specific pigment know as vermilion was originally made from mercury sulfide, a chemical compound that produces a deep red color. This kind of vermilion was most famously used in enameled Chinese lacquerware. However, you can use the word <i>vermilion</i> to describe anything that's a particularly deep, rich shade of red. The root word is the French <i>vermeil</i>, "bright red," from the Latin <i>vermiculus</i>, "a little worm," or the insect that was historically used to make red dyes.</p></div>`;
