Your dentist may <i>obturate</i> the hole where she performed a root canal. If she doesn't, you'll be in some serious pain.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>obturate</i> is really more formal or technical than an everyday word like "block" or "obstruct," but you can use it as a substitute if you want to. It's more often used to describe the mechanism of a firearm, in which a bullet is designed to obturate the inside of a gun's barrel, increasing the pressure with which it's fired. The Latin root, <i>obturat</i>, means "stopped up."</p></div></div>`;
