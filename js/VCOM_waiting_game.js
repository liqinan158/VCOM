Someone negotiating for higher pay might play a <i>waiting game</i> to see if their boss will offer more money.</p><p class="long">If one country's government makes a threat against another, the threatened country may react immediately, sending in military forces or cutting off economic aid. Another reaction would be to play a waiting game, simply waiting to see how real the threat is. A waiting game might also look like your refusal to accept a $10 allowance, holding out to see if your parents will increase it to $15. When a waiting game is successful, circumstances eventually change in your favor.</p></div></div>`;
