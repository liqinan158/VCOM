If an earthquake in Australia was <i>coterminous</i> with the earthquake in China, that means it caused the same amount of destruction.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>coterminous</i> derives from the Latin word <i>conterminus</i>, meaning "bordering upon, having a common boundary." When something is coterminous, it has the same boundaries, or is of equal extent or length of time as something else. The expansion of the American Old West was coterminous with the expansion of the Great American Frontier. Your mayor's term in office might be conterminous with increased access to social services.</p></div></div>`;
