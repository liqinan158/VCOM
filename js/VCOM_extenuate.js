The fact that you walked your little sister to school because she missed the bus might <i>extenuate</i> your teacher's response when you show up late.</p><p class="long"><i>Extenuate</i> goes back to the Latin verb <i>extenuƒÅre,</i> meaning "to thin" or "make thin." Someone might have a strong case against you for doing something wrong, but an added consideration can make less serious, or extenuate, the circumstances that led to it. If you give an excuse that doesn't really relate to what was done, it won't extenuate the punishment. If something has a real bearing on what went wrong, it will extenuate the response, and you'll get in less trouble.</p></div></div>`;
