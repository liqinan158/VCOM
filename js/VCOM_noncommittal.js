var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">noncommittal</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you want to keep all your options open, stay <i>noncommittal</i>. This means you say "maybe" and "I'll see if I can do that," rather than making promises to do specific things.</p><p class="long">It’s pretty easy to figure out the meaning of <i>noncommittal</i> just by picking apart the word. The <i>non-</i> prefix means “not.” And you see the word <i>commit</i> in <i>noncommittal</i>. So you know that the word is going to have something to do with “not commit.” You might also recognize the suffix <i>-al</i>, which is a tip-off that this word is an adjective that means "not being willing to commit."</p></div>`;
