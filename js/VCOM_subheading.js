Subheadings are usually printed in type that's smaller than the heading but larger than the text that follows. Newspaper subheadings also sum up the main theme of each separate section or paragraph of a story. The headline "Catnapper Apprehended" might be followed by the subheading "A Case of Mistaken Identity."</p></div></div>`;
