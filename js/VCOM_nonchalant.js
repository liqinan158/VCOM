Isn't that cool? Sometimes, a nonchalant person acts indifferent or uninterested, but really cares very much. If you give a girl a nonchalant smile, you definitely want her to notice you! Even though it begins with <i>non</i>, <i>nonchalant</i> has no positive form —  <i>chalant</i> is not a word.</p></div>`;
