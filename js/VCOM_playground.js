Most kids know where the nearest <i>playground</i> is because thatâ€™s where the swings and slides are. Neighborhoods and  schools usually have a <i>playground</i>.

Many public parks have this kind of playground. When adults talk about their favorite playgrounds, they usually mean a place they go to do the sports or activities they love.
