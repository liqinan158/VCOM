If you yell orders at your restaurant server and leave him a small tip, you're treating him with extreme <i>discourtesy</i>.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>discourtesy</i> is a formal way to say "rudeness" or "disrespect." Cutting in line, interrupting others, chewing with your mouth wide open, being late for an important meeting â€” these are all examples of discourtesy. <i>Courtesy</i> means "elegance of manners" or "politeness," from a root meaning "courtly manners." When you add the prefix <i>dis-</i>, "the opposite of," you get <i>discourtesy</i>.</p></div></div>`;
