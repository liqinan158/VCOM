Any common boundary or area of convergence can be an <i>interface</i>.</p><p class="long">Used as a verb, <i>interface</i> means to merge or mingle, bonding and synthesizing by communicating and working together.  The word <i>interface</i> is comprised of the prefix <i>inter</i>, which means "between," and <i>face</i>. In the 1960's, when computers first began to be commonly used, the word became familiar and now can simply mean “to meet.”  Although "Shall we interface over coffee?" still feels a bit awkward.</p></div>`;
