Your dad might gab over the fence with the neighbor, and you may sit in the front of the bus so you can gab with the friendly driver. You can also describe the chatter itself as <i>gab</i>. The oldest meaning of <i>gab</i> may come from thirteenth century Scottish dialect, "to reproach," although it may in fact be rooted in the Old French <i>gobe</i>, "mouthful or lump."</p></div></div>`;
