The speaker is delivering what is known as a <i>eulogy</i>. A <i>eulogy</i> is a formal speech that praises a person who has died.</p><p class="long">Usually a eulogy makes the dead person sound a lot more impressive than they really were. A couple of less common synonyms for this kind of "praise the dead" speech are <i>panegyric</i> and <i>encomium</i>. Sometimes the dead person was so unimpressive that there's nothing nice to say. And sometimes they were so awful that the only appropriate speech is a <i>dyslogy</i> that describes their faults and failings.</p></div>`;
