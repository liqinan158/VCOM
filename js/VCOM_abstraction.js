It can also refer to the state of mind in which a person is not paying attention to something but is lost in thought or daydreaming.</p><p class="long"><i>Abstraction</i> is the noun from the adjective <i>abstract</i>, which derives from the Latin <i>abstrahere</i> "to divert." From that, we can get the idea that an <i>abstraction</i> is something that is drawn away from concrete reality. In the art world, an <i>abstraction</i> is a painting or musical piece created in the style of expressionism, in which a subject is not realistically presented or even recognized, but rather is suggested by an emotional flow of paint or music.</p></div>`;
