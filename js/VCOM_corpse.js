You might hear the word on TV crime shows, but a <i>corpse</i> doesn't have to be a crime victim, just any lifeless body.</p><p class="long">The words <i>corpse</i> and "corps" are often confused, and with good reason â€” both came from the Latin word <i>corpus</i>, meaning "body," and up until the 19th Century, both referred to a dead person. Around that time, the word with the "e" at the end was established as the word for a person's remains, while the other spelling was relegated to a "body" of people working together or in a military division, and very much alive!</p></div></div>`;
