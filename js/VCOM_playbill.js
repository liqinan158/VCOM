A <i>playbill</i> usually includes a list of the cast and production crew.</p><p class="long">You can also call a playbill a <i>program</i>. At most theaters in the U.S., playbills are handed out to everyone in the audience as they enter. If you attend a Broadway play, you'll get a thick playbill with a lot of information about the play, the actors, and the venueâ€”as well as a lot of advertising. A community theater or school production usually provides smaller, simpler playbills.</p></div>`;
