Something that is cyclic follows a cycle, a sequence in which things begin and end in a predictable rhythm. <i>Cycle</i> comes from the Greek word <i>kyklos</i>, meaning "circle, wheel, any circular body, circular motion, cycle of events." So something that is cyclic shares that same pattern.</p></div>`;
