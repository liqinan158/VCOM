A room that is not well lit is <i>dim</i>, a slow thinker is <i>dim</i>, and when life looks hopeless, your prospects are <i>dim</i>.</p><p class="long">To dim a light is to dull it, like by putting a shade over it. A vague idea without a lot of specifics is also dim, since it's hard to see or understand the idea. Someone who's not very bright is dim or a dimwit. When things are hopeless, they're dim too. For example, if a football team is losing by fifty points, their chances of winning are dim.</p></div>`;
