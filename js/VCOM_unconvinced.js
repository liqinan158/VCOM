When it comes to music, people will often try to sway you to their way of thinking — that a band is THE band — especially if you remain <i>unconvinced</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>unconvinced</i> has <i>convince</i> as its base. The latter is from the Latin root words <i>com</i>, which is an intensifier, and <i>vincere</i>, which means "to conquer." The prefix <i>un</i> means "not." So <i>unconvinced</i> is "not conquered" or "not persuaded." If you are unconvinced that taking the new job is a good move, why not ask for more money or a corner office?</p></div></div>`;
