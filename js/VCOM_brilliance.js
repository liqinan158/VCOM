City dwellers might be surprised at the <i>brilliance</i> of the stars in the night sky the first time they go camping in the mountains.</p><p class="long">We can trace the noun <i>brilliance</i> back to a Latin root meaning "to shine like a precious stone," and now we use it do describe things that glow with light, shine with color, or sparkle with intelligence. The brilliance of your sister's red hair shining in the sun can't begin to compare with her brilliance on the school math team.</p></div></div>`;
