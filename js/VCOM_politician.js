A <i>politician</i> may start a career by running for a local office, like mayor, but could eventually serve nationally â€” in Congress or even as President.</p><p class="long"><i>Politician</i> can mean someone who identifies with a major political party. Sometimes voters prefer to elect candidates who aren't career politicians, with more allegiance to the party they represent than the people they serve. A general frustration with politicians has resulted in the use of <i>politician</i> to refer to people who act to gain an advantage for themselves. The office politician may lobby the boss to get preferential treatment, for example.</p></div>`;
