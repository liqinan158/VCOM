A <i>turncoat</i> is a traitor.</p><p class="long"><i>Turncoat</i> comes from the ancient practice of wearing a badge or pin on one's coat signifying the party or leader you supported. By "turning your coat" you quite literally hid your allegiance to others. Often used interchangeably with <i>defector,</i> and while they are similar they are not quite the same. <i>Turncoat</i> is worse: it implies no possibility of any good or honest motive. <i>Defector</i> can at least sometimes have a neutral or even positive implication.</p></div>`;
