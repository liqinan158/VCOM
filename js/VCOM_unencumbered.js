A person is unencumbered when they're traveling light — they're not struggling to carry 5 suitcases. But if you have no worries or responsibilities, you're also unencumbered — nothing is weighing on your mind. In both senses being unencumbered means you feel light: either literally or emotionally.</p></div></div>`;
