The word <i>debutante</i> is derived from the French word <i>debut</i>, meaning “a first performance or showing.” The original French word <i>debutante</i> referred to a new actress making her first appearance on the stage. So, think of a debutante as a young woman making her debut in society.</p></div></div>`;
