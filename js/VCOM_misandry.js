If your dog barks ferociously at every single man she encounters, you may wonder if she suffers from <i>misandry</i>.</p><p class="long">You're probably more familiar with the word <i>misogyny</i>, "hatred of women." However, misandry is also a prejudice based simply on a person's sex, and just like racism and other forms of bigotry, it's unfair. A boss's refusal to promote men may stem from misandry â€” or it may be because the women who work for her happen to be more highly qualified.</p></div>`;
