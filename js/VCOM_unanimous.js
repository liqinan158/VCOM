Just imagine if you let third graders vote on what to serve at lunch: Pizza and candy would be the <i>unanimous</i> choice!</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>unanimous</i> comes from the similar Latin word <i>unanimus</i>, which means “of one mind.” So when people think unanimously, they all have the same idea in their heads. A vote is unanimous when all voters are in agreement. Said Marcus Cicero, “Great is the power, great is the authority of a senate that is unanimous in its opinions.”</p></div></div>`;
