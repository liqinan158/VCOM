Hamlet's Ophelia was said to have been <i>clambering</i> on a weak branch of a willow when she met her "muddy death." It's never a good idea to <i>clamber</i>, let alone on weak willow branches.</p><p class="long">We associate the word <i>clamber</i> far more often with toddlers (than Shakespearean tragedy). Toddlers are known for naturally clumsy, ill-coordinated movements we deem cute not foolish. Suitably enough, the word comes from the delightful and long obsolete Middle English word <i>clamb</i>, meaning the past tense of <i>climb,</i> a word that has all the happy logic of a toddler's imagination.</p></div></div>`;
