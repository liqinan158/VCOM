And when you're planning a dinner party and your brother announces he's bringing five friends, you'll need to recalculate how much food to make. We can trace the verb <i>calculate</i> back to the Latin <i>calculus</i>, originally "pebble used as a reckoning counter." The prefix <i>re-</i> adds the sense of "do it again."</p></div></div>`;
