In the old days, teachers were allowed to flog misbehaving students, and it wasn't  uncommon for parents to flog their children as punishment. In fact, the word <i>flog</i> first appeared as school slang in the late 1600s â€” it's thought to be a shortened form of the Latin word <i>flagellare</i>, "flagellate," or "whip."</p></div></div>`;
