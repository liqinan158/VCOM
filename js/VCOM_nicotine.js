People who are addicted to cigarettes are really hooked on <i>nicotine</i>.</p><p class="long">Nicotine is most commonly known for occurring in tobacco, and therefore in cigarettes. In small amounts, nicotine is a stimulant, although in larger quantities it's considered a poison and is even used in many insecticides. The earliest French root of the word was <i>nicotiane</i>, which comes from the Modern Latin botanical term for the tobacco plant, <i>Nicotiana</i>, named for Jean Nicot, the French ambassador who first brought tobacco from Brazil to France in 1561.</p></div></div>`;
