And if two competing baseball teams have eleven wins apiece, it means that they're tied for the season so far â€” they've each won eleven games. <i>Apiece</i>, first used in the 1500s, was a contraction of <i>a pece</i>, which was almost always used to talk about coins or items for sale.</p></div>`;
