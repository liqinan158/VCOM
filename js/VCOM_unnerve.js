Haunted houses are meant to <i>unnerve</i> you — though there may be nothing that <i>unnerves</i> you more than the first day at a new school.</p><p class="long">The original meaning of <i>unnerve</i>, dating back to the 17th century, was "to destroy the strength of." The source of this definition was a now-obsolete meaning of <i>nerve</i>, "to give strength and vigor." Today when you unnerve someone, instead of destroying their strength, you destroy their composure — in other words, you make them nervous or uncertain.</p></div>`;
