It's a fitting word, as the valence of an element determines its strength — an idea that was first recorded in the later 19th Century. Since the word <i>valence</i> carries the idea of interaction, it can also be used to describe the amount of attraction or repulsion by people, either toward each other or an event.</p></div>`;
