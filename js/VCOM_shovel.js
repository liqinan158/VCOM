If you're taking your younger cousins to the beach, be sure to bring lots of pails and <i>shovels</i> so they can build a sandcastle.</p><p class="long">A shovel has a long handle and a wide, curved blade at the end. By pushing the end of the shovel into the ground and scooping, you can shovel out enough soil to make room for the treasure chest you want to bury. Shovels are useful for clearing snow from sidewalks and driveways too, and you can describe the amount of dirt carried in a shovel as a shovel (or shovelful) of dirt.</p></div>`;
