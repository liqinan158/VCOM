At the end of "The Wizard of Oz," you are left to decide if Dorothy really traveled to Oz or if she was simply in an <i>oneiric</i> state, dreaming up the whole adventure.</p><p class="long"><i>Oneiric</i> comes from the Greek word <i>oneiros</i>, meaning a dream. In Greek mythology, the Oneiroi, or Dreams, were the brothers (or sons, depending on the author) of Hypnos, or Sleep. Homer, Ovid, and Euripides all wrote about them â€” Homer in both the "Odyssey" and the "Iliad." The adjective <i>oneiric</i> is often used in film theory to describe the dream-like elements of a movie.</p></div>`;
