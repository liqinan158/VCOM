And that's not usually meant in a nice way. You probably wouldn't talk about Nelson Mandela and his ilk â€” <i>ilk</i> sounds negative. Usually, you're talking about a criminal and his ilk, or a crooked politician and his ilk. If someone is talking about your ilk, it might be time to get new friends or change your ways.</p></div>`;
