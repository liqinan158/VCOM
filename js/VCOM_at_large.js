You’re on the loose! <i>At large</i> is often used for criminals who have eluded the police, but your dog could be <i>at large</i> if you can't find her.</p><p class="long">Have you ever watched the news and heard something like, "A murder suspect is <i>at large</i>"? That's bad news, because it means they're not in police custody. People use this term when someone escapes from the police or hasn't been captured yet. You'll hear this term a lot on TV shows that involve crime. Bank robbers, muggers, and even lost dogs could all be at large. A criminal is at large until the police catch him.</p></div>`;
