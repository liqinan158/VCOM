If you give her a diamond bracelet, a racehorse, and an oil well, then you’re a <i>munificent</i> friend, meaning you are very lavish when it comes to giving gifts. (And it’s possible you may also be broke.)</p><p class="long">If you’re the generous type, you may already know that the word <i>munificent</i> traces back to the Latin word <i>munificus</i>, meaning “generous or bountiful," which in turn originated from the word <i>munus</i>, meaning “gift or service.” Put those two concepts together and you have big-time gift giving on a lavish scale. Use the word <i>munificent</i> to describe instances of over-the-top generosity — think Oprah on a gift-giving binge at Christmastime.</p></div></div>`;
