Then you're guilty of <i>defection</i> — the act of shifting your support to a new cause.</p><p class="long">Most people won't thank you for your defection. No matter how much you might believe in the new sports team, or political party, or whatever, <i>defection</i> is generally used as a critical term. Defection implies a lack of character — as you can tell by looking at its Latin roots, which come from the word <i>defectionum,</i> meaning "desertion, revolt, failure." Clearly, no one likes a defector.</p></div></div>`;
