You may go to a real estate company to get a <i>broker</i> to help you buy a house.</p><p class="long">In Middle English <i>broker</i> meant "peddler or retailer." Nowadays a broker still sells things — but she's acting as an agent making deals for someone else and collecting a commission for all that work. Used as a verb, <i>broker</i> means to arrange a deal or negotiate. Working for an advisory firm, a broker may convince you to invest in a company — so the broker would broker a business deal.</p></div></div>`;
