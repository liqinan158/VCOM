That’s a <i>recrimination</i>, an accusation or insult that’s hurled back at someone.</p><p class="long">If you’ve ever been in a verbal disagreement with someone, odds are that you’ve experienced recriminations.  You can remember it by noticing that <i>crim</i> as in "crime" is part of the word. When recriminations fly back and forth between two sides, each accuses the other of crimes in the metaphorical sense. Once the emergencies of a disaster have been taken care of, recriminations are sometimes hurled at those in charge for the way the crisis was handled.</p></div></div>`;
