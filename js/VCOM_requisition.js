No, we have no idea what he's doing in there.</p><p class="long"><i>Requisition</i> looks a little like "request" and, in fact, it comes from the Old French word meaning exactly that.  It can still be used that way, like when you make a requisition for a new office desk because the old one has three broken drawers.  If a police officer requisitions your car for use in a high speed chase, it will initially require less paperwork.</p></div></div>`;
