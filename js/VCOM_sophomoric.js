It was totally <i>sophomoric</i> of your friends to throw our clothes into the swimming pool.</p><p class="long">It's acceptable to use this adjective to mean "characteristic of or relating to a sophomore," so you could describe your sophomoric extracurriculars in high school, like marching band and chess club. It's far more common, however, for <i>sophomoric</i> to be derogatory, appropriate for describing your younger sister's ridiculous practical jokes or the class clown's antic. This word derives from contrasting Greek roots, <i>sophos</i>, "wise," and <i>m≈çros</i>, "foolish and dull."</p></div>`;
