Other things that bounce back at you are also <i>reflections</i> — light waves, sound waves, even your thoughts.</p><p class="long"><i>Reflection</i> comes from the Latin <i>reflectere</i>, made up of the prefix <i>re-,</i> "back," and <i>flectere,</i> "to bend." So it's bending something back: your reflection in the mirror is the light waves that bounce your image back at you. When you pause for reflection — serious thinking, that is — your thoughts are bending inward. Reflection can also be a consequence of something: the way your dog mopes around when you're away is a reflection of how much he misses you.</p></div></div>`;
