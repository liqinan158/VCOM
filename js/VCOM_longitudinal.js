Geographers also describe things as longitudinal, but instead they mean something that relates to the east-west measurement across the Earth. When doctors use the word, it's in yet another way, describing muscles or other body parts that run lengthwise, rather than up-and-down. <i>Longitudinal</i> comes from the Latin word <i>longitudo</i>, "length or duration."</p></div>`;
