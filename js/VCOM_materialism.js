What is material? Well, it's stuff â€” anything you can see and touch, like a pile of books or a big, green lawn. To be material, a thing has to have physical form, unlike emotions, beliefs, deep conversations, thoughts. So <i>materialism</i> means putting all importance on stuff. Someone who suffers from materialism would rather be out spending money than spending time with loved ones.</p></div>`;
