It's all kinds of sugar, and it's in your blood, and your body needs it for energy. Most Americans sadly consume far more <i>glucose</i> than necessary, and have enlarged gluteus maximus muscles to show for it.</p><p class="long">The word <i>glucose</i> is based on an ancient Greek word <i>gleukos</i> which meant "sweet delightful wine." When you're popping one glucose-laden Girl Scout Cookie after another into your mouth, you certainly do feel that delight. You'll probably see the word <i>glucose</i> plenty in biochemistry textbooks. Glucose needs to be in your blood, and a healthy balance of it in your body is indeed as delightful as wine to those ancient Greeks.</p></div></div>`;
