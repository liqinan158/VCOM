Often this applies to the sun, the moon, and the earth, but any planets can be in <i>syzygy</i>.</p><p class="long">To pronounce <i>syzygy</i>, accent the first syllable: “SIZ-eh-gee.” The most common occurrence of syzygy is when the sun, the moon, and the earth are lined up, which happens during the time of a new moon or a full moon. Syzygy can sometimes cause eclipses, and it also affects the tide. If you live in a different solar system, you can still use the word — it can apply to heavenly bodies anywhere that line up straight.</p></div></div>`;
