When politicians <i>equivocate</i>, they are often afraid of upsetting, and thus alienating, voters with their decisions.</p><p class="long">A key part of <i>equivocate</i> is the root <i>vocate</i>, which comes from the Latin <i>vocare</i> or "voice." When you give your voice to two opposing views in order to mislead or keep your options open, you're equivocating. Think of the expression, to talk out of both sides of your mouth. If you want to go to a party and your parents keep saying "maybe, it depends," tell them to stop equivocating and give you a straight answer.</p></div></div>`;
