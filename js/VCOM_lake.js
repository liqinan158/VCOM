The <i>lake's</i> water can be fresh (like Lake Michigan) or, more rarely, salty (like the Great Salt Lake). A <i>lake</i> is generally accepted as being bigger than a "pond."</p><p class="long"><i>Lake</i> is also a type of pigment or dye that is made when a dye that can dissolve is mixed with a metallic salt or other binder that is incapable of being dissolved, rendering an insoluble pigment. Indigo lake, for example, is a blue pigment that was originally made from the woad plant but later from the indigo plant. Carmine or crimson lake, on the other hand, is made from crushed cochineal insects and is a red pigment.</p></div></div>`;
