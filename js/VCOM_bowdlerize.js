If the hero in an R-rated movie adapted for TV  exclaims, “Oh shoot fudge darn!” but his lips seem to be saying something else, that movie has been <i>bowdlerized</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>bowdlerized</i> comes from the name of Dr. T. Bowdler, who decided to publish an edition of Shakespeare without sexual references or double-entendres (which is when a word has two meanings, one of them cheeky). Mr. Bowdler thought he was performing a great service for humanity, but generally if we call something bowdlerized, we’re implying that it was edited in a prudish way.</p></div>`;
