Most of the trash in a <i>junkyard</i> can be reused or recycled.</p><p class="long">Piles of rusted metal and smashed bodies of old cars are common sights at a junkyard. The word clearly comes from the <i>junk</i>, or trash, that's stored there â€” and although it is undeniably junky, it's also got some value to companies that recycle metal. Junkyards are also called "wrecking yards" or "scrapyards." A "<i>junkyard</i> dog" is a guard dog that keeps watch overnight in case thieves try to steal valuable metal.</p></div>`;
