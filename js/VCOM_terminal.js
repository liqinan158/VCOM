Depending on how it's used, it can describe a place where passengers end their journey, a computer screen and keyboard, or a life-ending disease.</p><p class="long">As a noun, <i>terminal</i> describes a bus or train station at the end of the line. When your aunt takes the bus into town, you pick her up at the terminal.

This is surprising news, since you've always believed your aunt is a hypochondriac. Now you have to go to your computer terminal and look up her disease.</p></div>`;
