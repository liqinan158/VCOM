If several dogs run onto the field during the big baseball game, tripping players and chewing up the bases, you can call the whole event a <i>debacle</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Debacle</i> is sometimes used to describe a military defeat. If your army retreats, that's one thing. If your army is outmaneuvered and ends up huddled in a valley, surrounded on all sides by the enemy, forced to sing 70s sitcom theme songs by their savage captors––that's a debacle. <i>Debacle</i> comes from French <i>débâcler</i> "to clear," from Middle French <i>desbacler,</i> from the prefix <i>des-</i> "completely, utterly" plus <i>bacler</i> "to block."</p></div>`;
