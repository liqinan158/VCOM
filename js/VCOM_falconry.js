It involves wearing a cool claw-proof glove and getting giant birds to hunt for you. A young King Arthur practices <i>falconry</i> in “The Sword in the Stone.”</p><p class="long">Historians believe that the sport of falconry may have started in ancient Mesopotamia. To practice falconry, you need a falcon that's trained to hunt small animals and return to its handler, or <i>falconer</i>. If a hawk or eagle is used instead of a falcon, the sport is still called <i>falconry</i>, but the handler is an <i>austringer</i>. The words <i>falconry</i> and <i>falcon</i> come from the Latin root <i>falx</i>, "curved blade," which can describe the shape of a falcon's talons, beak, or spread wings.</p></div>`;
