The <i>commons</i> in the middle of a village might be a green space that's available for gatherings and celebrations.</p><p class="long">One way to think of the commons is as public land or space â€” roadways, town parks, public beaches, and sidewalks could all potentially be defined as part of the commons. Nobody owns the commons, and when some part of it becomes privately owned, it's called <i>privatization</i>. The word <i>commons</i> comes from the Latin root <i>communis</i>, which means both "in common, shared by all, or general," and also "common property."</p></div>`;
