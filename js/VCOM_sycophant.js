Also known as brown-nosers, teacher's pets or suck-ups.</p><p class="long"><i>Sycophant</i> is from Latin <i>sycophanta,</i> from Greek <i>sykophantÄ“s,</i> from <i>sykon</i> "fig" and <i>phainein</i> "to show, make known." The original sense was that of an informer, a person who gives information about criminal activities. "Showing the fig" was a vulgar gesture made by sticking the thumb between two fingers. The gesture was used to taunt an opponent or to make an accusation against someone.</p></div>`;
