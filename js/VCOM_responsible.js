And, if things go poorly, it's all your fault.</p><p class="long">Sounds like a drag to be <i>responsible</i> but really it is what we all want out of life. After all, when you're <i>responsible</i>, you get the keys to the car, you make your own decisions, and you get all the credit. Parents love the <i>responsible</i> babysitter who doesn't text with her friends and feed the kids bowls of ice cream. Of course, the boy who is <i>responsible</i> for bringing firecrackers to the football game will not be looked upon with the same level of respect. Responsibility can bring all the glory, but all the blame too.</p></div></div>`;
