If the baby's family is rich, that baby spoon might very well be made of silver â€” in a way it represents the luxury and ease of the rest of the baby's life, especially compared to those who were fed from regular plastic spoons. The phrase seems to be American in origin, and it was first used around 1800.</p></div>`;
