Winning a big award makes most people <i>jubilate</i>.</p><p class="long">While it's more common to hear the noun <i>jubilation</i>, or "joy," you can use the verb <i>jubilate</i> when you talk about showing that joy. Your parents might jubilate on the occasion of their wedding anniversary, and your whole town will probably jubilate at the news of a new, fancy public swimming pool.
