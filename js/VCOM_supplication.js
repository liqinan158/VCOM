The word carries a sense of awe and adoration with it, suggesting something tentative, even servile, a respectful appeal to a higher power.</p><p class="long">Although it is a noun, <i>supplication</i> comes from the Latin verb <i>supplicare</i>, which means "to plead humbly." While a <i>supplication</i> is often thought of as a religious prayer (it is used 60 times in the Bible), it can logically be applied to any situation in which you must entreat someone in power for help or a favor. Still, it carries with it an aura of religiosity and deep entreaty, and should not be used to describe just any simple request.</p></div></div>`;
