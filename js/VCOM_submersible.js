Anything that functions in the water can be described this way, including a submarine, which is sometimes actually called a submersible. The word comes from the Latin <i>submergere</i>, "to plunge under or sink," from the root words <i>sub</i>, "under," and <i>mergere</i>, "to plunge or immerse."</p></div></div>`;
