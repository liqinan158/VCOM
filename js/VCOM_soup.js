If you have a sore throat, your grandma might make you a nice bowl of chicken noodle <i>soup</i>.</p><p class="long">Most soup is made by cooking vegetables, beans, meat, or fish (or a combination of these) in water for a long time. Sometimes soup is thickened with cream or flour, or by pureeing some of the ingredients. Certain soups, like gazpacho and vichyssoise, are served cold, and others are sweet and made with fruit. You may hear people describe a dense, thick fog as "pea <i>soup</i>" or use the phrase "<i>soup</i> to nuts" to mean "everything."</p></div></div>`;
