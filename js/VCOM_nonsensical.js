When you're really angry, you might hear yourself sputtering <i>nonsensical</i> sounds and have to stop, take a breath, and start again.</p><p class="long">Lewis Carroll's poem "Jabberwocky" is full of great examples of nonsensical words, like "mimsy," "frumious," and "slithy," which manage to be both descriptive and completely nonsensical. Something that is utterly ridiculous or absurd can also be described as <i>nonsensical</i>. You might tell your best friend, "I know you like crazy hats, but that thing on your head is completely <i>nonsensical</i>."</p></div>`;
