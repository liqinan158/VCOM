If you can't remove a tiny splinter from your finger, over time some <i>suppuration</i> may occur around it.</p><p class="long">Use the noun <i>suppuration</i> when you need a nice clean medical term for the formation of pus, the white substance that sometimes oozes from a sore or a pimple. Suppuration can happen because of an infection or skin irritation. The Latin root is <i>suppurare</i>, "to form or discharge pus," from <i>sub</i>, "under," and <i>pus</i>, which literally means "matter from a sore," and figuratively, "bitterness or malice."</p></div></div>`;
