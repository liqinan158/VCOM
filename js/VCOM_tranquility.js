How do you reach tranquility? Make peace with yourself, your life, and the people who drive you crazy. Tranquility can also come from spending time alone, like reading in front of the fireplace on a snowy afternoon. Meditation and yoga can help bring tranquility, by clearing your mind of constant worries.</p></div>`;
