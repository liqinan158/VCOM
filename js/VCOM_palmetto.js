You're most likely to see <i>palmettos</i> in South America or the southern US states, instead of say Nebraska.</p><p class="long">A palmetto (the "cabbage <i>palmetto</i>, to be specific) is Florida's official state tree, and South Carolina is known as "the <i>palmetto</i> state." Palmettos are fan palms, with leaves in the shape of fans that are arranged in a rounded shape. The very middle of the palmetto plant is edible, and when it's harvested and sold as food, it's called "heart of palm." <i>Palmetto</i> comes from the Spanish <i>palmito</i>, "little palm tree."</p></div>`;
