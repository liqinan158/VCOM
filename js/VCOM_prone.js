var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">prone</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If you're <i>prone</i> to doing something, it means you're likely to do it, have a habit of doing it, or are susceptible to it. People who are <i>prone</i> to getting the flu every winter should probably get a flu shot in the fall.</p><p class="long">The second meaning of <i>prone</i> is "lying face down," and the Latin root is <i>pronare</i>, "to bend forward." This is a handy way to remember both meanings: if you tend to wait to start your term paper until the night before it's due, you are prone to procrastination â€” you bend toward it.  If you stay up so late you fall asleep face down in the book, you are now prone at your desk.</p></div>`;
