Once known as a disease of the wealthy and gluttonous, <i>gout</i> can be exacerbated by eating rich, fatty foods.</p><p class="long">Gout sounds like an old-fashioned condition, and it is often associated with famous historical figures who suffered from it, like King Henry VIII and Alexander the Great. However, it's fairly common today, possibly due to high-fat diets and longer life expectancies. The word <i>gout</i> comes from a Latin root <i>gutta</i>, or "drop," from the ancient belief that it was caused by drops of "humors" spilling into the joints from the blood.</p></div></div>`;
