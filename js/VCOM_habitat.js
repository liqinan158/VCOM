Zoos usually try to mimic the <i>habitats</i> of the animals they keep, housing bats in a nocturnal house and monkeys in a cage with trees to climb and swing from.</p><p class="long">The origins of <i>habitat</i> aren't exactly what you would expect. The word goes back to the Latin <i>habitare</i> meaning "to live or dwell," which itself goes back to <i>habere</i> meaning "to have or own." It seems logical that if you own a place, it is your home. <i>Habitat</i> is usually used with animals and plants that live in and are adapted to a specific environment. In nature, orchids and banana plants live in a warm, humid habitat.</p></div></div>`;
