Sometimes things that people don't want others to hear become <i>audible</i>, such as a growling stomach during a quiet moment at the movies.</p><p class="long">Coming from the Latin <i>audīre,</i> "to hear," <i>audible</i> is an adjective meaning "heard" or "hearable." A scream is audible, a barking dog next door is audible, and a siren is audible. Why do some writers use the expression "a barely <i>audible</i> whisper?" Isn’t that what a whisper is — something you can barely hear?</p></div></div>`;
