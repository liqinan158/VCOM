You could describe a flu shot as a <i>safeguard</i> against getting sick, for example.</p><p class="long"><i>Safeguards</i> protect against something negative, whether it's an attacking army invading a country or a boy you don't like much asking you to the prom. A store's security system is a safeguard against theft, and a secret password is a safeguard against your sister reading your email. You can use it as a verb too: "We clearly need to <i>safeguard</i> our Halloween candy so Mom and Dad don't steal it after we go to bed."</p></div>`;
