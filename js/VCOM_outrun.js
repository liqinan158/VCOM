Your lazy cat might enjoy hunting for mice, although the mice always seem to <i>outrun</i> him in the end.</p><p class="long">You can outrun an opponent in a race, and you can also watch a video game character outrun a pursuing zombie â€” <i>outrun</i> can also mean "escape from." Your dog might enjoy chasing cars, never managing to outrun them. More figuratively, you can say that your hopes always outrun the reality of a situation. In other words, what you dream of exceeds what actually happens.</p></div>`;
