A rainbow shows the melting of one hue into another, from red to violet, and all shades in between.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>hue</i> means both a color and a shade of a color. Green is a hue, and turquoise is a hue of both green and blue. Most of the time the word <i>hue</i> refers to colors, but sometimes it's used for shades of meaning or even the tone of a person's face, as in "The speech had a <i>hue</i> of politics — disguised with humor — that turned the mayor's face from a pale <i>hue</i> to red as he laughed."</p></div>`;
