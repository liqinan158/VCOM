It might sound a little funny, but go ahead and describe your one year old cat as a yearling. The word combines <i>year</i>, from the Old English <i>gear</i>, and the diminutive suffix <i>-ling</i>, which is often used in words describing young animals, like <i>gosling</i> and <i>duckling</i>.</p></div></div>`;
