var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">intently</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If you're studying something <i>intently</i>, you're probably leaning forward and you're oblivious to whatever is going on around you. Your attention is focused like a laser.</p><p class="long">If you're gazing intently into someone's eyes, you're hanging on to every blink of the eye, every nuance of expression. Maybe you're in love. When you do something intently, you do it with intensity. It's not a coincidence that <i>intently</i> sounds a lot like <i>intensity,</i> as they both come from the Latin <i>intendere,</i> made up of <i>in-</i> ("toward") and <i>tendere</i> ("stretch"). So when you're listening intently to a Bart√≥k string quartet, you're stretching and straining to hear every note.</p></div>`;
