It's great to see a friend who's always struggled in school <i>overcome</i> his learning disabilities and make the honor roll.</p><p class="long">You can also be <i>overcome</i> with emotions, or overwhelmed by your feelings. Many people feel so overcome with sadness at a movie — or happiness at a wedding — that they regret not bringing a pile of tissues with them. The verb <i>overcome</i> also means to win or surpass. If you are going to win the marathon, you are going to have to overcome the five runners still ahead of you.</p></div>`;
