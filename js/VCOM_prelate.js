Both Catholic and Protestant religions have <i>prelates</i> in their ranks.</p><p class="long">The source of <i>prelate</i> is the Latin adjective <i>praelatus</i>, "noble," whose meaning is appropriate to the modern meaning, a high-level church dignitary. The word was applied to those high-ranking clergymen around the beginning of the 13th century, the Middle English coming from the Middle French <i>prelat</i>. As the church's importance increased, so did the importance implied by the word <i>prelate</i>. Ambrose Bierce referred to a <i>prelate</i> as "one of Heaven's aristocracy."</p></div></div>`;
