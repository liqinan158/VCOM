It's so relaxing to take a slow walk in the misty rain, listening to water <i>droplets</i> fall on your umbrella.</p><p class="long">A droplet is a smaller version of a <i>drop</i>, which you can tell from the diminutive suffix <i>-let</i>, "smaller" (think <i>booklet</i> and <i>piglet</i>). If you're perspiring lightly on a hot day, you'll have droplets of sweat on your forehead, and if you accidentally turn on the spray attachment in the kitchen sink, you should dry those water droplets on the counter. Don't worry too much, though â€” the main thing to know about droplets is that they're tiny.</p></div>`;
