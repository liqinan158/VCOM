How are you doing? <i>Hello</i> is a salutation or greeting commonly used to begin conversations or telephone calls.</p><p class="long"><i>Hello</i> has been used as an English greeting since the 19th century. Most agree that it is related to the older French exclamation “Holà” — which means essentially “Ho there!” — like you might say to a horse to tell it to stop. Nowadays it’s still used to get someone’s attention but instead of stopping you’re starting something — usually a chat. <i>Hallo</i> and <i>Hullo</i> are variations of <i>Hello</i> used by British English speakers.</p></div>`;
