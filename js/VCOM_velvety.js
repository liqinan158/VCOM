It’s one of the smoothest fabrics. That’s why you can use the word <i>velvety</i> not only for things that are like velvet, but for anything smooth, whether it’s a texture, sight, or sound. The soft fur of a puppy is velvety. A lounge singer’s gentle voice is velvety. A drink that goes down easily is velvety. If something is rough, jarring, jagged, or sharp in some way, it’s the opposite of velvety.</p></div></div>`;
