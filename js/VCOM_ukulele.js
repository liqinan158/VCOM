Most <i>ukuleles</i> have four strings and are light enough to be strummed by anyone, including kids.</p><p class="long">The ukulele, or <i>uke</i>, as it's frequently called for short, comes in four standard sizes: soprano, concert, tenor, and baritone, and even more less-common variations. The larger the uke, the deeper and louder its sound. Some ukuleles are even double-strung, with a total of eight strings. A good ukulele player's fingers move extremely fast, which explains its name, which means "leaping flea" in Hawaiian.</p></div></div>`;
