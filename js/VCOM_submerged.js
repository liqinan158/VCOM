The flood in your basement might cause your exercise equipment to be submerged, and you probably snorkel with your face submerged. You can also use <i>submerged</i> to describe something that's covered up. For example, you might try to keep your sad feelings about your dog's death submerged when you're with your friends.</p></div></div>`;
