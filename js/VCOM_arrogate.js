When the teacher steps out of the classroom and some bossy student marches up to the chalkboard and begins scolding the other kids? The student is trying to <i>arrogate</i> the teacher's authority.</p><p class="long">When someone takes control of something, often without permission, such as when a military general assumes the power of a country's government after getting rid of the previous leader, they arrogate power or control to themselves. Occasionally the verb <i>arrogate</i> means something like "assert one's right to," or take something that is deserved, but more often it implies a taking by force.</p></div></div>`;
