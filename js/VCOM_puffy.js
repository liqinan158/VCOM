Big, round clouds are puffy, and so are the white seed heads of dandelions â€” the puffy balls you can blow on and make a wish. Wind is puffy too, when it blows in little gusts. This is the earliest meaning of <i>puffy</i>, from <i>puff</i> and its Old English root <i>pyffan</i>, "to blow with the mouth."</p></div>`;
