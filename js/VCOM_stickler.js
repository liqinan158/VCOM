Say you’re getting married and want to write your own vows, but your partner’s mother demands that you have a traditional ceremony. The mother is a <i>stickler</i> for tradition.</p><p class="long"><i>Stickler</i> has its origins in a word meaning umpire, which may allude to a stickler’s bossy nature. Difficult problems or puzzles are called sticklers. It is helpful when remembering the definition of <i>stickler</i> that it has the word “stick” in it. So someone who “sticks” to the rules is a stickler.</p></div>`;
