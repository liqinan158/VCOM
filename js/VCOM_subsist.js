Since most airlines have stopped serving food, many travelers are forced to <i>subsist</i> on little packets of pretzels, even on long flights.</p><p class="long">To subsist is to feed yourself, or keep yourself going, especially when you just barely manage to do so. A hunger striker might subsist on only water for weeks, and people in developing countries often have to subsist on small rations of rice  or grain. <i>Subsist</i> comes from the Latin word <i>subsistere</i>, "to stand firm," but sometimes subsisting makes people feel like they are barely standing, rather than firmly standing.</p></div></div>`;
