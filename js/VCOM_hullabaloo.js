Anything of real importance — a war, a murder, for example — merits a more serious term like "disturbance" or "outcry." <i>Hullabaloo</i> allegedly comes from the sound of lots of people saying "Hullo!" Hullo!" In other words, it's an onomatopoeic word, that is to say it sounds like its meaning, like <i>hiss</i> or <i>tick tock</i> or <i>oink</i>. Curious fact: there's no plural to hullabaloo: <i>hullabaloos</i> is not a word.</p></div>`;
