It can describe a plant whose leaves pair off in opposing buds or anything — a government, a relationship — that has two divisions that are sharply opposed.</p><p class="long">The relationship between science and mysticism, or astrology and astronomy, for example, are two examples of a dichotomous relationship: each side has a completely irreconcilable set of basic principles. You might say the same about a father and son who support different baseball teams. Not surprisingly, the word <i>dichotomous</i> comes from the ancient Greek word <i>dikhotomia</i>, meaning "a cutting in half." So be warned and make sure your children grow up supporting the same team as you.</p></div>`;
