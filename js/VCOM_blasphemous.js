If you draw Jesus Christ wearing lipstick or call Buddha a fat slob, you're displaying <i>blasphemous</i> behavior.</p><p class="long"><i>Blasphemous</i> comes from a Greek word that means “evil-speaking,” but actions as well as words can be blasphemous.  Spitting on a cross, drawing pictures in the Qur’an, tripping a rabbi—all of these are rude in general, but because they combine a sacred religious person or thing with rude behavior, they're also blasphemous.  Beyond religion, any attack on something you cherish is blasphemous, like when your best friend says your celebrity crush is ugly.  Such blasphemous words!</p></div>`;
