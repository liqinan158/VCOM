A beehive hairdo is not so <i>modern</i>, though depending on the wearer, it could still be hip.</p><p class="long">When talking about time, <i>modern</i> is used to mean what's happening right now. Texting your friends rather than calling them is modern. A modern building is more likely to be made out of glass and steel than bricks. In art, however, <i>modern</i> has a more specific meaning, as it defines a style of art produced from the 1860s to the 1970s and includes everyone from Monet to Miro. To be correct, use contemporary to mean art that is being created now.</p></div></div>`;
