An <i>astrological</i> reading gives you advice based on the exact moment of your birth.</p><p class="long">If someone asks, "What's your sign?" she probably wants to know your astrological symbol, so if you were born in the middle of October, you might reply, "My <i>astrological</i> sign is Libra." Originally, <i>astrology</i>, the root of <i>astrological</i>, meant the same as <i>astronomy</i>, the real science of celestial bodies. By the 17th century, <i>astrology</i> meant only "reading influences of the stars," similar to its Greek root, <i>astrologia</i>, "telling of the stars."</p></div>`;
