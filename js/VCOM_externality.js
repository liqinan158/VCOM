A snow storm for example, is an <i>externality</i> that can cause delays at the airport.</p><p class="long"><i>Externality</i> comes from the Latin root word <i>externus</i> meaning "outside" or "outward." An externality is something on the outside that affects other things.  Often an externality is a behavior or result of behavior by one party that affects others who have no choice in its happening.  For example, factory pollution is an externality that can affect people's health and well-being. It's outside of their control and yet it has an impact on their lives.</p></div>`;
