var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">fawning</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use <i>fawning</i> to describe someone who's over the top in the flattery department. Like a <i>fawning</i> admirer who just won't stop complimenting your looks, showering you with gifts and otherwise kissing the ground you walk on.</p><p class="long">From the Old English <i>fægnian</i>, meaning “rejoice, exult, be glad,” <i>fawning</i> can be both an adjective and a noun form of the verb <i>fawn</i>. Fawning people are often trying to win favor with the person being flattered, and it sometimes comes off as sucking up. So do everyone a favor and don't try to boost your poor grades by fawning over your professor’s every word.</p></div>`;
