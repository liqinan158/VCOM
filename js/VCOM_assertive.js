People who are <i>assertive</i> aren't as aggressive as those who are <i>demanding</i> and <i>pushy</i>, and they can negotiate a little better than those who are <i>insistent</i>. Use <i>assertive</i> to describe someone who is self-confident enough to make bold statements and forceful actions. The word can also be applied to nonhuman things, like policies and strategies.</p></div></div>`;
