The <i>liveliness</i> of a kindergarten class might be a little overwhelming to a brand-new teacher.</p><p class="long">Anyone or anything with liveliness is full of excitement, activity and energy. If you're in search of liveliness on a Friday night, you're more likely to find it at a party or a rock concert than at a sad movie or a solemn poetry reading. We can trace the noun <i>liveliness</i> back to the word <i>life</i>. So if you meet someone who's full of life, its their liveliness that you're noticing.</p></div></div>`;
