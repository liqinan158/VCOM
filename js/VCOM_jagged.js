Teeth can be <i>jagged</i>, saw blades can be <i>jagged</i>, and the edges of leaves can be <i>jagged</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Jagged</i> comes from 16th century English/Scottish and originally referred to a cloth, cut in a way so that the edge is not straight, but that is “toothed.” Imagine a tipsy seamstress trying to cut cloth in a straight line, but her sheers stray this way then that. She’s leaving a <i>jagged</i> edge on the cloth. Or perhaps you have a crush on the seamstress, but she is seen kissing another. Here, she’s leaving a <i>jagged</i> wound on your heart.</p></div>`;
