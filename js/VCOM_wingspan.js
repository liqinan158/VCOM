An eagle has a much larger <i>wingspan</i> than a sparrow.</p><p class="long">Anything with two wings has a wingspan, which is one way to get a sense of its size. So birds and butterflies can be measured for wingspan, but so can airplanes. A flying squirrel can have a wingspan of over a foot, and some hummingbirds have wingspans that are barely over an inch. Sports commentators often mention the wingspan of basketball players â€” in this case, they're referring to the distance between a player's outstretched fingertips.</p></div></div>`;
