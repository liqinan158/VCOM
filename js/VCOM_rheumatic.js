If your grandfather moves slowly, you could describe him as <i>rheumatic</i>.</p><p class="long">You could describe a doctor as "a <i>rheumatic</i> expert," or a patient as moving in a rheumatic way, slow and arthritic. The Latin root word is <i>rheumaticus</i>, "troubled with rheum," and <i>rheum</i> itself is a Greek word that means "flow." The word was first ascribed to the disease of rheumatism because of the way it seemed to spread — or flow — within a patient's body.</p></div>`;
