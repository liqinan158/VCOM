Find yourself deeply contemplating whether the new polka dot paint job really brightened up your kitchen? Then you are looking at those dots with an <i>evaluative</i> eye.</p><p class="long">At the core of the word <i>evaluative</i> is <i>value</i>. When you judge something, you are determining its value â€” like the value of a mathematical equation. Though both <i>value</i> and the related verb <i>evaluate</i> have some place in math classes, you will more often encounter <i>evaluative</i> in situations that call for critical thinking and judgment. So you will probably want to rewrite the boring ending before an editor turns her evaluative pen on it!</p></div>`;
