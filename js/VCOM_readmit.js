A hospital might readmit a patient who's been released only to have their symptoms get much worse. And colleges often readmit students who've taken a leave of absence. <i>Readmit</i> uses the "again" prefix <i>re-</i>, with <i>admit</i>, from the Latin root <i>admittere</i>, "to allow to enter."</p></div>`;
