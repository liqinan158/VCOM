If you see a <i>fissure</i> in the ice on a frozen lake, you'll want to take off your skates and head back to the car.</p><p class="long"><i>Fissure</i> has its roots in the Latin word <i>fissura</i>, meaning a cleft or crack. If something breaks into fine cracks, you can describe the action with the verb form of <i>fissure</i>. For example, "She watched in horror as the earth <i>fissured</i> beneath her feet, recognizing the signs of an earthquake but powerless to do anything to save herself except throw herself to the ground and hang on."</p></div></div>`;
