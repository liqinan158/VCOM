A captivated student is enthralled by her teacher's history lesson, and a captivated audience is involved in every word spoken on stage during a play. The word is rooted in the Late Latin <i>captivare</i>, "to take or capture," which in turn comes from <i>capere</i>, "to seize." When something seizes your attention, you are captivated.</p></div>`;
