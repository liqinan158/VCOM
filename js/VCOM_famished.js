Either you have a death wish or you're extremely hungry — <i>famished</i> that is.</p><p class="long">Tracing the roots of <i>famished</i> leads us to the Middle English word for "starve." So it's no wonder <i>famished</i> means absolutely starving or totally ravenous. Just think of all those poor famished people in the Middle Ages, with only porridge and vegetables to eat and not a fast food chain in sight. It's enough to make you cry...or reach for another french fry — depending on how famished you are.</p></div></div>`;
