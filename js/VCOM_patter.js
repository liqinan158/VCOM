On a rainy night, you might love lying in bed listening to the rain <i>patter</i> on the roof.</p><p class="long">You can describe the way rain patters, or the way children's feet patter down the hallway on Christmas morning. The light, quick sound itself is also a <i>patter</i>: "Listen to the <i>patter</i> of sleet on the window!" Informally, a salesman's pitch can be called <i>patter</i> as well, from an older meaning, "talk rapidly," from <i>pater</i>, "mumble prayers rapidly." The tapping kind of <i>patter</i> has a different root, which it shares with <i>pat</i>.</p></div></div>`;
