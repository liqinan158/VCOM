If your kitchen is undergoing a <i>renovation</i>, there’s probably plaster and paint all over the place and you should probably get take-out.</p><p class="long">The roots of <i>renovation</i> refer to newness and doing something again — it’s from the Latin <i>re-</i> for "again" and <i>novare</i> which means, "make new.” A rundown building is in need of renovation, or a website that's being redesigned is under renovation. After renovation, things look new and improved. Before the word underwent renovation, in the early 15th century, <i>renovacyoun</i> meant "spiritual rebirth,” which is how you might feel after your kitchen is redone.</p></div>`;
