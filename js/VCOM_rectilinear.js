A square and a rectangle are both <i>rectilinear</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Rectilinear</i> is used to mean "straight," so if something moves in a straight line, it has rectilinear motion. A photographer's rectilinear lens reflects images accurately, so their straight lines don't appear curved. This word comes from the Latin root <i>rectus</i>, meaning "straight." In geometry, the meaning goes beyond that â€” a rectilinear polygon has straight sides that meet at a 90 degree angle. So from your geometry teacher's perspective, a rectangular speed limit sign is rectilinear but an octagonal stop sign is not.</p></div>`;
