If you want a movie to end, you long for its <i>surcease</i>.</p><p class="long">This word can be used as a noun or verb, but either way it means something is finished. If you surcease working, then you finished your homework for the day. Many people hate when their sleep comes to a surcease in the morning. If a clumsy dentist is causing you pain, you might yell "Surcease! Surcease!" That just means "Stop it!" In life, everything surceases eventually. This is a word youâ€™re likely to see in poetry and other formal writing.</p></div>`;
