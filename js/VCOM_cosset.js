Your temptation might be to cosset small children or elderly relatives, pampering them and shielding them from difficulty. In the 17th century, <i>cosset</i> had the additional sense of "fondle and caress," as you might cuddle a baby or a puppy. Earlier, the word was a noun meaning "a lamb raised as a pet."</p></div>`;
