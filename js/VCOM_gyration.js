The <i>gyration</i> of a whirling amusement park ride might leave your head spinning long after you get off.</p><p class="long">A hula hoop whiz is an expert at gyration, whirling the hoops around their hips, arms, and legs (maybe all at once â€” that's a lot of gyration!). This kind of fast, circular movement is what gyration is all about, from an old verb, <i>gyre</i>, "rotate or revolve." In math, a gyration is a very specific type of rotation. When a sphere rotates around a point that's not at its center, it's an example of gyration.</p></div>`;
