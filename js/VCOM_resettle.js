It's hard to <i>resettle</i> in a place where the language and culture are completely unfamiliar.</p><p class="long">An immigrant is someone who resettles in a new country. Sometimes people resettle to escape poverty or war, and other times they move to be with a family member or take a new job. You can also use this verb to mean "help someone move to a new place," so a government might resettle refugees in various cities. It can also have a negative connotation, as when a government forces groups of people to resettle in a new region.</p></div></div>`;
