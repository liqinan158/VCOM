var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">bough</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>bough</i> is a large branch from a tree. You know: “When the <i>bough</i> breaks, the cradle will fall...” A “lullaby” about a baby careening to the ground from a broken branch? (Nice.)</p><p class="long">The original “Hush-a-bye” rhyme, some scholars say, was modified in America to reflect pilgrim children’s observations of Native American mothers hanging cradles from tree branches so that the wind would rock their babies to sleep. Why do poets use <i>bough</i> when <i>branch</i> and <i>limb</i> mean the same thing? Well, maybe because more words rhyme with <i>bough</i> than with those others. Also, “holly boughs” and “blossomy boughs” sound much more musical than “branches.” What rhymes with <i>branches</i>? Cattle ranches?</p></div>`;
