A <i>curable</i> illness or disorder can be treated and recovered from.</p><p class="long">A bad infection can be scary, but it's most often curable with antibiotics. There are even types of cancer that, while serious, can be treated and are therefore considered curable. Another meaning of <i>curable</i> is "able to be hardened, or cured." You might apply several coats of a curable coating after sanding and staining your dining room table. The Latin root is <i>cura</i>, "care or concern," and also "means of healing."</p></div></div>`;
