Your <i>geographic</i> location is your region, or your neighborhood — it’s where you are on a map.</p><p class="long">Anything related to geography can be called geographic. A geographic study might examine the composition of some soil. A geographic class teaches students about physical processes like erosion. A volcanic eruption is a major geographic event. A geographic divide refers to different things happening in different places –- like a geographic divide in the U.S. that notes that people say “y’all” down South and “you guys” up North.</p></div></div>`;
