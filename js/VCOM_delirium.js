Then you're out of your mind and so excited you're hallucinating. Many things can cause <i>delirium</i>, including illness, high stress, and your team winning the World Series after 100 years of trying.</p><p class="long"><i>Delirium</i> means “madness” in Latin, and for good reason. Patients with high fevers or who suffer severe trauma might experience a state of delirium, full of mental confusion and maybe a little hysteria. And if you’ve ever stayed up all night writing a paper or working hard to meet some deadline, you’ve probably experienced moments of delirium, where you feel crazed and hallucinatory, fueled by sleep deprivation and too much coffee.</p></div></div>`;
