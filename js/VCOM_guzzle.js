After running a marathon, you might be tempted to <i>guzzle</i> Gatorade, but it's important to sip slowly so you don't get sick.</p><p class="long">If your brother somehow manages to drink an entire gallon of milk in two days, he guzzles it. And, if your big old car needs to be refueled several times a week, you can say it guzzles gas. Experts guess that the root of <i>guzzle</i> is the Old French word <i>gosillier</i>, which means "to go down the gullet," but also "to vomit."</p></div>`;
