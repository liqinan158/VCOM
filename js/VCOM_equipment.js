A circular saw? A solar panel? Depending on what you’re up to, all these things can be considered <i>equipment</i>, which is whatever you need to complete a task.</p><p class="long">Right away you probably notice that a big chunk of the word <i>equipment</i> is made up of another word, the common verb <i>equip</i> — meaning "to provide someone with the tools they need for a specific task." Add <i>equip</i> to <i>-ment</i> (the suffix of choice when you want to turn a verb into a noun) and voilà! Like magic, the verb changes into a noun, and you end up with <i>equipment</i>: the materials you get when you are equipped to do a particular thing.</p></div></div>`;
