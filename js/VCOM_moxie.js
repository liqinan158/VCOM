A boxer needs moxie in order to get up after being punched in the face, and a computer programmer who spends years building a video game has a lot of moxie.  The word <i>moxie</i> comes from a soft drink named <i>Moxie</i> that tastes like sugary cough medicine and claimed it would “build up your nerve.”  Someone who is brave enough to drink an entire can of that curious beverage clearly has moxie.</p></div>`;
