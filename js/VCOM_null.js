Or if it was, it’s gone now. Because <i>null</i> is basically nothing, zip, zilch, nada, and nix. What could be worse? Maybe being "<i>null</i> and void," which is a legal term making something really, really null. <i>Null</i> is the base of the word <i>nullify</i>, which means to make something invalid or to cancel something out.</p></div>`;
