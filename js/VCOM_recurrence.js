The word <i>recurrence</i> has to do with things that repeat or return, often at predictable times. If your dog barks at the same time every day, your neighbors might complain about the recurrence of noise. A note on using this word: <i>reoccurrence</i> means basically the same thing, but <i>recurrence</i> is considered a more stylish choice.</p></div>`;
