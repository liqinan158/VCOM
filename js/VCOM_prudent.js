If you're getting in trouble, it is probably <i>prudent</i> to keep your mouth closed and just listen.</p><p class="long">If you show good and careful judgment when handling practical matters, you can be described as prudent. Similarly, a wise and well-thought-through decision or action can be called prudent. The word comes from a contracted form of the Latin <i>prōvidēns</i>, from the verb "to foresee." The English word <i>provident</i>, "wise in planning for the future," is the non-contracted descendent of the same Latin root.</p></div>`;
