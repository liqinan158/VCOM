It means either a novice — a person just learning the ABCs of something — or it can describe something arranged alphabetically.</p><p class="long">The word comes from the Latin <i>abecedarius</i>, which means "alphabetical," based on the names of the first letters of the Latin alphabet. The word <i>alphabetical</i>, too, is based on the names of the first letters of the alphabet — but the Greek alphabet, which begins "alpha, beta." <i>Abecedarian</i> can also mean rudimentary. Sherlock Holmes might have said, “Abecedarian, my dear Watson.”</p></div></div>`;
