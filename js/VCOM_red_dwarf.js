Although a typical <i>red dwarf</i> is small by star standards, it's still bigger than Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.</p><p class="long">Red dwarfs are the most common kinds of stars in the Milky Way, but they are so relatively dim and small that they can't be seen without a telescope. The star that's closest to our sun is a red dwarf called Proxima Centauri. In astronomy, cooler stars are described as <i>red</i>, and hotter stars are considered <i>blue</i>. The term <i>red dwarf</i> was first used around 1915.</p></div></div>`;
