The result of the red scare was that people became afraid of being associated with communists or labeled communists themselves. Those who were considered communist sympathizers often found themselves blacklisted, or placed on a list that blocked them from getting jobs. The term <i>red scare</i> comes from the historic connection of the color <i>red</i> with communism.</p></div>`;
