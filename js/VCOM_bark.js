Seals also <i>bark</i>, and people sometimes <i>bark</i> with laughter or <i>bark</i> out commands.</p><p class="long"><i>Bark</i> is both a noun and a verb: if your dog is known for his noisy bark, it means that he barks all the time. There is also the type of bark that covers the trunk of a tree, and yet another bark, an old-fashioned word for a masted ship. When you "<i>bark</i> up the wrong tree," you have completely misunderstood a situation, the way a squirrel-chasing dog does when she literally barks in the wrong direction.</p></div></div>`;
