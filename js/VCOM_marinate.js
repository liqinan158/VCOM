You might <i>marinate</i> fish in soy sauce before putting it on the grill.</p><p class="long">The liquid used to marinate meat, fish, or vegetables is called a "marinade," and it usually includes some acidic ingredient like lemon juice or vinegar that helps the flavors penetrate the food. When you marinate chicken or tofu or beef, it becomes more moist and delicious after you cook it. The French root, <i>mariner</i>, means "to pickle in sea brine."</p></div></div>`;
