The <i>lute</i> appears in many of Shakespeare's plays. You might also see a <i>lute</i> player at a Renaissance Faire.</p><p class="long">The wooden body of a lute is very round, while the front is flat with strings extending up the long neck to frets, like a ukulele or a guitar. Lute players are called <i>luthiers</i>, and they play mainly by plucking the strings, rather than strumming them. The word <i>lute</i> comes from the Old Proven√ßal <i>laut</i>, from the Arabic root <i>al-'ud</i>, "the wood."</p></div></div>`;
