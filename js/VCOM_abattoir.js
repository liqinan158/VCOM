It's not a word you're likely to hear or use unless you're involved in these activities.</p><p class="long">However, break <i>abattoir</i> into its component parts, <i>abate</i> + <i>-ory,</i> and things get a lot more interesting. <i>-Ory</i> is simple: it means "a place for," as in  <i>factory</i>, <i>laboratory</i>, and even <i>auditorium</i>. <i>Abate</i> is more complex. Today it means "to lessen," but back when it came to English via the Old French <i>abattre,</i> it meant "to beat down," a meaning Old French had inherited from the Latin <i>ad</i> ("to") + <i>battere</i> ("beat"). So when you think of <i>abattoir</i>, you can think of the idea of "a beating," or an animal's life "abating" until it is gone.</p></div></div>`;
