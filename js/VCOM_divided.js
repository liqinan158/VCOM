A <i>divided</i> political party might be separated into several groups with very different opinions on what the party's priorities ought to be.</p><p class="long">Things can be physically divided, the way a pizza is when it's cut into eight separate pieces, or the way a highway is when it has a concrete barrier between lanes that go in different directions. There's also a figurative way of being divided, like a divided family that's feuding about something, or divided experts who disagree on the findings of a study. The adjective <i>divided</i> comes from the Latin <i>dividere</i>, "to force apart, cleave, or distribute."</p></div></div>`;
