Which is kind of depressing.</p><p class="long">From the Old English <i>cnyll</i>, meaning “sound made by a bell when struck or rung slowly,” comes our modern day <i>knell</i>. It certainly describes the slow, ominous sound of funeral bells, but isn't always used so literally: We often say that a final blow or action that will bring an end to something sounds or signals the death knell. And if you hear a bell knell in your dreams, look out — superstition says that's not a good sign.</p></div>`;
