If you've read a novel <i>previously</i>, you might just skim it before your book group meets to discuss it.</p><p class="long">When you talk about things that happened before, whether recently or in the distant past, the word <i>previously</i> can be helpful. You could mention at a job interview that before your current job, you were previously employed as a flight attendant, or tell a date that though you're single now, you were previously married to a famous movie star. <i>Previously</i> comes from the adjective <i>previous</i>, with its Latin root <i>praevius</i>, "going before," from <i>prae</i>, "before," and <i>via</i>, "road."</p></div>`;
