If your pet wolf keeps up his <i>continual</i> howling all night, your neighbors will let you know about it.</p><p class="long">Something continual doesn't seem to stop. Your continual nightmares about terrifying clowns occur night after night, and the continual interruptions of your adorable nephew while you're talking on the phone will probably seem less and less cute the longer they continue. The Latin root word is <i>continuus</i>, "uninterrupted," and if you're truly talking about something going on without pause, you'll want to use the word <i>continuous</i> instead.</p></div>`;
