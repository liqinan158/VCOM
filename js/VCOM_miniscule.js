That’s why it’s in the word <i>miniscule</i> too, right? Wrong. It’s there because enough people spelled the word incorrectly that dictionary editors have given in. The traditional spelling is <i>minuscule</i>, with a <i>u</i> instead of a second <i>i</i>; <i>minuscule</i> is derived from the Latin word minus meaning “less.” Sticklers are surely convinced that the newfangled spelling illustrates the miniscule amount of respect that English speakers have for their own language.</p></div></div>`;
