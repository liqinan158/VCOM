For example, without <i>self-control</i>, you might burp and curse nonstop.</p><p class="long">Have you ever had a potato chip or two and pretty soon youâ€™ve eaten the whole bag? Eating a whole bag of chips shows little self-control. Not charging an expensive thing you want to a credit card takes self-control. Getting up early for work takes self-control. Without self-control, it's hard to get far in life. Self-control is similar to self-discipline.</p></div>`;
