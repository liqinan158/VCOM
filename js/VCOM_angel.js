The word suggests goodness, and is often used to refer to someone who offers comfort and aid to others in times of trouble.  As a child, you looked like an innocent <i>angel</i>; appearances can be deceiving.</p><p class="long">The word <i>angel</i> derives from the Greek <i>angelos</i>, meaning "messenger." It is used in the Bible to denote God's attendants, with angels often depicted as being guardians of humans, an idea found in ancient Asian cultures as well. The Biblical sense was continued in a medieval gold coin called an angel, which depicted the archangel Michael. The word has been applied to angel fish, so named because they appear to have wings, and nurses, often called "angels of mercy."</p></div>`;
