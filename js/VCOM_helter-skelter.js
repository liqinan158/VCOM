Your <i>helter-skelter</i> housekeeping style will definitely not impress your tidy grandmother when she comes to visit.</p><p class="long">You can use <i>helter-skelter</i> as an adjective, to describe something disorderly, or an adverb for things that are done haphazardly: "The little car, packed full of clowns, took off <i>helter-skelter</i> down the street." This word has been around since the 16th century, from the Middle English <i>skelte</i>, "to scatter hurriedly." The Beatles made it famous when they named a song "Helter Skelter" on the 1968 record popularly called "The White Album."</p></div>`;
