It's never pretty, so try to keep your dignity, and don't <i>snivel</i>!</p><p class="long">If you want a real picture of the verb <i>snivel</i>, consider that the meaning of the assumed Old English word <i>snyflan</i> meant "to run at the nose, to sniffle." Even worse, that was derived from <i>snofl</i>, or "mucus." Pretty picture, eh? The word came to mean "be tearful," and it suggested someone who was weak or nasty. Today it is often used in its adjective form, <i>sniveling</i>, followed by a contemptuous noun like "coward."</p></div></div>`;
