Two things that rub up against each other also grind together, which is what your teeth do if you grind them in your sleep. Informally, <i>grind</i> also means boring, tedious work, often in the sense of "<i>grind</i> away" or "the daily <i>grind</i>." This sense of <i>grind</i> was invented in the 1800s as college slang.</p></div>`;
