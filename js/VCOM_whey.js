Rather than being thrown away, <i>whey</i> is often used to add buttery flavor or extra protein to processed foods.</p><p class="long">You may know the word <i>whey</i> from the nursery rhyme that begins "Little Miss Muffet sat on her tuffet eating her curds and whey..." Curds and whey are part of the cheese-making process, with whey being the slightly sour leftover liquid. Think buttermilk or thin yogurt, and you've got an idea of what whey tastes like. It's actually a great source of protein and often shows up in healthy smoothies and shakes.</p></div></div>`;
