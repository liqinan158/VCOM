Whether it's a brick wall or a difficult reading passage, something <i>impenetrable</i> won't let you in.</p><p class="long"><i>Impenetrable</i> comes from the Latin <i>impenetrabilis</i>, meaning "not to put or get into, enter into." <i>Impenetrable</i>, the adjective, has two meanings. When you're trying to learn a subject that is so complicated, so confusing or so detailed that it seems like it's in another language or from another planet, it's <i>impenetrable</i> â€” like calculus. Or a physical object can be <i>impenetrable</i>, meaning it is impossible to actually enter or get inside of, like that <i>impenetrable</i> nightclub that has bouncers watching every entrance to keep you and your friends out.</p></div></div>`;
