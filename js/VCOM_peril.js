The word <i>peril</i> means imminent danger to life and limb.</p><p class="long"><i>Peril</i> comes from the Latin <i>peric(u)lum</i>, meaning danger. Today it's often used in tandem with the word <i>mortal</i>, which relates to death. For example, you're in mortal peril when you're flying down a cliff-side trail on your mountain bike and you hit loose gravel. <i>Peril</i> can also describe dangers of a less physical sort, though it's less common. If your employer sinks your 401K into what turns out to be a Ponzi scheme, he's put your retirement in peril.</p></div></div>`;
