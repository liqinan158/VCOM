The <i>displeasure</i> on your mom's face will clearly show you how she feels about you letting your pet guinea pigs sleep in her bed.</p><p class="long">Use the word <i>displeasure</i> when you are irritated by something or sternly disapprove of it.

One way for citizens to express their displeasure with elected officials is to vote against them â€” another might be staging a protest.</p></div>`;
