You could be a <i>seamstress</i> if you hem your own pants, but most <i>seamstresses</i> work in factories sewing garments using sewing machines.</p><p class="long">Traditionally, a seamstress was a woman who sewed seams in clothes using a machine, or occasionally by hand. Seamstresses weren't considered as skilled as a dressmaker, who makes custom clothing, or a tailor, who alters clothes to fit a specific person. Each of these titles is a distinct job, but they are commonly used interchangeably. Some people use the newer, unisex term <i>sewist</i> instead of <i>seamstress</i>.</p></div></div>`;
