While you can use the phrase for any pregnant mammal, it's most commonly used to talk about human fetuses and things that affect their development. For example, a fetus's kicks might be described by a doctor as "<i>in utero</i> movement," or she may be concerned about in utero exposure to cigarette smoke.</p></div>`;
