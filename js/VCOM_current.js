Things that are <i>current</i> are happening now; they are part of the present time. News reporting looks at "current affairs" because past affairs are no longer news; they are history. Expressions like "staying current" or "keeping up with current events" show a need or desire to know what's popular, important, or relevant <i>now</i>. As a noun, a <i>current</i> can be a flow of water, electricity, or ideas.</p></div>`;
