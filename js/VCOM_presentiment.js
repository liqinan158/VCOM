That’s called a <i>presentiment</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>presentiment</i> comes from the Latin word <i>præsentire</i>, meaning “to sense beforehand.” Some people call it a "gut feeling." For example, if you leave for a trip and something doesn't feel right, you may chalk it up to just being nervous. But later, when your flight is cancelled and you lose your luggage, you may remember that little twinge — the presentiment that something bad was about to happen.</p></div></div>`;
