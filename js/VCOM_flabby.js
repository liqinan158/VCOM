Some people join a gym when they're feeling a little <i>flabby</i>.</p><p class="long">People who are flabby aren't star athletes â€” you may be flabby after a long, cold winter spent mostly indoors, or feel flabby as you struggle to hike up a mountain. You can describe other things as figuratively flabby too, if they're a little sloppy or weak. Flabby writing is messy and disorganized, and a flabby politician is ineffective. <i>Flabby</i> started as <i>flappy</i>, "softly fleshy," in the 16th century.</p></div>`;
