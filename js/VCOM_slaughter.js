When cattle are old enough, they're sent to <i>slaughter</i> and their meat is processed and shipped to stores.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>slaughter</i> was first used in the 1300s and comes from the Old Norse word <i>slahtr</i>, which also described the mass killing of animals or people. A verb form came along later, in the 1530s. You might hear <i>slaughter</i> used to describe the killing of large numbers of people in a war, a genocide, or a massacre. It also can be used figuratively to describe a crushing defeat, like the slaughter of your basketball team by your bitter rivals.</p></div>`;
