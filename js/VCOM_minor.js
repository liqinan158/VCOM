Likewise, the star constellation Ursa Major is a larger grouping than Ursa <i>Minor</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>minor</i> has retained its spelling from the Latin. There, <i>minor</i> means something "lesser," and is related to the Latin word <i>minuere</i>, which means "to diminish." It is usually used as an adjective, but as a noun it gained the meaning "underage" in the 16th Century, and is now used to refer to children and teens under the age of legal responsibility. It is also used in musical terms to refer to a key that has a flatted third in its scale.</p></div>`;
