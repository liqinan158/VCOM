Some people evacuate their homes during a big hurricane, while others <i>hunker down</i> and wait for the storm to pass.</p><p class="long">This term is such a popular way to describe taking shelter from a storm that it's become a weather report cliché. You might hunker down in your basement during a tornado watch, but you can also hunker down during an argument, refusing to budge from your stated position. <i>Hunker</i> comes from Scottish — it means "crouch on your heels" or "squat." Sometimes the phrase is also used to mean "get to work," like when you hunker down and finish your homework.</p></div></div>`;
