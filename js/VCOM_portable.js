You may carry your <i>portable</i> computer with you from class to class because it's small, light, and fits easily in your backpack.</p><p class="long">First appearing around 1400, <i>portable</i> stems from the Latin word <i>portare</i>, meaning "to carry." Used as an adjective, <i>portable</i> describes something you can carry around easily. Used as a noun, it means a smaller, easy-to-carry version of something, like a computer or television. On a trip, you might take your portable so you can watch movies in the car. Before computers became popular, you might have carried around a lightweight typewriter called a portable.</p></div></div>`;
