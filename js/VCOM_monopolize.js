When you were little, your mom might have said, "Don't <i>monopolize</i> the swing. Let your sister have a turn."</p><p class="long">When a company monopolizes something, it has an unfair amount of control over a particular product or service, hurting other companies and giving consumers fewer choices. A business might monopolize the media in an entire state, for example, by owning the local newspapers, TV stations, and news websites. <i>Monopolize</i> comes from <i>monopoly</i>, which isn't just a great board game, but actually means "exclusive control of a commodity or trade."</p></div></div>`;
