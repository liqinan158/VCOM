Besides the literal meaning, it’s a common word for a jerk or idiot.</p><p class="long">If you call someone an <i>asshole</i>, they're probably doing something not just stupid and annoying, but mean. Like all slang words and obscenities, this is a word you need to be careful about using. Saying <i>asshole</i> in class, in a paper, at a job interview, or even on television could get you in serious trouble. If you’re not alone with your buddies, stick to a safer word like <i>jerk</i> or <i>doofus</i>.</p></div></div>`;
