It's probably <i>puffery</i> if your sister tells you you're the most attractive, smartest, kindest person she knows â€” right before asking you to loan her 50 dollars.</p><p class="long">If you exaggerate compliments in order to get something in return, you've engaged in puffery. In addition to this common usage, <i>puffery</i> is also an actual legal term meaning "an exaggeration or statement that no reasonable person would take as factual." So if a furniture company claims in a TV ad that one night's sleep on their mattresses will raise your IQ by 20 points, you can be pretty sure it's puffery.</p></div>`;
