According to <i>folklore</i>, you shouldn't take rocks from the volcanoes in Hawaii because Pele, the volcano goddess, will be angry and curse you.</p><p class="long"><i>Folklore</i> is a combination of the words <i>folk</i> and <i>lore</i> which dates from 1846. The former refers to a community of people, and the latter comes from the Old English <i>lar</i>, meaning learning or knowledge. <i>Folk</i>, in this sense, is also used in terms like <i>folk music, folk dance</i>, and <i>folktale</i>. Although traditionally folklore is passed along by word of mouth, in the modern era much folklore is being collected on the Internet.</p></div>`;
