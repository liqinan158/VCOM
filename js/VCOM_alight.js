That period’s word <i>ālīhtan</i> had an original meaning of dismounting, or lightening the load on the horse, and so is the ancestor of the verb we use today that means "to settle or perch."  Meanwhile, the word <i>onlīhtan</i> (see the different spelling?) of that same time meant to be on fire, which became our adjectival use of the word.</p></div></div>`;
