Some <i>urns</i> are used for making coffee or tea, others are made to put someone’s ashes in. Go figure.</p><p class="long"><i>Urn</i> is probably from the Latin word <i>urna</i> for "a jar or vessel," but some say it’s from another Latin word <i>urere</i> which means, "to burn.”  While some urns are used for making hot drinks, the most common use of an urn is holding the ashes of a dead person. Most urns are decorated. “Ode to a Grecian Urn” by the Romantic poet John Keats (1820), is a poem about the figures on a classical Greek urn.</p></div>`;
