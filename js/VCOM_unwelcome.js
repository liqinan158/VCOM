Things can also be unwelcome, like bad news or heckling from the audience during your stand-up comedy routine. Anything you don't wish for and don't appreciate can be described as unwelcome. <i>Welcome</i> has its roots in the Old English <i>wilcuma</i>, a friendly greeting and earlier "a welcome guest," from <i>willa</i>, "pleasure or choice," and <i>cuma</i>, "guest."</p></div></div>`;
