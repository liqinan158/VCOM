If you want to become a <i>juggler</i>, try juggling tennis balls instead of fiery torches.</p><p class="long">Watching a juggler perform can be awe-inspiring, especially if she's juggling knives or some other dangerous set of objects. You can become a juggler simply by learning to juggle, and professional jugglers can work for circuses or perform for money at festivals and street fairs. <i>Juggler</i>, <i>jester</i>, and <i>wizard</i> all once shared a meaning as well as a root, the Old English <i>geogelere</i>, "magician or conjurer."</p></div></div>`;
