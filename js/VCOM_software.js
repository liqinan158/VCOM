Some experts suggest the actual word was coined in 1953 as a joke by Paul Niquette. He used the word to refer to the programs for a computer â€” as opposed to the <i>hardware</i> that made up the physical computer. You can purchase software, install software, and even fix software bugs.</p></div>`;
