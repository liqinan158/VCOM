To inform someone is to provide them with information â€” to educate or advise them about something. <i>Inform</i> comes from a Latin root, <i>informare</i>, "train or instruct," and literally "shape or form." Adding the "wrong" or "not" prefix <i>mis-</i> gives you <i>misinform</i>, "to instruct in the wrong way."</p></div></div>`;
