Without a <i>boarding pass</i>, you can't get aboard.</p><p class="long">If you've ever flown on a plane, you're probably familiar with boarding passes. A boarding pass is something you either print at home or get at the airport. It's a ticket that specifically allows you entrance to the airplane (or if you're traveling by sea, a boat). If you lose your boarding pass, you won't be allowed to board. Boarding passes allow the airline to make sure the people on the plane all bought tickets and belong there.</p></div>`;
