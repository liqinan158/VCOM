Your grandfather might keep his important papers in a <i>coffer</i> in his study.</p><p class="long">You can keep your heirlooms, jewels, and savings bonds in a coffer, a safe chest for tucking such things safely away. <i>Coffer</i> takes on a figurative meaning when you talk about the coffers of a large institution: "There's plenty of money in the government coffers â€” they just don't want to spend it on education!" Yet another meaning of the word is "decorative sunken panel in a ceiling," such as one you'd see in a mosque, museum, or cathedral ceiling.</p></div>`;
