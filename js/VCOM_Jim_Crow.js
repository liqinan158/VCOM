Even though these laws were enacted between 1876 and 1965, the effects of <i>Jim Crow</i> are relevant today.</p><p class="long">Originally, Jim Crow was the name of a character in a plantation song in the American south. From there, it became associated with discrimination against African-Americans after slavery. Jim Crow laws made it difficult for African-Americans to vote. Forcing African-Americans to use separate restaurants and bathrooms was another example of Jim Crow. This name is synonymous with bigotry and racism. Even today, when there is racism against African-Americans, people will refer to Jim Crow.</p></div>`;
