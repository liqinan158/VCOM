The platform they're standing on is called a <i>rostrum</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Rostrum</i>, originally "animal snout or bird's beak" in Latin, has a back-and-forth history. The word came to be used for the battering beak at a warshipâ€™s bow. The ancient Romans used beaks from captured ships to decorate a platform from which orators could speak, called the <i>rostra</i>, the plural of <i>rostrum</i>. In the mid-17th century, <i>rostrum</i> came to mean a platform for speeches, performances, or receiving awards. By the way, the plural of <i>rostrum</i> is still <i>rostra</i>.</p></div>`;
