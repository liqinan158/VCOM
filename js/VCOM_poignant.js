Watching a <i>poignant</i> YouTube video about baby penguins chasing their mothers, for example, might give you a lump in your throat.</p><p class="long"><i>Poignant</i> comes from the Latin <i>pungere</i> "to prick," the same root as <i>pungent</i>. But something that's <i>pungent</i> pricks your sense of smell, whereas <i>poignant</i> refers to something that pricks your emotions, especially in a melancholy way. Movie critics might describe a touching portrayal as <i>poignant</i> if there isn't a dry eye in the house.</p></div>`;
