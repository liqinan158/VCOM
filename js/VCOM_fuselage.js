Your luggage rides in the <i>fuselage</i> too.</p><p class="long">The word <i>fuselage</i> comes from the Latin <i>fusus</i>, or "spindle," which describes the shape of the central tube-shaped part of an airplane. Wings, tails, engines — these are all extra parts of the plane that attach to the fuselage. Different kinds of airplanes have different types of fuselages, depending on how fast they need to travel and what they carry, but a fuselage is always hollow and always has a cockpit at the front.</p></div>`;
