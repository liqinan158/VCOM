What happened? The invention of bling for one thing, and the rise of a culture that celebrates material pleasures. Today, <i>luxurious</i> translates as exclusive, comfortable, expensive and superior in quality, like a <i>luxurious</i> home featured in a magazine about rich people and their favorite things.</p></div></div>`;
