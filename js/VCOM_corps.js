This word can also refer to other groups of people, like a press <i>corps</i>, which is a gang of journalists trying to get the scoop.</p><p class="long">Although the word <i>corps</i> comes from the Latin <i>corpus</i>, for “body,” don’t pronounce the <i>p</i> or you’re talking about the kind of body that goes in a coffin. The main meaning of a corps (which is singular despite the <i>s</i>) is a unit of the army. The word applies to other groups, too. A law firm has a corps of lawyers, a doctor has a corps of nurses, and a tiny car could have a corps of clowns.</p></div>`;
