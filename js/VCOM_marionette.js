You might see a <i>marionette</i> show at a child's birthday party.</p><p class="long">A marionette is a very specific kind of puppet, one that's operated with sticks and wires or strings that move its arms, legs, and head in a nearly lifelike way. Marionettes have been around for centuries, at least since the ancient Greeks used them around 500 BC. The word <i>marionette</i> means "little little Mary" in French, a reference to one of the earliest known marionette characters, a puppet version of the Virgin Mary.</p></div>`;
