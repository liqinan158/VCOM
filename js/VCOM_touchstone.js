For example, a filmmaker's <i>touchstone</i> might be her all-time favorite movie; she wants her movie to be that good or similar to it in some way.</p><p class="long"><i>Touchstone</i> as it is defined today comes from an actual stone. In the late 15th century, gold and silver was rubbed, or touched against black quartz — the touchstone — to determine the purity of the metals. This was done by looking at the color of the streaks left on the stone. This is why a touchstone, in the figurative sense as it is used today, is a measuring tool.</p></div></div>`;
