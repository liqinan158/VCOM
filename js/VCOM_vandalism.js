Some people think of graffiti as public art, while others dismiss it as nothing but <i>vandalism</i>.</p><p class="long">If you damage public or private property on purpose, you've committed the crime of vandalism. The range of vandalism can vary from carving your initials in a desk at school to tearing pages out of a library book to breaking windows of a building. The word <i>vandal</i> comes from the <i>Vandals</i>, the Germanic tribe that attacked Rome in 455. The tribe's name meant "wanderer," but the word <i>vandal</i> was used in the 1600s to mean "destroyer of what is beautiful."</p></div></div>`;
