If you <i>suggest</i> going out for ice cream, nobody's going to object. If you <i>suggest</i> that your sister should get the frozen yogurt instead, she might think you are <i>suggesting</i> something about her weight.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>suggest</i> is also used when people speak about scientific research. Experimental results are often used to suggest whether a theory might be correct. For example, if a patient takes a new drug and starts feeling better, that will suggest the drug is working. <i>Suggest</i> can also mean to drop a hint. If you find a polite way to suggest that the pot roast is inedible, you don't come out and declare it directly. You wouldn't want to hurt Mom's feelings.</p></div></div>`;
