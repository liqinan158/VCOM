If someone makes a <i>ribald</i> joke in class, she will probably be sent to the principal's office.</p><p class="long">The word <i>ribald</i> can be used to describe a joke, a movie, or even a person, like a <i>ribald</i> comedian on a late-night talk show. Ribald humor is generally considered to be inappropriate around children, and if you make a ribald comment, you might inadvertently offend someone. This word derives from an Old French word meaning "rogue" or "debauched."</p></div>`;
