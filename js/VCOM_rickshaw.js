People sit in it and an energetic person pedals or pulls them to where they want to go. <i>Rickshaws</i> are still around, but cars have made them less popular.</p><p class="long">A rickshaw is a like a taxi — you pay its driver for a ride — but rickshaws are typically only large enough for one or two passengers. The earliest Japanese rickshaws were lifted and pulled by a person who walked or ran. Newer versions are pulled by a bike or driven like a car — these are sometimes called "auto <i>rickshaws</i>." The word itself comes from the Japanese <i>jinrikisha</i>, from <i>jin</i>, "man," <i>riki</i>, "power," and <i>sha</i>, "carriage."</p></div>`;
