With a <i>collaborative</i> effort, a big job can be completed in very little time.</p><p class="long">When you collaborate, you cooperate, or join forces, with other people â€” working on a project, brainstorming ideas, even assigning responsibility for who will do what. So something that has these qualities is collaborative. From playing in a band to making a movie, feeding the students at a school to building a house, when you work toward a shared goal, it's collaborative.</p></div>`;
