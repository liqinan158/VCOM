That taxi driver who charged your Aunt Fay $75 for the ride from the airport was taking advantage of her <i>naivety</i> — your aunt didn’t know it should only cost $50.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>naivety</i> often refers to the kind of inexperience that allows you to be tricked, but it can also refer to a trusting innocent or a lack of sophistication. For example, if you think you can treat your boss’s daughter like any other employee and just say whatever you want when you have lunch, you may be exhibiting naivety — she may tell your boss what you said.</p></div></div>`;
