A fairy tale frog transmogrifies into a prince in one well-known story, and a tomboy might be said to transmogrify when she puts on a frilly dress to be a flower girl in a wedding. The origin of <i>transmogrify</i> isn't clear, although one theory is that it was a mistake made long ago, when someone meant to say <i>transmigrate</i>, or "pass into another body after death."</p></div></div>`;
