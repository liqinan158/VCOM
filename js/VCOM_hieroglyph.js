Several ancient cultures, including Egyptians and Mayans, used <i>hieroglyphs</i> as part of their writing systems.</p><p class="long">The earliest hieroglyphs archaeologists have found were carved in stone around 3000 BCE, in Egypt. These symbols and pictures were clearly not just illustrations, but part of a true written language . Each hieroglyph stood for an object or action, represented the sound of a syllable, and made the meaning of surrounding hieroglyphs clear. The Greek roots of this word are <i>hieros</i>,  "sacred," and <i>glyphe</i>, "carving."</p></div>`;
