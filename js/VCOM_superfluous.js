Use it when pointing out something that could be removed without detracting from the quality of something: "For a climb over a glacier, the very thickest shoes are absolutely necessary; beyond these, all else seems superfluous to me," wrote the adventurer Charles Stoddard in 1899. The word comes from Latin and literally means "overflowing": <i>super</i> ("over") + <i>fluere</i> ("to flow"). So you can think of a superfluous addition as flowing over the boundaries of what's needed.</p></div>`;
