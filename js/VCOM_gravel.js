Your <i>gravel</i> driveway might crunch under your boots as you walk to the mailbox.</p><p class="long">Roads, paths, walkways, and yards are all sometimes paved with gravel, which is a relatively inexpensive material to use for marking areas and preventing the growth of weeds and other plants. Gravel is more rough and rocky than sand, and smaller than stones. The word <i>gravel</i> comes from the French word <i>gravele</i>, "gravel or sand," which in turn comes from <i>grave</i>, "seashore or sand." The ultimate Proto-Indo-European root may be <i>ghreu</i>, "to rub or grind."</p></div></div>`;
