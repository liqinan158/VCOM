Halloween is partly about dressing up in costumes, but mostly it's about the <i>candy</i>.</p><p class="long">Your favorite candy may be sweet and fruity, or so sour you can barely stand to eat it. Other people prefer chocolate when it comes to candy. <i>Candy</i> is also a verb, meaning "coat with a sugary glaze," â€” you might candy cherries or almonds. And when something's made of candy, the word becomes an adjective: "But it's only a <i>candy</i> cigarette!" The word comes from the Arabic <i>qandi</i>, with its Persian root <i>quand</i>, "cane sugar."</p></div>`;
