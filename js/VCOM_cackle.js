var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">cackle</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>cackle</i> is to laugh in a loud, harsh way. Your dad's jokes might be so bad that they're funny, making you <i>cackle</i> every time.</p><p class="long">When you cackle, people hear you â€” it's annoying to sit in an otherwise quiet restaurant beside a table of people who talk and cackle raucously. The sound the cacklers make can also be called a <i>cackle</i>, a squawking laugh that a chicken might make. Experts think there may be a connection between <i>cackle</i> and the Middle Dutch word for "jaw," <i>kake</i>, but it's most likely to be imitative, a word that sounds just like the noise it describes.</p></div>`;
