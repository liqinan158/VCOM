A person who feels <i>alienated</i> may not actually be from another place (or planet), but he sure feels that way. You may feel <i>alienated</i> from your friends if they have all decided that punk rock is the greatest thing on earth, but you are still loyal to the classic rock that you all used to love.</p></div></div>`;
