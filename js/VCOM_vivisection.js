The word is usually used by people who oppose the practice.</p><p class="long">You can see how the word would be an inflammatory way of describing experimentation on animals, as the root <i>vivi-</i>, meaning "alive," makes the practice sound all the more gruesome. Surgery on a (living) person would not be called <i>vivisection</i>. You can also use the word <i>vivisection</i> metaphorically, as you might write a review of a rap concert and perform a ruthless <i>vivisection</i> of the artist's rendition of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow."</p></div>`;
