var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">unnerved</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To be <i>unnerved</i> is to lose courage or become uneasy. You might think you want to try bungee jumping, only to feel <i>unnerved</i> once you're standing on the edge of a bridge preparing to jump.</p><p class="long">The word <i>nerve</i> can mean  "strength, steadiness, and courage," as in "I planned to confront him, but then I lost my nerve."  It makes sense, then, that being <i>unnerved</i> means a loss of that same steadfastness or bravery. So you might be unnerved on airplanes or when confronted with spiders, depending on what makes you feel a little less than brave.</p></div></div>`;
