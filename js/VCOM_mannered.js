It means that the way you act seems artificial or exaggerated. Chill out.</p><p class="long"><i>Manners</i> are the way we behave in society, how we speak and act with other people. Use <i>mannered</i> to say that someone has exaggerated or unnatural manners. In combination with other words — as in <i>well-mannered</i> or <i>mild-mannered</i> — <i>mannered</i> can take a positive meaning, but when it's used by itself, it's a criticism. Your pretentious classmate is mannered, and an actor's stilted, phony performance is also mannered.</p></div></div>`;
