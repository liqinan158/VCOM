If nothing you do stops your dog from barking, you're <i>powerless</i> to make her be quiet.</p><p class="long">A person who doesn't have the power they need to accomplish something can be described as powerless. A flustered substitute teacher is powerless to silence a chattering classroom, and citizens who don't vote are powerless to change their elected representatives in Congress. <i>Power</i>, "strength or vigor," can be traced back to a root meaning "power" or "lord." When you add the suffix <i>-less</i>, or "lacking," you get <i>powerless</i>.</p></div>`;
