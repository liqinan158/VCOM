They all go back to the Latin verb <i>consentire</i>, meaning "to agree" or literally, "to feel together," from the combination of <i>sentire</i> and <i>com</i>. In modern English, <i>consensual</i> is often used when discussing sex, particularly whether the act was consensual, agreed on by both people, or non-consensual, if one person was unwilling or too young to legally give consent.</p></div>`;
