A <i>graceless</i> dancer steps on toes, and a <i>graceless</i> winner rubs it in.</p><p class="long">People can be graceless in their physical movements or actions, like a graceless ballet dancer who thumps heavily across the stage. Or they can be graceless in their words or behavior, like a graceless stand-up comic who isn't funny, just rude and boorish. <i>Graceless</i> originally meant "not in a state of grace," with <i>grace</i> defined as "God's love." A more modern meaning of <i>grace</i> is "beauty of form or movement."</p></div></div>`;
