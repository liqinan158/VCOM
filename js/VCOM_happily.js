It can lift your spirits just to hear your friend whistling <i>happily</i> as she walks down the sidewalk with a smile on her face.</p><p class="long">If you're happy to do something, you'll do it happily. Most of us will happily finish that last piece of cake or happily cuddle a tiny puppy. A second meaning of this adverb is "fortunately," so you could say, "Happily, I shut the front door before your cat got out!" This definition dates from the late 14th century â€” earlier, people used <i>happily</i> to mean "accidentally." And of course the very happiest stories end with "they lived happily ever after."</p></div>`;
