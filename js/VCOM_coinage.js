A numismatist — that's the technical term for a coin collector — is interested in <i>coinage</i>. <i>Coinage</i> is also the process of coming up with a new word.</p><p class="long">You probably wouldn't refer to the dimes jingling in your pocket as coinage, since this term tends to be used for coins in a more collective way, as in the coinage of foreign countries. Another way to use <i>coinage</i> is for the process of inventing (or <i>coining</i>) a new word. Shakespeare is famous for a lot of literary achievements, including his coinage of words like "lackluster," "bandit," and "bedazzled."</p></div>`;
