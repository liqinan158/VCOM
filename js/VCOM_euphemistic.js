A <i>euphemistic</i> way to say "pregnant," for example, is "in the family way."</p><p class="long">People often use euphemistic expressions when they're afraid of offending or upsetting someone. You might refer to pornography as "adult material," or instead of saying, "You're going bald," say "You're looking a little thin on top." <i>Euphemism</i> comes from the Greek <i>euphemismos</i>, "use of a favorable word in place of an inauspicious one," from the roots <i>eu-</i>, "good," and <i>pheme</i>, "speaking."</p></div></div>`;
