Many <i>square dances</i> feature live music.</p><p class="long">A square dance is a type of folk dance that's named for the fact that dancers stand in a square, rather than in a long line (as in a contra dance). Groups of four couples move through a series of basic square dancing steps that are narrated by a caller, whose job it is to direct the dancers' movements. Traditionally, square dance music features accordion, banjo, and fiddle.</p></div>`;
