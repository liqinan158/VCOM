That <i>dizziness</i> you feel right after riding on the merry-go-round is totally normal.</p><p class="long">Dizziness isn't necessarily bad â€” in fact, little kids often deliberately spin in circles just so they can experience the giddy, reeling dizziness that results. However, if you've got a bad head cold or an inner ear disorder, the accompanying dizziness can be scary or nauseating. Sometimes this word is also used to mean "silliness," as in the dizziness you feel when someone you have a crush on gives you a special smile.</p></div>`;
