Give the bottle a shake and those layers combine in a process called <i>emulsion</i> or the combination of liquids that don't dissolve into each other.</p><p class="long"><i>Emulsion</i> comes from the Latin <i>mulgere</i> meaning to "milk out." Seems strange, doesn't it? But in the early seventeenth century, the term was used to describe the milky liquid that result from crushing almonds in water. Think of natural peanut butter and how it separates with a thick layer of oil on top. When you stir it with a long spoon, that's the process of emulsion, or a combination of two liquids that don't dissolve into each other.</p></div>`;
