Mathematicians use the word <i>axiom</i> to refer to an established proof.</p><p class="long">The word <i>axiom</i> comes from a Greek word meaning “worthy.” An axiom is a worthy, established fact. For philosophers, an axiom is a statement like “something can’t be true and not be true at the same time.” An example of a mathematical axiom is “a number is equal to itself.” In everyday usage, an axiom is just a common saying, but it’s one that pretty much everyone agrees on.</p></div>`;
