This definition dates from the fifteenth century, literally meaning "able to be passed" or "able to be crossed." A later meaning of <i>passable</i> is "acceptable." You can use this word to describe things that aren't wonderful, but are good enough: "It's not the moistest cake I've ever tasted, but it's <i>passable</i>."</p></div>`;
