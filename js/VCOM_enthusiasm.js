The word <i>enthusiasm</i> indicates intense excitement.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>enthusiasm</i> comes from the Greek word <i>enthousiasmos</i>, from <i>enthous</i>, meaning “possessed by a god, inspired.” It was originally used in a derogatory sense to describe excessive religious zeal. Today both the religious and derogatory connotations are gone from <i>enthusiasm</i>, but the zeal has survived. Use it to describe great excitement or interest, like what you feel when you’re doing something that you really, really enjoy.</p></div></div>`;
