A good night's sleep will revitalize you â€” so will eating a healthy meal. If a rundown building is purchased and then spiffed up, it's being revitalized. A new paint job could revitalize a room. A sick person is revitalized by medicine. In all cases, when something is revitalized, it has been restored to a better state.</p></div>`;
