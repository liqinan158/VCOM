var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">equable</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The adjective <i>equable</i> means "not easily irritated" or "steady," like someone's <i>equable</i> manner that makes everyone instantly feel comfortable.</p><p class="long">To correctly pronounce <i>equable</i>, accent the first syllable: "EK-wah-bul." It comes from the Latin word <i>aequabilis</i>, meaning "equal, consistent, uniform." An equable person isn't moody. You wouldn't expect him or her to fly into a rage one minute and be humming a happy tune the next. Instead, someone who is equable takes things in stride â€” the good, the bad, and the ugly, with a smile and the occasional reminder that "this too shall pass."</p></div>`;
