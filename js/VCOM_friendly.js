You might be new to town, but the people are so <i>friendly</i> that you'll soon feel right at home.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>friend</i> is at the root of the adjective <i>friendly</i>. When you're friendly, you treat everyone like a friend â€” with warmth and respect. A friendly game of badminton is by definition not too serious or competitive, and a vegetarian-friendly menu makes non meat-eaters feel welcome, just as user-friendly instructions make it easy for non-professionals to follow the directions.</p></div></div>`;
