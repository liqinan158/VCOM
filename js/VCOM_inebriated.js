If you see a man staggering down the street grasping a bottle of rum in his hand, chances are he's <i>inebriated</i>.</p><p class="long">When you want to use an impressive word to say that someone is drunk, go ahead and use <i>inebriated</i>. If you like, you can also use it to refer to someone who is intoxicated with substances other than alcohol, but at its heart, <i>inebriated</i> simply means tanked, blotto, stinko, drunk. In more recent years, it has taken on the sense of being particularly energized or zany and exhilarated with drunkenness, but still drunk.</p></div></div>`;
