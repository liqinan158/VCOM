Some candy bars are made by coating <i>toffee</i> in chocolate. Yum!</p><p class="long">Toffee is often confused with another candy with nearly the exact same ingredients, <i>taffy</i>. The difference is mainly in the candy-making process: taffy is pulled and stretched until it's soft and chewy. Toffee, on the other hand, won't stick in your teeth like taffy, because it is boiled, shaped, and allowed to harden into a delicious, glossy slab.</p></div>`;
