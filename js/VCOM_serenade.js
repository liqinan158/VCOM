When you <i>serenade</i> someone, you play or sing a song, often outdoors.</p><p class="long">In Italian, <i>serenata</i> means "an evening song," and the noun <i>serenade</i> is a tune played or sung, either for one specific person or for a larger audience, outside. It's still a serenade if you sing in the daytime, but the classic example of a serenade is a man singing below a woman's window at night. The word <i>serenade</i> can be both a noun — the song itself — and a verb — the act of singing or playing the song.</p></div></div>`;
