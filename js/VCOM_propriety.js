If you are someone who cares about always doing the right and proper thing, your friends might accuse you of being obsessed with <i>propriety</i> and beg you to loosen up.</p><p class="long">In the Victorian Age, both sexes had well-defined roles and were expected to exercise self-restraint.

Their wives at home however, were so confined by the era's standards of <i>propriety</i> that if a woman so much as referred to the fact that she was pregnant, everyone would cover their mouths and gasp. She'd committed an <i>impropriety</i>.</p></div></div>`;
