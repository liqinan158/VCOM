Military, social, and political customs all followed the <i>feudal system</i>, in which land was exchanged for work.</p><p class="long">In a feudal system, a peasant or worker known as a vassal received a piece of land in return for serving a lord or king, especially during times of war. Vassals were expected to perform various duties in exchange for their own fiefs, or areas of land.
