If you hear tiny <i>bleats</i> coming from your barn, you'll know the new baby goats were born at last.</p><p class="long">Many animals might bleat, though a <i>bleat</i> is a slightly weak, high-pitched sound, which is why it's typically made by young animals. When baby animals bleat, their mothers naturally go to them to feed or comfort them. You might also describe a human's cry or whine as a <i>bleat</i>, if it's particularly pitiful. The word comes from a Germanic root, and it's imitative of the sound itself.</p></div>`;
