When molecules move in and out of a cell to achieve the same concentration of something, like salt, on both sides, then <i>osmosis</i> is happening.</p><p class="long"><i>Osmos</i> means "thrusting or pushing," and the scientific process of <i>osmosis</i> happens when fluid in a super-concentrated area thrusts through little holes in the cell's wall and heads for a less concentrated place. The fluid might go back and forth a few times until both solutions are equally concentrated. We also use <i>osmosis</i> outside of science to mean "subtle, gradual absorption of information." Fall asleep to enough Western movies, and by osmosis, you will eventually become a real cowboy.</p></div></div>`;
