Your uncle might hire a <i>decorator</i> to help him furnish his brand new, fancy vacation home.</p><p class="long">You can also call a decorator a designer or an interior designer. Skilled decorators are particularly good at combining colors, fabrics, rugs, and furniture styles to make a good-looking space. Even if you're not a professional decorator, you could offer to help a friend decorate her apartment, painting her walls bright orange and sewing fuzzy green pillows for her sofa. <i>Decorator</i> comes from the Latin word <i>decorare</i>, "to adorn, embellish, or beautify."</p></div>`;
