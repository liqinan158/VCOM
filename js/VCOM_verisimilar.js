If you want to impress your friends, remark on the <i>verisimilar</i> portrait of lost love in that foreign film you all went to see.</p><p class="long"><i>Verisimilar</i> comes from Latin. You’ll notice the word <i>similar</i> at the end, which means “like.” <i>Veri-</i> comes from the word <i>veritas</i>, meaning “truth.” Something that is verisimilar is “like true,” but is not necessarily actually true. A painting of your uncle Marvin, for example, might be so good that it’s <i>verisimilar</i>, in that it almost looks like Uncle Marvin is standing right there — but he isn't.</p></div>`;
