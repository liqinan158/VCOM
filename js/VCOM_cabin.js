Your grandfather's <i>cabin</i> on a lake might be your favorite place to visit in the summer.</p><p class="long">You might dream of living in a cabin deep in the forest, or on the edge of a mountain. Another kind of cabin is a small compartment or room, particularly one on a ship or an airplane. If you have "<i>cabin</i> fever," it means you're restless and cranky after being stuck in a small space for too long. The word comes from a Late Latin root, <i>capanna</i>, "hut."</p></div>`;
