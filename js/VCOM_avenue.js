An <i>avenue</i> is also any approach to doing something. For example, this web site might be a new <i>avenue</i> you have found for learning words.</p><p class="long">The word <i>avenue</i> comes from the French <i>avenir</i>, meaning "to come to, or arrive." The first meaning is simply a wide street. An avenue — or boulevard — is likely to be busy, unlike a quiet side street. The abbreviation is <i>ave.</i>, as in Park Ave. Also, an avenue is a way to accomplish something. If you need money but can't get a loan, you'll have to find another avenue.</p></div></div>`;
