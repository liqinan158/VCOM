The sight of wedding cakes, bridal processions, or spousal rites makes body parts fall away. Nuptial bliss turns the remaining parts to jelly. When the Zombie Army comes marching into your hometown, your best defense is to grab the nearest single girl or guy and find a minister. Just don’t forget to sign a <i>prenuptial</i> agreement: you don’t want to argue later about who gets the zombie artifacts.</p></div></div>`;
