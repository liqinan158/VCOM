The Romans added an “e” to the beginning and created the verb <i>eliminare</i>, which means to banish or to push over the threshold and out the door. If you solve a multiple-choice question on a test using the process of elimination, you rule out the wrong possibilities one by one until you find the right answer.</p></div></div>`;
