Sometimes, though less often, it also is used to refer to motorcycle riding.</p><p class="long">The roots of the word <i>cycling</i> are ancient. Both Latin and Greek have similar words that mean "circle, wheel." It's only natural, then, that a two-wheeled vehicle should be a bicycle and that <i>cycling</i> involves riding that vehicle. Occasionally, it can be used as a verb describing something going through a cycle, like a dishwasher cycling through.</p></div></div>`;
