When you're seated in first class on a jet, there's a <i>bulkhead</i> between you and the pilot's cabin.</p><p class="long">The bulkhead you're most likely to see is in a commercial airliner, dividing the flight crew from the passengers and sometimes the first class flyers from those in coach. Other vehicles have them too, including submarines and ships — these bulkheads help strengthen the vessels and keep different areas watertight. The Old Norse root of <i>bulkhead</i> is <i>bálkr</i>, "partition."</p></div></div>`;
