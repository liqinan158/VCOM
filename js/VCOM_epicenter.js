The epicenter is the place on the surface where those ripples start.  The Greek <i>epikentros</i> means “situated on a center,” and that’s where you’ll find the epicenter, dead center in an earthquake’s destruction.  Of course, you don’t really want to find it, because it’s kind of dangerous there.</p></div>`;
