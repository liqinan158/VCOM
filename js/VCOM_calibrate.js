For example, you might want to <i>calibrate</i> your bathroom scale now and then to be sure itâ€™s adjusted for exact weight.  Or <i>calibrate</i> it to read five pounds light. We won't tell.</p><p class="long">To find the origin of <i>calibrate</i>, we must look at its root, <i>caliber</i>, which appeared in the late 15th Century Middle French as <i>calibre</i>, meaning "a degree of importance." Linguists trace that word to an Arabic beginning, the word <i>qalib</i>, which referred to a mold for making bullets. That meaning seems to have carried over to our word, the verb <i>calibrate</i>, which first meant to measure the range of a projectile such as a bullet or shell.</p></div></div>`;
