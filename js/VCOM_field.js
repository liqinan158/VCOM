Think of a <i>field</i> as an area, either physically or subject-wise.</p><p class="long">A type of business or area of study is a field. All the subjects you study in school are different fields of study. Baseball players field a ball, and you need nine players to field a team. All the horses in a race are the field. Your field of vision is what you can see. Researchers go into the field to collect data — for an education researcher, that’s a school. Most fields are specific areas of one sort or another.</p></div></div>`;
