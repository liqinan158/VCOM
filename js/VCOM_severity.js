You might talk about the severity of the northern winter, or the severity of your grandfather's discipline.</p><p class="long"><i>Severity,</i> with its root in <i>severe,</i> has several nuances. It can mean a hardship, like war’s severity. It also refers to an extreme plainness. Think of the severity of Amish life: no phones, cars, or other modern technology. And you might use it to describe your math teacher’s manner: his severity is indicated by his short, clipped sentences, angry stare, and propensity to fail students without mercy.</p></div>`;
