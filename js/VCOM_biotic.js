var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">biotic</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The prefix "bio-" refers to "life," and the suffix "-ic" means "like" and makes a word an adjective, so you can figure that <i>biotic</i> describes something lifelike, as in "Evolution is simply <i>biotic</i> adaptation."</p><p class="long">As with so many scientific terms, the word <i>biotic</i> derives from the Greek <i>biotikos</i>, meaning "pertaining to life." Any ecosystem consists of the biotic entities — the living organisms — along with their physical environment, and the study of that ecosystem centers on the impact of one element on the other. Pioneer ecologist Aldo Leopold once said, “A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.”</p></div>`;
