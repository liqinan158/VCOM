So to <i>paraphrase</i> that explanation, it means to say something in other, simpler words.</p><p class="long">If you break <i>paraphrase</i> down, you end up with the prefix <i>para</i>, meaning "beside," and the word <i>phrase</i> — so think of <i>paraphrase</i> as coming up with similar, more simple phrases that go beside the ones already said. You might <i>paraphrase</i> your teacher’s lesson because you want to simplify her complicated technical language, or because you forgot exactly what she said but remember the general meaning.</p></div></div>`;
