You have to put some effort into saying the <i>dr-</i> sound. Then, as soon as you get through the breathy <i>-u-,</i> you’ve got two more hard sounds in <i>-dg-</i> and <i>-er-</i> before you get another break with the final vowel sound. Just as you might drag yourself doing those repetitive, grinding chores, you have to drag your way through pronouncing the word.</p></div>`;
