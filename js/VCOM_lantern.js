There are also modern ones — a <i>lantern</i> is any hand-held light with a see-through case. No ghosts necessary.</p><p class="long">Some lanterns have an actual flame inside, but others are battery operated, like flashlights, but lanterns usually provide more light. There are also paper lanterns, which are fun for parties, and if you use a pumpkin you have yourself a jack o’ lantern. <i>Lantern</i> comes from the Latin <i>lanterna</i>, "lantern, lamp, or torch," and shares the Greek root <i>lampein</i>, "to shine," with the English word <i>lamp</i>.</p></div></div>`;
