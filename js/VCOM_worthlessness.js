When you complain about your coworkers' <i>worthlessness</i>, you're talking about the fact that they don't contribute anything at work.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>worthlessness</i> can describe an object's lack of value, but it's more often used to describe a person — especially the way she feels about herself. For example, a depressed person might struggle with feelings of worthlessness — of not being useful or important in any way. The adjective <i>worthless</i> is at the root of <i>worthlessness</i>, with its meaning of "without value." Both words come from the Old English <i>weorþ</i>, "significant, of value, or appreciated."</p></div></div>`;
