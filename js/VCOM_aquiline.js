Believe it or not, this is a compliment.</p><p class="long"><i>Aquiline</i> comes from the Latin word <i>aquila</i>, for eagle. The ancient Greeks and Romans were crazy about eagles, and thought that if you saw an eagle flying on a significant day, like a battle, it was a sign that you were going to win. So it was a big compliment to say someone’s features were aquiline. It almost always refers to a long, curving nose. We also call it a "Roman nose."</p></div>`;
