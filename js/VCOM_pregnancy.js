For humans, <i>pregnancy</i> lasts about nine months, during which time the mother might want a chocolate chip and pickle sandwich. Get her one.</p><p class="long">Before a mother bear gives birth to a cub, or a mother cat has kittens, she goes through pregnancy. In humans, pregnancy is a time to prepare for a new baby while the mother-to-be does things like take special vitamins and choose a doctor or midwife to assist with the upcoming birth. Bears and cats just go for it. <i>Pregnancy</i> comes from the Latin <i>praegnans</i>, "with child" or "before birth," from <i>prae-</i>, "before," and <i>gnasci</i>, "be born."</p></div></div>`;
