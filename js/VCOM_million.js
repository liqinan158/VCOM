It's a large number made of a thousand thousands. If you have a <i>million</i> dollars, you’re a millionaire!</p><p class="long">The word <i>million</i> comes from the Italian <i>milione</i>, which literally means "a great thousand.” It’s great to have a thousand, but it’s awesome to have a million! A million is a big number but not so big that you don't see it used frequently. In fact, being a millionaire isn’t even a big deal anymore. An online video might be watched by a million viewers, and there are millions of people in big cities like New York City and Chicago.</p></div></div>`;
