If you make it to the final round of a tournament, that gives you <i>hope</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Hope</i> can also be a verb that means "strive for or wish," as in your hope to become a doctor someday. To hope is to want something to happen, but if instead you said that you intend to become a doctor, that suggests becoming a doctor is more of a goal than a dream. Hope, on the other hand, is more emotional. In fact, some scholars believe it's linked in meaning to <i>hop</i>, in that someone who hopes "leaps in expectation."</p></div>`;
