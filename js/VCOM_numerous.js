You wouldn’t use <i>numerous</i> to describe how many feet you have (just two), but you could use it to describe the infinite number of shoes in your closet.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>numerous</i> is related to the word <i>number</i> — which is no big surprise since it basically means "a large number of something." Use <i>numerous</i> to describe a copious or abundant amount that you can't give a specific number for. Numerous fans probably come out for the all-star game, for example. And numerous players wish they made the all-star team.</p></div></div>`;
