The sixth grader who's already asking questions about organic chemistry? They're both <i>precocious</i> â€” meaning they're way beyond their years in skill or knowledge.</p><p class="long">When you look at the Latin roots of <i>precocious</i>, it all makes sense. When <i>pre</i> (meaning "before") joins <i>coquere</i> (meaning "to ripen"), you have something that is ripening prematurely. And in the case of <i>precocious</i>, you are usually describing young people who have some adult-like quality about them. Maybe it's their vast vocabulary, maybe it's their ease with Calculus, or maybe it's just applying lipstick.</p></div></div>`;
