Small children require <i>supervision</i> when they're swimming, and a middle school math class needs <i>supervision</i> while they're taking a quiz.</p><p class="long">To watch over and keep people (or animals) safe, or to watch and manage them while they work, is to <i>supervise</i> them. The act of doing this is <i>supervision</i>. If your boss lets you work without supervision, that means that she doesn't feel the need to observe you while you get your job done. <i>Supervision</i> and <i>supervise</i> stem from the Latin roots <i>super</i>, "over," and <i>videre</i>, "to see."</p></div>`;
