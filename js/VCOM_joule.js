One <i>joule</i> is equal to the work it takes to make a watt of power for a second, or to move a body one meter with a one-Newton force.</p><p class="long">In physics, it's common to talk about joules of energy â€” one example used to illustrate a joule is lifting an apple, which weighs about one Newton. If you raise the apple one meter in the air, you've used one joule of work. The word <i>joule</i> comes from the English physicist James Prescott Joule, who studied the relationship between heat and mechanical work, research that led to the First Law of Thermodynamics.</p></div></div>`;
