var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">perceived</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If you sense something is true by instinct, but not necessarily by fact, you can describe that sense as <i>perceived</i>. If you suspect that your neighbor's dog might be dangerous, you can say the dog is a <i>perceived</i> threat to your family's safety.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>perceived</i> has its Latin roots in <i>per</i>, meaning "thoroughly," and <i>capere</i>, meaning "to grasp." Today it retains a sense of grasping something mentally or sensing it. Oddly, the word has two conflicting meanings: first, something you infer or suspect, rather than detecting with your senses. The second meaning, however, is quite the opposite: something sensed through your actual senses, especially those of sight or hearing.</p></div>`;
