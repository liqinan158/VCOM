A <i>dreamy</i> tune on the radio might make you close your eyes and smile.</p><p class="long">Your favorite tea shop might have a dreamy atmosphere, and your favorite movie might be slow and dreamy, with dreamlike images and meditative music. If a person is dreamy, she tends to live in her head, thinking or daydreaming. Informally, you can also describe something or someone that's wonderful or nice to look at as <i>dreamy</i>: "He's my favorite singer, and he's so <i>dreamy</i>." This casual meaning began as US teen slang in the 1940s.</p></div></div>`;
