Paraguay was a <i>buffer state</i> between Brazil and Argentina during the late 1800s.</p><p class="long">Diplomacy in Europe after the 1800s relied heavily on buffer states to keep things calm between more powerful countries. Buffer states don't allow neighboring countries to have a military presence within their borders, and if one of the hostile states invades or attacks the buffer state, the result is usually a military conflict between powers. The <i>buffer</i> in <i>buffer state</i> is defined as a "barrier that reduces shock between antagonistic people or things."</p></div></div>`;
