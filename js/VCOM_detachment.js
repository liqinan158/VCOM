Your <i>detachment</i> might mean that you don't cry on the last day of school with all your friends — you're just not that emotionally involved.</p><p class="long">When you have a sense of detachment from your surroundings, you're a bit aloof or apart, especially in an emotional way. A more physical kind of <i>detachment</i> is an actual coming apart, when something breaks or separates: "The <i>detachment</i> of the wall and the baseboard made it hard to paint the kitchen." Finally, there is a military meaning of <i>detachment</i> — a unit or group of soldiers sent on a separate mission.</p></div></div>`;
