var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">necessitate</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The verb <i>necessitate</i> shows that something is necessary or needs to happen, as when a sweet tooth can <i>necessitate</i> a trip to the store for a triple-scoop ice cream â€” which will <i>necessitate</i> a trip to the gym.</p><p class="long">Synonyms for <i>necessitate</i> are "require" and "force." Although what's required may be serious, <i>necessitate</i> also just labels things that follow naturally from one step to another. A dead car battery might necessitate a long walk home, or your completion of skills tests might necessitate moving up to the next level. <i>Necessitate</i> commonly replaces "need" when doctors talk about treatment, so while your scraped knee might need a big bandage, it may "<i>necessitate</i> treatment with antibiotics" if you go to a clinic.</p></div></div>`;
