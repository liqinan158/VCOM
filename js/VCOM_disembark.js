var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">disembark</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the verb <i>disembark</i> to describe leaving a ship, airplane or other type of vehicle, like making sure you haven't left anything in the plane's overhead compartment before you <i>disembark</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Embark</i> means "putting passengers in a plane or on a boat."  <i>Disembark</i> is its opposite. When you disembark, you leave a ship or a plane, like when you can't wait to disembark at the port in order to go sight-seeing. When you disembark, there is a transition — you walk down a gangplank to go from water to land or down a special corridor to get from the runway to the airport terminal — unlike when you get out of a car. That's why you wouldn't use <i>disembark</i> for getting out of a car.</p></div>`;
