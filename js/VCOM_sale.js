The <i>sale</i> of your old bike will happen more quickly if you price it at $50 instead of $500.</p><p class="long">You can talk about the sale of your next door neighbor's house, and you can also describe the house as "for <i>sale</i>," or available to be purchased. When a store has a <i>sale</i>, it means goods temporarily cost less than usual â€” you can also say that things at that store are "on <i>sale</i>." The word <i>sale</i> comes from the Old English <i>sala</i>, from a Germanic root.</p></div>`;
