But when they are sneaking to meet, notably as secret lovers, it's called a <i>tryst</i>.</p><p class="long">The origin of the word <i>tryst</i> comes from Middle English, and originally referred to a designated hunting station. Today it has come to refer to mainly romantic meetings, often with a secretive feel to it. (That's appropriate — aren’t we all hunting for love?) The word <i>tryst</i> might also suggest a hint of danger or intrigue. Perhaps the most romantic <i>tryst</i> in literature was the meeting between Romeo and Juliet — and just look where they ended up!</p></div></div>`;
