A <i>fascist</i> is a follower of a political philosophy characterized by authoritarian views and a strong central government — and no tolerance for opposing opinions.</p><p class="long"><i>Fascist</i> traces to the Italian word <i>fascio</i>, meaning "group, bundle." Under fascist rule, the emphasis is on the group — the nation — with few individual rights. You must support the ruling party's views on society, politics, and culture — or else. The term was used by Italian political leader Benito Mussolini under his totalitarian, anti-communist government. The word can describe someone who supports fascism — or whose behavior is so stern and controlling that it seems like he does.</p></div></div>`;
