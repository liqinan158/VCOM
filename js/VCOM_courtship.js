Most partners go through a <i>courtship</i> before deciding to get married.</p><p class="long"><i>Courtship</i> is an old-fashioned word, assuming that two people who love each other will eventually get married. If your uncle and aunt only met a few weeks before their wedding, you can say they had a brief courtship â€” and if you have friends who aren't married but have been together for years, you could describe their decades-long courtship. The word is indeed old-fashioned, from the 16th century when it meant "paying court to a woman with intention of marriage."</p></div></div>`;
