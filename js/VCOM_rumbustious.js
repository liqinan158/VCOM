In easygoing American English, we might refer to a <i>rambunctious</i> child, but before <i>rambunctious</i> there was <i>rumbustious</i>. That playful adjective goes all the way back to the late 18th century and still occasionally gets hauled out for comic effect, though using  <i>rambunctious</i> will get you fewer odd looks.</p></div></div>`;
