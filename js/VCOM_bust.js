A <i>bust</i> can also be a statue of someone from the shoulders up. Be careful to not <i>bust</i> a <i>bust</i> on your next field trip!</p><p class="long">Several meanings of <i>bust</i> are pretty discouraging. You might describe your business as bust if it's totally out of money, for example. Or you might threaten your younger sister, "If you <i>bust</i> my ceramic unicorn, you're in big trouble!" There's also the kind of bust that might sit on your piano, like a bust of Mozart or Bach â€” a statue of a person's head and upper shoulders. This is the oldest meaning of the word, from the Italian <i>busto</i>, "upper body."</p></div></div>`;
