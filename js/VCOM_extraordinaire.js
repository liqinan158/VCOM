You might describe your sister as a dog trainer <i>extraordinaire</i>, for example.</p><p class="long">If you know people who are truly outstanding at what they do, you might want to use <i>extraordinaire</i> when you talk about them. You could mention your neighbor, the cupcake baker extraordinaire, or your uncle who's an amateur magician extraordinaire. In either case, you're emphasizing how good they are at their particular talents. <i>Extraordinaire</i> is a French word that means "extraordinary, unusual, or out of the ordinary," and it's been used as a superlative in English since the 1940's.</p></div>`;
