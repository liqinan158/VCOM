Despite the stark cold, many animals thrive on the <i>tundra</i>, including insects, migrating birds, and foxes.</p><p class="long">A <i>tundra</i> is a great description of any stark icy cold place — say, the walk to class on a college campus during February — but it is an actual geographic location, near the Arctic circle in North America, Russia, and Scandinavia. Smaller <i>tundras</i> can exist near the South Pole but it's often too cold there. The word comes from the Finnish <i>tunturria</i> which means "barren land." Santa's reindeer live on the <i>tundra</i> and go by the name of <i>caribou</i> in North America. Of course, none of them can fly.</p></div>`;
