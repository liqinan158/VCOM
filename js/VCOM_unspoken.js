Even though it's not officially allowed, there may be an <i>unspoken</i> understanding that high school seniors will skip school on a certain spring day.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>unspoken</i> refers to thoughts or feelings that are implied even though they aren't voiced out loud. You and your best friends may have an unspoken assumption that you'll sit at the same cafeteria table every day at lunch. And when your parents are in bad moods, you and your sister might have an unspoken agreement that you'll take the dog for a walk together to give them some time to cool off.</p></div>`;
