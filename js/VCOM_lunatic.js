Someone driving too fast and zigging in and out of traffic is driving like a <i>lunatic</i>.</p><p class="long">The root of this word is <i>luna</i>, which means moon. That's because <i>lunatic</i> originally meant someone who went crazy with every phase of the moon, kind of like a werewolf. Most people these days don't believe in moon-caused insanity, but we still talk about lunatics, sometimes meaning clinically insane people. More often this is a slang term, used mainly in exaggerations, for anyone who seems wild and out of control.</p></div></div>`;
