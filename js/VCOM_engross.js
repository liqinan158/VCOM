Once you <i>engross</i> yourself in the culture of high salaries and unlimited spending accounts, it's hard to go back to cooking at a sandwich shop.</p><p class="long"><i>Engross</i> first came into English in the 1400s from the Old French word <i>en gros</i>, meaning "in bulk, at wholesale." By the 1700s the word had taken on the meaning of "absorb the whole attention." Immersing yourself fully in something can be good or bad. If you're studying Shakespeare, you want the plays to engross you so you don't lose focus. But if your video games engross you so much that you forget to shower or eat, that's a problem.</p></div>`;
