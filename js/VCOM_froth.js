You can use the word <i>froth</i> as a verb as well, to mean "fizz or foam up." Liquid soap might froth in your hands as you wash them, for example, and making candy sometimes involves cooking sugar syrup until it starts to froth. The word most likely comes from an Old Norse root, <i>fro√∞a</i>, or "froth."</p></div>`;
