Walking home from work on a <i>sweltering</i> day will leave you sweating.</p><p class="long">A sweltering summer afternoon might cause you to turn on the air conditioning in your apartment or take a cool shower. To be <i>sweltering</i> is more than merely being hot â€” it's the kind of damp, intense heat that sends everyone to the pool or beach for some relief. The verb <i>swelter</i> came first, from the now obsolete word <i>swelten</i>, "be faint from heat," rooted in the Old English <i>sweltan</i>, "to die or perish."</p></div></div>`;
