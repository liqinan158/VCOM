The cockroaches you found in your bathroom were the grossest <i>vermin</i> you'd ever seen.</p><p class="long">The word <i>vermin</i> originally came from the Anglo-French word of the same spelling, meaning "noxious animals" â€” definitely a negative term. Rats, mice, cockroaches, along with pests to farmers and the animals they raise, like coyotes and weasels, are vermin. Annoying people who cause problems are also sometimes called <i>vermin</i>, like the vermin who bully others.</p></div></div>`;
