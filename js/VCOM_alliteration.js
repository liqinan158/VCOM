For example, in <i>A Midsummer's Night Dream</i>, Shakespeare broke out the B's: "With bloody blameful blade he bravely broached his bloody boiling breast." And in the song "From A to G" by Blackalicious, a verse with words beginning with the "C" sound describes a "crazy character, constantly creating concoctions."</p></div>`;
