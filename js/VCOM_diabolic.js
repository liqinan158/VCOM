A <i>diabolic</i> boy might pick up a cat by its tail and swing it around.</p><p class="long">When people are <i>diabolic</i>, they're evil. The horrible dictator who has thousands of civilians killed commits a diabolic act, and people who abuse children are also diabolic. The bad guy in a fairy tale is always diabolic. You can use <i>diabolic</i> interchangeably with the slightly more common <i>diabolical</i>. Both words have a Greek root, <i>diabolikos</i>, which means "devilish" and comes from <i>diabolus</i>, or "devil."</p></div></div>`;
