A <i>lambent</i> glow is not a bright, blinding light.</p><p class="long"><i>Lambent</i> comes from a Latin word meaning "lick," and that fact may help you remember the word: lambent lights or flames aren't solid or powerful. The light is flickering â€” almost like the licking of a snake's tongue. Lambent light flickers or shines softly. It's not a powerful or overwhelming light. A candle in a dark room is a great example of a lambent light. Lambent light is better for setting a mood than lighting up a room brightly.</p></div></div>`;
