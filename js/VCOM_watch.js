If you agree to watch your neighbor's puppy, it means that you've promised to observe him carefully and make sure he doesn't get into trouble. When <i>watch</i> is a noun, it is the timepiece you wear on your wrist. Many people use their cell phones to get the time of day, instead of their watches.</p></div></div>`;
