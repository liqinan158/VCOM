If you dye your hair <i>magenta</i>, you'll really stand out in a crowd.</p><p class="long">Magenta is a shade that's related to colors like fire engine-red and hot pink â€” it's deep and bold. The color called <i>fuchsia</i> is nearly the same, a mixture of red and blue that's across from green on a color wheel (in other words, green is magenta's complementary color). Magenta-colored dye was first produced in the 1850s, and the color was named after the 1859 "Battle of Magenta" in the Second Italian War of Independence.</p></div>`;
