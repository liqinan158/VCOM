The scientific noun <i>molarity</i> describes the concentration of a substance as measured by the number of moles divided by the volume of the solution it's in. So a chemist might talk about the molarity of Sodium Chloride in a liter of water. <i>Molarity</i> comes from <i>mole</i>, which was coined by a German chemist from <i>Molek√ºl</i>, German for "molecule."</p></div>`;
