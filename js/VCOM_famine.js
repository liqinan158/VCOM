A <i>famine</i> is usually caused by crop failure or disaster.</p><p class="long">Although the "extreme shortage of food" meaning is most common, the noun <i>famine</i> can also mean any shortage or insufficiency, and it is often used idiomatically in the phrase "feast or <i>famine</i>." This usage refers to something that is alternately plentiful and scarce â€” like the feast and famine experienced by an artist who only occasionally sells his paintings.</p></div></div>`;
