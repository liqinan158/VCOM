You might see <i>risotto</i> on the menu at your favorite Italian restaurant.</p><p class="long">Risotto is starchy, rich, and flavorful, usually served warm with grated Parmesan cheese and a swirl of olive oil on top. Making risotto isn't difficult, but it does involve a lot of stirring over a relatively long period of time. A basic risotto recipe includes butter, onion or shallot, a little white wine, the short rice that's also called <i>risotto</i> (from the Italian <i>riso</i>, or "rice"), and savory broth. <i>Buon appetito</i>!</p></div></div>`;
