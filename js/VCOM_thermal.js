Wearing a <i>thermal</i> shirt under your sweater helps you stay warm on a brutally cold day.

Something that is thermal is hot, retains heat, or has a warming effect. If your sweatshirt has a thermal lining, its texture might remind you of a waffle-that's what traps your body heat. Also, there are large currents of warm air that flow upwards — these are what gliders or big birds like hawks ride to stay afloat — one type of those currents is called a “thermal.”</p></div>`;
