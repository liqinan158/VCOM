Popular clothes are in <i>fashion</i>.

But this word can also refer to a way something is done, as in "We train dogs in a certain fashion." To fashion something means to built it, as in "We fashioned a shelter out of rocks and mud." But that kind of fashioning probably isn't in fashion these days.</p></div>`;
