This is a medical word that spread to slang, and is today considered very insulting and inappropriate.</p><p class="long">Some uses of <i>retarded</i> are harmless, like if you said wearing a backpack retarded or slowed down your progress on a hike. However, if you use <i>retarded</i> to mean <i>stupid</i>, you're on dangerous ground. Out of respect for people who have clinical mental retardation, this is considered an offensive term to throw around.</p></div>`;
