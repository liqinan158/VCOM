And when you had to decide whether you were going to stay in Florida or move to Texas, even though you had a good job in Orlando you had a visceral feeling that Texas would be the right choice . . . and it turned out you were meant to be a rancher! <i>Visceral</i> can also mean “relating to the viscera,” with <i>viscera</i> being your organs.</p></div></div>`;
