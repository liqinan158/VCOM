If you lost two teeth in last year’s rugby season, you should be <i>chary</i> of signing up again this year.</p><p class="long"><i>Chary</i> comes from the Old English word <i>cearig</i> for "sorrowful, careful," which is basically what you are if you’re chary. If you’re a little suspicious of something and mulling it over, you’re being chary. A synonym of <i>chary</i> is <i>wary</i>, and both include caution, but some definitions suggest that it's obvious when someone is wary — it shows — while being chary is more of an inside, or hidden, distrust.</p></div></div>`;
