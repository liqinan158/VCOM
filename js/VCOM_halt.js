var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">halt</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Whether it's used as a noun or a verb, the word <i>halt</i> means <i>stop</i>. You can remember this by remembering that when you step on the brake to <i>halt</i> your car (verb), it comes to a <i>halt</i> (noun).</p><p class="long">English draws on both Romance and Germanic languages, and <i>halt</i> is one that comes from the Old High German <i>haltmachen</i>, which means "to hold." The word suggests a stoppage in the midst of action, and a Chinese proverb states, “We are not so much concerned if you are slow as when you come to a halt.” Consider, also, that a less-used definition of the word is that of "lame" or disabled, which still ties in with the idea of stopping.</p></div>`;
