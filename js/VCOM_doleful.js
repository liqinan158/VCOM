Unless one of those animals has a really sad look in its eyes. Expressions can be <i>doleful</i>, ditto a song or a set of circumstances. You can use the adjective <i>doleful</i> to describe something that is bringing you down, that makes you want to give into gravity or crawl into bed. <i>Doleful</i> is pretty much the opposite of how a ray of golden sun can make you feel.</p></div></div>`;
