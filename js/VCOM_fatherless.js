When Claudius killed Hamlet's father, Hamlet became <i>fatherless</i> and obsessed with vengeance.</p><p class="long">Use the adjective <i>fatherless</i> to describe your orphaned kitten, who has no parents and is therefore both motherless and fatherless. Usually, a fatherless person has lost his or her father to death, although you could also describe a girl raised only by her mother as a fatherless child. The root of <i>fatherless</i> is the similar Old English word <i>f√¶derleas</i>.</p></div></div>`;
