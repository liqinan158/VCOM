Then it's extortionate! This word, with its sense of exaggeration, is a great way to describe prices that shock you. It comes from <i>extortion</i>, the use of threats or physical force to get something (usually money) from someone. So even if no literal extortion is going on, you may still want to wield this powerful word: "That theater may be fancy, with those reclining seats, but ticket prices are extortionate!"</p></div></div>`;
