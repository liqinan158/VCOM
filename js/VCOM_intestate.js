Your great aunt may have intended to leave all her money to her cats, but unfortunately for Flufferkins and Mr. Wiggles, she died <i>intestate</i>.</p><p class="long">Like a lot of legal words, it might seem more straightforward to simply say, "without a will," but lawyers like to use Latin whenever possible. <i>Intestate</i> comes from the Latin <i>intestatus</i>, "without a will," from the root <i>testari</i>, "bear witness," which it shares with <i>testament</i>. When someone with a lot of money or property dies intestate, it can complicate things for the relatives they leave behind â€” it's not clear who gets what.</p></div>`;
