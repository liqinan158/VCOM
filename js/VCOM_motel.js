Many <i>motels</i> feature rooms with separate entrances that face a large parking lot.</p><p class="long">A motel is very much like a hotel â€” it fact, motels were originally "motor hotels." The first official motel was built in 1925, designed to be an easy, cheap stop on a long car trip. While hotels are often in the middle of cities, motels are usually on a city's outskirts, providing space to park and a quick walk from car to room. The popularity of motels increased through the twentieth century, along with the development of the modern highway system.</p></div>`;
