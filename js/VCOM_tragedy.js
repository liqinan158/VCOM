It would be a <i>tragedy</i> to lose your job, but an even greater <i>tragedy</i> to fall ill while unemployed and without health care.</p><p class="long">First recorded in the late 14th century, the noun <i>tragedy</i> originally referred to a play with an unhappy ending. About a century later it also came to mean an unhappy event or a disaster.  The playwright George Bernard Shaw wittily observed, "“There are two <i>tragedies</i> in life. One is to lose your heart's desire. The other is to gain it.”  The comedian Mel Brooks defined tragedy as follows: "<i>Tragedy</i> is when I cut my finger.  Comedy is when you walk into an open sewer and die."</p></div></div>`;
