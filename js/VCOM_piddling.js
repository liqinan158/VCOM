The adjective <i>piddling</i> is a favorite choice when sums of money are concerned; a more dignified, but no less contemptuous word, is <i>paltry</i>. <i>Piddling</i> comes from <i>piddle</i>, which has changed in meaning over the years â€” in the early 1600's it meant "pick at one's food," while by the late 1700's it meant "to urinate."</p></div>`;
