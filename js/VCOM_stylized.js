The heart-shaped symbol in the popular phrase "I heart NY," for example, is a classic <i>stylized</i> representation of a real heart.</p><p class="long">Anything can be <i>stylized</i> â€” an entire movie or play or wardrobe, for example. Superhero movies that make entire cities look like cartoons are <i>stylized.</i> The film director Elia Kazan summed up the difference between what is stylized and what is not nicely: "<i>Stylized</i> acting and direction is to realistic acting and direction as poetry is to prose." From the Old English word <i>stile</i> meaning "designation, title, manner or mode of expression."</p></div></div>`;
