If you go to a job interview looking <i>frowsy</i>, you're less likely to get the job than if you comb your hair and wear a tidy suit.</p><p class="long">If you sleep in your clothes so that you can roll out of bed in the morning and walk right out the door to catch a bus for school, you're in danger of looking frowsy. Frowsy people are untidy and scruffy â€” sometimes even dirty, with unwashed hair and grubby fingernails. <i>Frowsy</i> and its variation <i>frowzy</i> probably come from the now-obsolete adjective <i>frowsty</i>, "having an unpleasant smell."</p></div></div>`;
