Minor offenses are often brought before a <i>magistrate</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Magistrate</i> goes back to the Latin <i>magistratus</i>, meaning "administrator." Lawmakers and judges might have a role in making and changing laws; magistrates focus on carrying out the laws on a case-by-case basis. A magistrate doesn't usually make final rulings on murders or high-level cases. He or she might hear cases about things like property damage or traffic violations.</p></div></div>`;
