If you get lost on a <i>sinuous</i> mountain path, you'll need a compass or a GPS to figure out which direction leads back to camp.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>sinuous</i> comes from the Latin word <i>sinus</i>, which means to curve or bend. If you have a sinuous body, then you have lots of curves. Snakes use sinuous movements to travel. Live Oak trees have particularly sinuous branches. We usually use <i>sinuous</i> to talk about physical shapes of bodies or pathways, but you could also describe someone's logic as sinuous if it wanders all over the place when they're trying to explain something.</p></div>`;
