var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">spurned</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Someone who's <i>spurned</i> has been abandoned or rejected, usually by a romantic interest. If your significant other breaks up with you unexpectedly, you might feel <i>spurned.</i></p><p class="long">It's not easy to be a spurned lover, since the adjective implies total rejection by someone you love. A spurned groom, for example, might wait at the church on his wedding day for a bride who never shows up. The Old English root word of <i>spurned</i> makes this rejection pretty clear: <i>spurnan</i> means "to kick away,  reject, scorn, or despise."</p></div>`;
