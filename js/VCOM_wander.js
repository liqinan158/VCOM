If you're watching a boring movie, your mind might begin to <i>wander</i>. If you don't have a clear goal, you could <i>wander</i> too — meaning you drift aimlessly.</p><p class="long">When you wander mentally, your thoughts get lost. And when you wander physically, you don't have a destination, so it's also possible to lose your bearings and not know where you are — or how to get back. That's why <i>wander</i> is also used to describe someone who drifts from place to place or job to job without a sense of direction or purpose.</p></div></div>`;
