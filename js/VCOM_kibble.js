If your dog is sitting next to her dish and looking up at you with big, mournful eyes, she wants you to give her some <i>kibble</i>.</p><p class="long">You might be more likely to call kibble "dog food" or "cat food" â€” or even "guinea pig food." It's an all-purpose term for any kind of meal or feed that's formed into hard pellets, and it's a very common type of food for feeding pets and livestock. This word dates from around 1955, from a now uncommon verb meaning "to grind or chop coarsely."</p></div></div>`;
