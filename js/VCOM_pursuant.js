It's followed by the word "to." So you might say, "<i>Pursuant</i> to the judge's request, we'll provide additional testimony."</p><p class="long"><i>Pursuant</i> sounds a bit like <i>pursue</i>, and has a related meaning in the sense of "following" — but in this case it's an agreement or ruling that you're following. <i>Pursuant</i> comes from the French word <i>pursuer</i>, meaning "to follow with hostile intent." Over time the word lost its sense of hostility — unless of course you're angry when the lawyer tells you that pursuant to the investment policy, you can't withdraw all your money and run away to Paris.</p></div>`;
