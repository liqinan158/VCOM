Your <i>outre</i> outfit might be fine to wear to a Halloween party but less appropriate for a job interview.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>outre</i> is often spelled with its French accent: <i>outr√©</i>. In French, this word means "exaggerated, excessive, or extreme," and is a past participle of the verb <i>outrer</i>, "to carry to excess or overdo," from <i>outre</i>, "beyond." If something is beyond what's considered normal or ordinary, it's <i>outre</i>: "His one-man play was so bizarrely <i>outre</i> that the audience didn't know how to respond."</p></div></div>`;
