They're not suited to the occasion or done in polite company. They’re just not proper!</p><p class="long">Surprise! <i>Improper</i> is the opposite of <i>proper</i>. Something that’s improper goes against what people think is right. This could be a matter of politeness. For example, not giving up your seat for an elderly person is improper. Or it could be more serious, like going to school with no pants on. It could also be something uncool like meeting your best friend’s boyfriend for coffee without telling her. All improper things are wrong in someone's eyes.</p></div></div>`;
