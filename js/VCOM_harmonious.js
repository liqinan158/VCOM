But this concept applies to many other things and people, too. You could say pieces of art that look good next to each other are harmonious. A basketball team that shares the ball and gets along well is harmonious. Anytime people get along, they're being harmonious. In a totally harmonious society, there would be no war or hate.</p></div>`;
