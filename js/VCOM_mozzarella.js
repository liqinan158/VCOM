If you love that stretchy white melted cheese on your slice of pepperoni, you're a fan of <i>mozzarella</i>.</p><p class="long">Traditionally, mozzarella has been made from Italian water buffalo milk, although these days it's common to find cow's milk mozzarella in the store. Mozzarella is pale in color and very moist. Fresh mozzarella comes in liquid brine, and must be eaten within a few days, although shelf-stable "low-moisture" mozzarella lasts much longer and often comes already shredded. The name <i>mozzarella</i> comes from the Italian <i>mozzare</i>, "to cut off."</p></div>`;
