You can attach a small lawn <i>sprinkler</i> to a hose in your yard when your flowers are looking droopy.</p><p class="long">Sprinklers are mainly used to irrigate, or provide water, to plants. There are complex systems of sprinklers that can be installed in the ground for a large area, like a public park or an estate's acres of lawns. The more common type of sprinkler hooks up to a hose and can be moved wherever it's needed â€” including in the middle of a yard for kids to run through in their bathing suits.</p></div>`;
