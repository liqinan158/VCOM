If you live in Vermont, your car windshield is probably <i>frosty</i> most winter mornings.</p><p class="long">You can describe the weather as <i>frosty</i> when there's a sharp chill in the air, or you can use the word more literally, to mean "covered in frost," like your frosty front lawn. When a person is frosty, however, she's emotionally cold â€” haughty, aloof, or even unfriendly. <i>Frosty</i> comes from the Old English <i>fyrstig</i>, "as cold as frost."</p></div>`;
