If you're a student who helps others and in return earns credits for a class, that's one example.</p><p class="long">The Latin <i>mūtuus</i>, meaning "reciprocal," gave the basis for the 15th Century Middle French word <i>mutuel</i>. In 1849, French Socialist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon coined the word <i>mutualism</i> to describe his financial theories.  The new word was later applied to biological systems of interdependence. Sometimes mutualism is confused with symbiosis, but they are not the same, in part because in mutualism both parties gain from the relationship, while only one side has to benefit to be classified as symbiosis.</p></div></div>`;
