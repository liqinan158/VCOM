Many people feel a sense of <i>peacefulness</i> when they're hiking in the woods.</p><p class="long">One kind of peacefulness is quiet and restful, the sort you find at a yoga studio or on an empty stretch of beach. <i>Peacefulness</i> can also refer to an absence of conflict or violence â€” though it's more common to call this peace. The root of both words is the Latin <i>pacem</i>, which means "peace treaty, tranquility, agreement, or compact."</p></div></div>`;
