You can say, "I did really <i>well</i> on my French test," or "Finally, I slept <i>well</i> last night."</p><p class="long">When <i>well</i> is a noun, it means "a deep hole full of water or oil." When <i>well</i> is an adverb, it describes the way something's done. If you're not sure when to use <i>well</i> and when to use <i>good</i>, think about what you're describing. If it's a thing, then you can call it <i>good</i>, like a "<i>good</i> book." If you're talking about an action, you should use <i>well</i>: "I always do <i>well</i> on math quizzes," or "You speak Chinese really <i>well</i>."</p></div></div>`;
