When you find out that you just won the lottery, feel free to jump up and down with <i>unbridled</i> joy. Go ahead, most people would probably let loose in the same way.</p><p class="long">A <i>bridle</i> is the contraption used to control a horse, including the reins held by the rider and the bit that goes into the horse’s mouth. Add the <i>un</i> prefix and it means there is no control. <i>Unbridled</i> is often used to describe people’s emotions or actions and it can be either a good or a bad thing. If you have unbridled spending, you’re in danger of going in debt. If you tackle homework with unbridled enthusiasm, you’re likely going to get good grades.</p></div></div>`;
