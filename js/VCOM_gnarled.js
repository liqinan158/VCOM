But <i>gnarled</i> means rugged, roughened and knotty, like the hands of an old wood carver, as well as the wood he carves.</p><p class="long">We owe the adjective <i>gnarled</i> and other forms of the word to our friend Shakespeare, who created it in 1603. In “Measure for Measure,” he writes, “Thy sharpe and sulpherous bolt splits the un-wedgable and gnarled oak.” But <i>gnarled</i> didn't come into use again until the 19th century. In any case, word experts believe it's related to the Middle English word <i>knar</i> which means “knot in wood.”</p></div></div>`;
