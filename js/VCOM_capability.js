Note the fine distinction between them. If you have an ability, it means you know how to do something. If you have a capability, it means you have the power to do something. Buying uranium gives a country the <i>capability</i> of making nuclear weapons, but first they need scientists with the <i>ability</i> to do the work.</p></div>`;
