You might love to <i>hike</i> in the woods on weekends.</p><p class="long">When you hike, you walk for pleasure, often in a wooded or hilly area. The trip itself is also a <i>hike</i>, whether you hike the Appalachian Trail or climb a local hill. Another meaning of <i>hike</i> is "to increase," as when the library decides to hike the fees for late books. <i>Hike</i> has been around since the 1800's, when it was spelled <i>hyke</i>, but its origin is uncertain. The "walk vigorously" meaning is older than the "raise or increase" meaning.</p></div></div>`;
