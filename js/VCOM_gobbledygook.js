The mechanic might try to explain what's wrong with your car, but to you it just sounds like <i>gobbledygook</i>.</p><p class="long">Like <i>gibberish</i>, <i>gobbledygook</i> is essentially meaningless to the person listening to or reading it. What distinguishes gobbledygook is that it includes technical terms or overblown, complicated words that aren't necessary. A good editor will take a technical writer's gobbledygook and translate it into ordinary English that anyone can understand. The inventor of this term was a Texas politician who used "activation" and "implementation" as examples of gobbledygook.</p></div>`;
