Living in a <i>duplex</i> is great â€” unless the people with whom you share a wall like to have all-night yodeling parties.</p><p class="long">In the U.K. a duplex is an apartment with an upstairs and a downstairs, but in North America a duplex is a building divided into two separate living spaces. Most duplexes are built with the two homes side by side, although you can also live in a duplex with apartments on two floors. The Latin <i>duplex</i> means "twofold," from <i>duo</i>, "two," and <i>-plex</i>, "to intertwine." The word was coined in the U.S. around 1922.</p></div></div>`;
