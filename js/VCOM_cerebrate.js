When you're completing the essay section of a test, you should leave yourself enough time to <i>cerebrate</i> before you start writing.</p><p class="long">If you love to cerebrate, you may want to be a philosopher some day, spending your time thinking and reasoning about various subjects. This verb comes from <i>cerebration</i>, or "the thought process." You need a high-functioning brain in order to cerebrate well, and it's no coincidence: the Latin root is <i>cerebrum</i>, or "brain."</p></div></div>`;
