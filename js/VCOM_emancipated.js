A classic example of this is a woman who has escaped societal expectations of what women should do to live the life she chooses, or a member of a minority group who has become emancipated to achieve equality within his society. <i>Emancipated</i> can also describe a person who has turned 18 and is no longer a minor â€” old enough to be treated as an adult and not legally controlled by his or her parents.</p></div></div>`;
