They're usually black and white but occasionally gray or brown. If your dog has ever met a skunk face-to-face, or startled one, you know how powerful a skunk's smell can be. It's an odor that's hard to get rid of â€” and it's strong enough to keep predators like bears far away. <i>Skunk</i> most likely comes from an Abenaki root.</p></div>`;
