If you travel to the southwestern United States, you'll see many homes with <i>stucco</i> exteriors and terra-cotta roof tiles.</p><p class="long">Stucco is a type of plaster, a substance that goes on as a wet paste and dries hard. In fact, in Italian, <i>stucco</i> means "plaster," from a Germanic source it shares with the Old High German <i>stukki</i>, or "crust." Stucco is mainly decorative, often covering metal or cinderblock, but it's also a weather-resistant coating. While regular plaster is usually smooth and white, stucco is most often textured.</p></div></div>`;
