If you're a chef, your divine steak frites might be your métier. If you're a mechanic, your ability to understand transmissions may be your métier. Often used interchangeably with <i>forte</i>, meaning "strong point." As the accent over the "e" in <i>métier</i> implies, it's originally from the French, because the French, darn them, are good at so many things. Particularly steak frites.</p></div></div>`;
