Something that's <i>granulated</i> is made up of many tiny pieces.</p><p class="long">You're most likely to read the word <i>granulated</i> on the side of a bag of sugar, particularly if it's roughly milled. Think white or brown sugar, rather than powdered sugar. Sand is granulated, and so is ground coffee, and some grainy fertilizers you might spread on your garden. The <i>gran</i> in the word <i>granulated</i> gives a clue about its meaning â€” it comes from the Latin <i>granum</i>, which means "grain or seed."</p></div></div>`;
