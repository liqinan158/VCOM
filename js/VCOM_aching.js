After a hike up the side of a steep mountain or a long day walking around a city, you'll want to rest your <i>aching</i> feet.</p><p class="long">To <i>ache</i> is to feel a dull, constant pain, and <i>aching</i> things ache. Both words stem from the Old English <i>acan</i>, "suffer pain," from a Proto-Indo-European root that might be imitative of a groaning sound, the kind of noise you may make when you have an aching head or an aching tooth. Things are sometimes described as <i>aching</i> in a figurative way, too, when they're full of sorrow, like an aching heart or an aching loneliness.</p></div></div>`;
