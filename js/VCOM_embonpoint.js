It comes from the phrase "en bon point," which literally means "in good shape."</p><p class="long"><i>Embonpoint</i> is generally a compliment, not a criticism — it doesn't mean overweight or fat. You can use <i>embonpoint</i> as a noun or as an adjective: "Your <i>embonpoint</i> friend looks wonderfully curvy in her new dress." Although this word is usually used to describe bodies, the Romantic poet John Keats takes some poetic license when he describes eating a nectarine: “It went down soft, pulpy, slushy, oozy — all its delicious <i>embonpoint</i> melted down my throat like a large beatified Strawberry.”</p></div>`;
