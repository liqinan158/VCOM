If usurping thrones is your thing, then maybe you have a future as a <i>supplanter</i>.</p><p class="long">A supplanter takes the place of someone or something that was there first. For example, a new big-name donut shop may become a supplanter if it hurts or ruins the business of the local Mom and Pop donut shop. <i>Supplanter</i> often refers to governments and rulers of countries, and it comes from the verb <i>supplant</i>, which evolved from the Latin <i>supplantare</i>, meaning "to trip up or to overthrow."</p></div></div>`;
