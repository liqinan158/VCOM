If you <i>osculate</i> your dog on the mouth, some of your family members will laugh while others will be disgusted.</p><p class="long">The kind of kiss you give when you osculate is by definition either a goofy one or an almost exaggeratedly formal one, like a dapper gentleman who kisses a lady's hand. There is also a mathematical definition of <i>osculate</i>, which is almost like a math kiss: when two surfaces or two curves touch in at least three points. The Latin root word is <i>osculum</i>, kiss, or literally little mouth.</p></div></div>`;
