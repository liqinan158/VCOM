This makes sense because you are inserting a plug into itâ€”some purists argue that it has to be called an <i>outlet</i> because power comes out  of it, but it's a perfectly good way to use the word. There are also anatomical sockets in our bodies, like eye sockets into which eyeballs fit neatly, and ball-and-socket joints, like hips and shoulders.</p></div></div>`;
