However, you’d think wrong, because this is exactly what chitterlings are: a pig’s small intestines. Chitterlings are then boiled or fried, and they’re often filled with mincemeat. Chitterlings can come from other animals too, but they’re usually from a pig. If you eat these on a regular basis, you may know them as <i>chitlins</i>.</p></div></div>`;
