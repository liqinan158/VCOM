People often say, "I don't <i>condone</i> what he did, but I understand it." Condoning is like excusing something. People seem to talk more about things they don't condone than things they do condone. Your mom might say, "I don't <i>condone</i> you staying up till 10, but I know you need to read." That's a way of giving approval and not giving approval at the same time.</p></div></div>`;
