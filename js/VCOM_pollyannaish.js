If your friend tells you some terribly bad news, it would be <i>pollyannaish</i> to say, "Yes, but it's such a beautiful day!"</p><p class="long">While the adjective <i>pollyannaish</i> describes an optimistic outlook and a determined cheeriness, it also implies that this attitude is taken too far. When you put a positive spin on everything, even things that call for sadness or discouragement, you're being pollyannaish. The word comes from a 1913 children's book by Eleanor H. Porter, <i>Pollyanna</i>, about a young girl who tries to find something positive in every situation — a trick she calls "the Glad Game."</p></div></div>`;
