A patient only has a <i>pacemaker</i> implanted when his own heart isn't working well on its own.</p><p class="long">The human heart has a natural pacemaker that makes it beat at an appropriate rate to keep blood flowing throughout the body. Sometimes it doesn't work right, because of some kind of blockage or other problem that causes the heart to beat too slowly. In these cases, cardiologists — or heart doctors — will often surgically implant an electronic pacemaker as a replacement. Pacemaker research began in 1899, but it wasn't until 1958 that the first patients received these lifesaving devices.</p></div></div>`;
