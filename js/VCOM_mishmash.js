Many people have a <i>mishmash</i> of things in their basement or garage. A pile of old keys, one sock, four paper clips, and a water bottle? Total <i>mishmash</i>.</p><p class="long">Many houses have one kitchen drawer full of a mishmash of pens, rubber bands, carryout menus, and gum, for example. If you write a last-minute research paper, you might wind up with a mishmash of random ideas and opinions. The word was originally spelled with a hyphen, <i>mish-mash</i>, and before that it was <i>mysse-masche</i>, which had to do with mash, as in a bunch of soft food chucked together and fed to pigs. Another word for <i>mishmash</i> is <i>hodgepodge</i>.</p></div></div>`;
