Disneyâ€™s Bambi is a famous <i>deer</i>. There are <i>deer</i> all over the world, but American <i>deer</i> are light brown, and are often found nibbling on plants at dusk.</p><p class="long">The main thing that distinguishes deer from other horned animals, like antelope, is that deer shed their antlers once a year and grow new ones. A female deer, called a "doe," has smaller antlers than the male, or "buck." The Old English root of <i>deer</i>, <i>deor</i>, means "beast" or "animal," and was originally used generally to refer to all four-legged wild animals.</p></div>`;
