The <i>essence</i> of Las Vegas is poker chips and dreams; the <i>essence</i> of Johnny Cash is black clothing and country music.</p><p class="long"><i>Essence</i> can be a physical detail, or, just as commonly, the abstract idea or meaning of something. The essence of <i>Lady Chatterly's Lover</i> might be its revolutionary eroticism, or the essence of religion its devotion to God. <i>Essence</i> can also mean the concentrate obtained from a flower or plant for flavoring. If you've chewed strawberry-flavored bubblegum you're probably amazed at how it truly is the very essence of strawberries.</p></div>`;
