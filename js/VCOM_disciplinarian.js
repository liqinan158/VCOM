Many <i>disciplinarians</i> also believe in using harsh punishments for those who break those rules.</p><p class="long">The word <i>disciplinarian</i> is all about <i>discipline</i>, which originally meant "punishment for the sake of correction." The Latin root, <i>disciplina</i>, was a lot more about teaching, instruction, and knowledge than punishment, though. Today, a disciplinarian's intent is both to instruct by means of explicit rules and to punish when those rules aren't followed. If your disciplinarian parents tell you to take the trash out, you're probably quick to follow their instructions.</p></div></div>`;
