This isn’t a joke, it’s an example of <i>herbivorous</i> creatures who exist on a diet of plant life only.</p><p class="long"><i>Herbivorous</i> comes from the Latin word <i>herba</i>, which means “green plants,” and that’s what herbivorous animals eat all the time: grass, leaves, and other plants.  Some massive and strong animals actually have peaceful herbivorous eating habits, like gorillas and hippopotamuses.  The opposite of <i>herbivorous</i> is <i>carnivorous</i>, which describes meat-eating beasts like lions, sharks, crocodiles, and your uncle Marvin who eats nothing but steak all day long.</p></div></div>`;
