A trip to the dentist might cause a cavity-prone person a lot of <i>anguish</i>.</p><p class="long">We get this word from a Latin word, <i>angustus</i>, which literally meant "narrow" but developed the figurative sense of "distressed" â€” think of being choked off or forced into a small space. In modern times <i>anguish</i> has been in the English with the parallel and related meanings of "physical torment" and "emotional suffering." Both kinds might be experienced at the hands of a dentist who likes to make his patients squirm in agony.</p></div></div>`;
