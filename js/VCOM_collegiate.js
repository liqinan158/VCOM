You might refer to the leagues in which college athletes compete as <i>collegiate</i> sports, or to students studying chemistry as <i>collegiate</i> scientists.</p><p class="long">While <i>college</i> is a noun, <i>collegiate</i> is an adjective used to describe anything associated with college. The word <i>collegiate</i> was once associated with the idea of ivy-covered walls and impeccably-dressed students earnestly discussing philosophy and art. Nowadays, it can just as easily refer to political demonstrations and raucous behavior, as all have become part of the collegiate world.</p></div></div>`;
