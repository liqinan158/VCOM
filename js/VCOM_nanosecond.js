In other words, a <i>nanosecond</i> is one billionth of a second. Even a blink lasts longer than that.</p><p class="long">One nanosecond compares to a second the same way one second compares to 31.71 years. It's such a tiny amount of time that it's almost impossible to imagine. Some scientists call a nanosecond a "light foot," since light can travel approximately one foot in one nanosecond. You can also use this word figuratively, to mean "a really short length of time." <i>Nano-</i> comes from the Greek root <i>nanos</i>, "a dwarf."</p></div></div>`;
