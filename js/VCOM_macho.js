A boxer might try to intimidate his opponent by walking into the ring with a <i>macho</i> swagger.</p><p class="long">To be macho is to display a tough, fierce, overly confident facade. A man who's macho would never cry or sip a cup of tea or pet a kitten, because none of these things would be seen as "manly" enough. In Spanish, <i>macho</i> means "male animal," from the Latin root <i>masculus</i>, also "male," but also "worthy of a man."</p></div>`;
