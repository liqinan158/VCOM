Sounds great, except it usually means the poor residents can’t afford to live there anymore and have to move.</p><p class="long">In the United Kingdom, the <i>gentry</i> are the highest class of people aside from royalty.  When you add -<i>fication</i> (the suffix that means “making”), you see how <i>gentrification</i> means "making something suitable for a higher class of people," usually the middle class (the upper class already have their mansions).  When a neighborhood goes through gentrification, buildings get makeovers, new businesses open, and many people who’ve lived there their entire lives must leave because everything gets more expensive.</p></div>`;
