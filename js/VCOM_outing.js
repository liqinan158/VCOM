For example, you might ask your pal if he'd like to go on an <i>outing</i> to the zoo.</p><p class="long">A summer outing might be a picnic or a day at the beach, while a winter outing could consist of a hike in the snow or a shopping trip and lunch at a restaurant. Any brief, fun journey can be called an <i>outing</i>. In the fourteenth century, an <i>outing</i> was simply the "action of going out," and in the fifteenth century it started to mean "act of putting out" as well. By the 1800s it had gained today's definition.</p></div>`;
