A <i>distasteful</i> movie might disturb you so much that you leave the theater before it's over.</p><p class="long">While certain kinds of food might be distasteful to you — overcooked vegetables, for example — you can find non-edible things just as distasteful, despite the <i>taste</i> within the word. This adjective uses the sense of <i>taste</i> that means "preference" or "tendency to like something," along with the prefix <i>dis-</i>, "not" or "the opposite of." You can, for example, find things like greed and cruelty to be just as distasteful as overcooked broccoli.</p></div>`;
