Your jacket's <i>lapel</i> is connected to your collar.</p><p class="long">Fancy or dressy men's clothing tends to have lapels â€” the tuxedo you wear to your uncle's wedding might have a satin lapel, for example. The suits that businessmen (and often women) wear also have lapels. Lapels come in different shapes and widths, although they almost always have a buttonhole on the left side, originally intended for wearing a flower. These days only prom- and wedding-goers tend to stick a flower in their lapel.</p></div></div>`;
