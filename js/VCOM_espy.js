If you look through binoculars long enough, you might <i>espy</i> a colorful bird.</p><p class="long">Though you can use the verb <i>espy</i> whenever you want to say "see," "spot," or "notice," it's primarily a literary word that you'll mostly find in books. One character might espy another strolling in a garden, or a pipe-smoking detective might espy a clue behind a parlor door. <i>Espy</i> comes from the Old French <i>espiier</i>, "observe, watch or spy on," from a Germanic root.</p></div></div>`;
