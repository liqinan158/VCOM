To manipulate the boundaries like this — often viewed as unfair — is to <i>gerrymander</i>.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>gerrymander</i> first appeared in 1812 when Massachusetts governor Elbridge Gerry redrew district boundaries, hoping it would help his party in an upcoming senate election. Then somebody noticed that the new district looked like a salamander, so they combined <i>Gerry</i> and -<i>mander</i> to create the new word <i>gerrymander</i>. And then a newspaper printed a cartoon with a giant salamander making fun of Gerry, which is what happens to politicians who don’t behave.</p></div></div>`;
