They're a lot easier to spot at night, because they glow, giving off light and looking like flying, dancing night lights. The word for creatures and things like lightning bugs is <i>phosphorescent</i>. Phosphorescent things give off hardly any heat, but they radiate light. Glow-in-the-dark toys are phosphorescent. It can help you remember this word if you know that phosphorus is a substance that emits light, so anything that does so is phosphorescent.</p></div>`;
