To <i>surmise</i> is to form an opinion or make a guess about something.</p><p class="long">If you surmise that something is true, you don't have much evidence or knowledge about it. Near synonyms are <i>guess, conjecture,</i> and <i>suppose</i>. You might say, "I can't even surmise what he would do in such a situation." <i>Surmise</i> came to English from the French <i>surmettre</i>, "to accuse," which is formed from the prefix <i>sur-</i>, "on, upon," plus <i>mettre</i>, "to put" (from Latin <i>mittere</i>, "to send").</p></div>`;
