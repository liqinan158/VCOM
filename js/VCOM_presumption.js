var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">presumption</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The noun <i>presumption</i> pretty much means jumping to conclusions. It is taking something for granted — an idea, an answer, an event — without having any real knowledge about it, and that is usually not a good thing.</p><p class="long">Making a <i>presumption</i> means assuming something is true or false without getting all the information necessary for verification. You can decipher this from the prefix <i>pre</i>, which means "before," together with the <i>sume</i> — from the Latin <i>sumere</i>, "to take." Because so many times a presumption turns out to be false, the word has a negative connotation to it; there's something reckless about making up your mind before you know all the facts.</p></div>`;
