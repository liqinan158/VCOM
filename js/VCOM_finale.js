(If it’s truly spectacular, it might even be called a “grand <i>finale</i>.”) Appropriately, the pronunciation of <i>finale</i> contains a final flourish that you just can’t miss: the letter <i>e</i>, which you might expect to be silent, is pronounced. The last two syllables of <i>finale</i> rhyme with <i>alley</i>.</p></div>`;
