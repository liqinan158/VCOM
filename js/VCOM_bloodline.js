Sometime a horse's bloodline is also a selling point, particularly when someone is betting on a race horse. You have a bloodline too, although the word more often describes the heritage of a famous or royal family. The Old English root word <i>blod</i>, means "blood." By the 13th century, <i>blood</i> also meant "family" or "heritage."</p></div></div>`;
