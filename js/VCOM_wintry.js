Use the adjective <i>wintry</i> to describe a cold, gray January day.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>wintry</i> is sometimes spelled <i>wintery</i>. Either way, it describes something that happens in the winter time, or that reminds you of winter in some way. A photograph of your uncle's snow-covered Christmas tree farm shows a wintry scene, and a blustery wind on a February morning will feel wintry. It can also describe a person who is emotionally cool or unfriendly: "Her greeting was <i>wintry</i>, and she refused to shake my hand."</p></div>`;
