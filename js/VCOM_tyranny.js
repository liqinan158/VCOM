Don't accuse your mother of <i>tyranny</i> just because she won't let you play video games all weekend long.</p><p class="long">One of the root words of <i>tyranny</i> is the Latin <i>tyrannia</i> which means the "rule of a tyrant" and a <i>tyrant</i> is a "cruel master." Today, it can mean the repressive regime of a dictator or it can also mean being controlled by something metaphorically harsh like time or work. Maybe the oldest example of a <i>tyranny</i> is that of <i>Tyrannosaurus Rex</i>, or "king of the giant lizards," who many of us grew up thinking was the largest, most predatory and frightening of the dinosaurs who supposedly ruled over the rest of the dinosaur world with its huge, sharp teeth and claws.</p></div>`;
