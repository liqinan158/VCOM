A charismatic speaker might <i>bedazzle</i> her audience so much that they all want to buy her new book.</p><p class="long">Something can literally bedazzle you, or blind you a little bit: the sun glinting off the ocean around your sailboat might bedazzle you. It's more common, however, to find this verb used in a figurative way, when a person amazes or impresses you. The root of <i>bedazzle</i>, the Middle English <i>dasen</i>, or "daze," possibly stems from the Middle Dutch word of the same spelling, which means "act silly."</p></div></div>`;
