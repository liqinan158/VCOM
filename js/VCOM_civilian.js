It can also refer to any object that is not military in origin â€” e.g., "<i>civilian</i> clothes" or "<i>civilian</i> life."</p><p class="long">The meaning of <i>civilian</i> as a non military person is a relatively new one, dating from the early 19th century. Before that it referred to the code of law that governed non-military life. In fact for hundreds of years a civilian was somebody who was a judge or otherwise an expert on the law that applied outside military courts. Because it comes originally from a French word, remember to spell it with only one "l," even though it sounds like it should have two.</p></div>`;
