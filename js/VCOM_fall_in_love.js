You might dream that you'll travel to Paris someday and <i>fall in love</i> with a beautiful French woman.</p><p class="long">The moment when you pass from a state of being friends with a person to loving him in a romantic way is when you fall in love. For some people, that happens once in a lifetime â€” others fall in love over and over again. <i>Fall in love</i> has been around since at least the 1500's, and it comes from the sense of <i>fall</i> that means "occur or become apparent, especially suddenly." Other similar phrases are <i>fall asleep</i> or <i>fall behind</i>.</p></div>`;
