Your favorite thing about winter might be watching the skaters in the park <i>glide</i> silently on the ice-covered lake.</p><p class="long">A sled glides down a snowy hill, and a kayak glides across a silvery pond. Another way to glide is to soar in the air: your paper airplane, if you make it the right way, will glide all the way across the room, and a hawk can glide through the sky without seeming to move its wings. A different kind of <i>glide</i> is linguistic, a sound that's pronounced like a vowel but functions as a consonant.</p></div>`;
