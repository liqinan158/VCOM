You'll often hear <i>provisional</i> used to describe things such as governments, elections, contracts, and agreements, all of which can change into something permanent.</p><p class="long">People who go camping take <i>provisions</i>, which means supplies for the trip. This can be helpful when you're trying to use <i>provisional</i> properly. Remember that those provisions are, well, provisionalâ€”they're only supposed to last until the campers get home, where the real food is waiting. If you're in a rush to start filming, you might consider giving your star a provisional contract, so that you can at least get started. You'll have time to replace the provisional one with a permanent one while you film.</p></div>`;
