If you visit a farm in the springtime you'll get to see all the calves, ducklings, lambs, chicks, and <i>goslings</i>!</p><p class="long">The word <i>gosling</i> has Scandinavian roots — it comes from the Old Norse <i>gæslingr</i>, adding a diminutive suffix to <i>gos</i>, or "goose." So a gosling is essentially a "gooseling," like a duckling, a smaller and cuter version of an animal. Goslings hatch from eggs in nests built close to a body of water, and they are taught to swim and feed in the water almost immediately after they hatch.</p></div>`;
