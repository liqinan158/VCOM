It can also be a circumstance that hampers you, like a dead car that keeps you from traveling very far from home. The noun <i>limitation</i> comes up a lot in the law, especially in the phrase "statute of <i>limitations</i>," which dictates how long after a crime someone can be prosecuted for committing it.</p></div>`;
