It’s all about presentation. If you’re having trouble selling lemonade out of an old pickle jar, perhaps you should change the <i>packaging</i>.</p><p class="long">Walk through a supermarket or a drug store and you'll see many different kinds of packaging, from hard plastic medicine bottles to cardboard cereal boxes and glass jars of spaghetti sauce. You can call the act or business of putting all these items into containers <i>packaging</i> too. There's also a figurative meaning of this noun, "presenting something in a flattering or beneficial way," as in: "The advisors' <i>packaging</i> of the candidate makes him seem much smarter."</p></div></div>`;
