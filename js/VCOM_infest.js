Bedbugs can <i>infest</i> people's belongings and even their bodies, or mice may <i>infest</i> your kitchen if you leave the cheese out too often.</p><p class="long"><i>Infest</i> comes from Latin: <i>in-</i> means "not" and <i>festus</i> means "able to be seized." So <i>infest</i> describes something is not able to be seized, typically because it's present in such large numbers. For example, mosquitoes may infest your backyard during the summer and annoy you when you're trying to relax. <i>Infest</i> is usually used to describe pests, such as bugs or rodents, that overrun something in such large number that they are difficult to control.</p></div>`;
