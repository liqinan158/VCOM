Some players <i>bunt</i> so that another runner can get from second to third base.</p><p class="long">The bunt is a rarely-used technique in baseball. When a batter bunts, the ball doesn't travel far â€” there's basically no chance that a bunt will result in a home run, for example. It forces the fielders to run forward, which can sometimes be an advantage for the team that's at bat. The earliest meaning of <i>bunt</i>, "to strike with the head or horns" is probably an early variation on <i>butt</i>, with the baseball meaning arising in the 19th century.</p></div></div>`;
