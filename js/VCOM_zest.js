If you've got a <i>zest</i> for something, you put your whole heart and soul into it. Dancers who have great <i>zest</i> leap, kick, and soar their way around the stage with a kind of joyful energy.</p><p class="long">Oddly enough, <i>zest</i> can also be the outer peel of a lemon or orange, which chefs scrape into their dishes when they want to add some tartness and tanginess to a recipe. People who live with that same kind of spice are said to have a "<i>zest</i> for life." In other words, they live their lives with a lot of flavor and gusto. A student who has a <i>zest</i> for learning dives into her books with an enjoyment and relish most people reserve for their wedding day.</p></div></div>`;
