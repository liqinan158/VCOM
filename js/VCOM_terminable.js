In law, <i>terminable</i> describes an agreement that can be ended. If you want to pursue a solo singing career, you'd better hope your contract with your band's manager is <i>terminable</i>.</p><p class="long">If an apartment lease is terminable, that means you're allowed to break it or get out of it under certain circumstances. And if the song your little brother sings is terminable, it eventually comes to an endâ€”this sense of the word is less common than its antonym, <i>interminable</i>, "appearing to be infinite." Both words come from the Latin root <i>terminus</i>, "end or limit."</p></div>`;
