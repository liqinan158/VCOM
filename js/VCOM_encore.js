If you're deaf from last night's concert, it might be because the band played for two hours and then did a thirty minute <i>encore</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Encore</i> is a French word meaning again. Audiences often yell, "<i>Encore!</i>" if a play, song, or other act has been particularly good. In essence they are shouting, "Again!" After a musical number, the encore may take the form of a repeated verse or chorus. At the end of a concert, the encore may be a whole extra set. The word is sometimes used sarcastically: "Well, you flunked math. What are you going to do for an <i>encore</i>?"</p></div>`;
