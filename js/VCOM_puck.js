A <i>puck</i> is a round, hard rubber disc.</p><p class="long">Dictionaries hate to resort to "origin uncertain," but a few of them do when it comes to <i>puck</i>, the small rubber disk used in ice hockey. One theory is that it's related to the verb <i>poke</i>, by way of the archaic verb form of <i>puck</i>, "to hit or strike." Its toehold in history got firmer footing 90 years ago, when the National Hockey League was formed. In the 1930's, hockey players were referred to as <i>pucksters</i> in sports reporting lingo.</p></div>`;
