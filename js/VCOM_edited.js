First it gets rearranged, shortened, added to, made more clear, sometimes rewritten. Then it gets edited by a copy editor for factual truth, spelling, consistency, and clarity. A song might get edited for play on the radio, or raw film footage edited for the nightly news. And if you hear a "bleeeeep!" during your favorite talk show, it's likely that a bad word has been edited out.</p></div>`;
