Your great aunt Edna who lashes out at anyone who approaches, convinced they'll steal the jewelry she keeps in her handbag on her lap? A <i>misanthrope</i> indeed.</p><p class="long">This is a formal word, derived from Greek <i>misanthrōpos</i> "hating mankind," from <i>misein</i> "to hate" plus <i>anthrōpos</i> "a man." From the same root, we get the English word <i>anthropology</i> "the study of humans." If you make a statement or do something that is particularly hostile or untrusting, you can call that <i>misanthropic</i>.</p></div></div>`;
