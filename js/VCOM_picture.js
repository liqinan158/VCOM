If your story about your principal and some chickens is descriptive enough, your friends can <i>picture</i> the whole incident.</p><p class="long">A <i>picture</i> is also a piece of art made by painting or drawing, like the pictures by famous artists you see in a museum. In a book, a <i>picture</i> is an illustration that accompanies the text, often in a child's picture book. You can also call a photograph a <i>picture</i>.
