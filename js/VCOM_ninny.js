You might warn your brother not to be a <i>ninny</i> when he's just about to pop an entire hot chile in his mouth.</p><p class="long"><i>Ninny</i> is apt for someone who's silly and stupid, but it's also insulting and should be used with care. There's a certain gentle, teasing quality to <i>ninny</i> (as opposed to a word like <i>idiot</i>), but you're still going to get in trouble if you call your math teacher a ninny for giving the class a pop quiz. The word's origin is a bit of a mystery, though it may come from <i>an innocent</i> or the Italian word for "child," <i>ninno</i>.</p></div></div>`;
