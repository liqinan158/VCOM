Your best friend might be your number one sympathizer, agreeing with your opinions and backing you up when you need support. Key to the noun <i>sympathizer</i> is the verb <i>sympathize</i>, "agree with a sentiment" or "have fellow feeling." Both words come from the Greek <i>sympathes</i>, "affected by like feelings," a combination of <i>syn</i>, "together," and <i>pathos</i>, "feeling."</p></div>`;
