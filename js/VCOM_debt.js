If you get arrested for stealing, serving time in jail is the way to repay your <i>debt</i> to society.</p><p class="long"><i>Debt</i> comes from the Latin word <i>debitum,</i> which means "thing owed." Often, a debt is money that you must repay someone. <i>Debt</i> can also mean the state of owing something â€” if you borrow twenty dollars from your brother, you are in debt to him until you pay him back. If someone says, "I owe you a debt of gratitude," it means you have done something great and that person intends to do something to "repay" your kindness.</p></div></div>`;
