If you bark at cats and meow at dogs, you might suffer from <i>insanity</i>.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>insanity</i> originates from the Latin word <i>insanitatem,</i> meaning "unhealthfulness" relating to the mind. It is believed that master artist Vincent van Gogh, who cut off his ear and gave it to a prostitute, experienced periods of insanity. But this term can also refer to things people perceive as unconventional or foolish, like your neighbor who quit his job, sold all his belongings, and bought a boat to sail around the world.</p></div>`;
