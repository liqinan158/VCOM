To make peanut brittle, bake the ingredients on a cookie sheet then let the brittle cool into sheets which you break into pieces (and then eat — wreaking havoc with your braces). It's ok to use the adjective <i>brittle</i> freely to describe lots of things that will break easily — such as a heart, a theory, or a poorly equipped army.</p></div></div>`;
