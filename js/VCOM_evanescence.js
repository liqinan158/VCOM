Something that possesses qualities of evanescence, has a quality of disappearing or vanishing.  The evanescence of a shooting star makes it hard to catch â€” it's there one moment and gone the next.  Evanescence is a word typically used to describe an event that fades from sight or memory, or sometimes the fleeting quality of worldly success.</p></div>`;
