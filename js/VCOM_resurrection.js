A zombie <i>resurrection</i> may occur in that scary movie you're watching, or a fashion designer may bring about the <i>resurrection</i> of the a-line skirt.</p><p class="long">First used in the 13th century, the noun <i>resurrection</i> comes from the Latin word <i>resurgere</i>, meaning "rise again." It can refer literally to a rising from the dead, but you're more likely to hear the word describe something that's figuratively brought back to life — meaning, it's been revived after a time of inactivity or decline. If a pitcher who has been in a slump throws a perfect game, that could be considered a resurrection of his baseball career.</p></div>`;
