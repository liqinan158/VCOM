When you smock, however, you use a special sewing technique that makes small, decorative pleats or gathers. The Old English root of <i>smock</i> is <i>smoc</i>, "loose-fitting woman's undergarment," which is probably related to the Old English <i>smūgan</i>, "to creep," and the Old Norse <i>smjúga</i>, "to put on or creep into a garment."</p></div>`;
