It's no "but" or "however", <i>though</i> it is a useful word, when you want let a reader know that two ideas are opposing one another.</p><p class="long">There are two basic kinds of the so-called coordinating conjunctions: those that connect similar thoughts — for example, "and" — and those that <i>dis</i>connect similar thoughts — for instance, "but" and "however." <i>Though</i> fits into the second category. For example "<i>Though</i> Prince is considered 'older' by rock-star standards, his concerts put those of most kids half his age to shame." The "<i>though</i>" in that sentence gets its power from the comma at the midpoint, because that's where the two opposing ideas meet. The word <i>Though</i> at the beginning tells us to look for that comma.</p></div>`;
