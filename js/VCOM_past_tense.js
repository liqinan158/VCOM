When you say, "I joined the circus," the verb "joined" is in the <i>past tense</i>.</p><p class="long">When people write or speak using the past tense, they're describing something that happened earlier, whether it was yesterday or ten years ago. If you say, "My favorite food is pizza," the verb "is" is present tense, but if you say, "When I was five, my favorite food was pizza," the verb "was" is past tense. The noun <i>tense</i>, which means "verb form that indicates time of action," comes from the Old French root <i>tens</i>, or "time."</p></div></div>`;
