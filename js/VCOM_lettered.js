People are especially <i>lettered</i> when they've read a lot of books.</p><p class="long">Though you'd never want to describe yourself as <i>lettered</i> — you'd sound like a show off — it's a great way to describe a scholarly friend. Lettered people are well-educated and well-read, and are often academics, either teaching or researching their areas of interest. The origin of <i>lettered</i> is <i>littera</i>, "letter of the alphabet" or "document," and its plural form, <i>litteræ</i>, which means "literature or books."</p></div>`;
