Entire towns can be flooded as well, particularly coastal cities during torrential storms like hurricanes. You can also describe someone's eyes brimming with tears as <i>flooded</i>. The word comes from <i>flood</i>, which has an Old English root, <i>fl≈çd</i>, "tide, deluge, sea, or wave."</p></div></div>`;
