For example, an <i>aftereffect</i> of taking some kinds of allergy medication is feeling very sleepy.</p><p class="long">While many aftereffects can essentially be side effects of taking some drug or medicine, there are many other types of aftereffects. An aftereffect of being rude to a customer at the restaurant where you work might be a very small tip, and the aftereffects of being robbed could include a fear of walking alone at night. The word combines the Old English root <i>Ã¦fter</i>, "after, next, or later," and the Latin <i>effectus</i>, "accomplishment or result."</p></div></div>`;
