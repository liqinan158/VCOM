You can use <i>corduroy</i> to make clothing or to upholster furniture.</p><p class="long">The fabric known as <i>corduroy</i> is most famously used to make the jean-style pants also known as <i>corduroys</i>. The pattern on a piece of corduroy is called a "cord," the ridges that distinguish corduroy from its close relative, velvet. Another kind of corduroy is an often temporary road that's laid with many logs in a row â€” corduroy roads have been used during wars to bridge swampy areas quickly.</p></div></div>`;
