Try <i>expectorate</i>.</p><p class="long">There's no way around it â€” expectorating is pretty gross. If you have a respiratory problem like bronchitis, you're going to expectorate a lot: phlegm and mucus will build up in your lungs, and you'll eventually cough it up and spit it out. A doctor might prescribe a special cough medicine to help you expectorate. Sometimes people use <i>expectorate</i> to mean spitting out plain old saliva, too.</p></div></div>`;
