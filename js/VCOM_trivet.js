Your famous chicken noodle casserole might need to rest on a <i>trivet</i> so you don't burn your kitchen table.</p><p class="long">Anything placed on a table to protect it from a hot pan can be called a <i>trivet</i>. If you forget to use a trivet under a pot of chili, your table might end up with a big scorch mark. The original meaning of <i>trivet</i> was "three-legged stand," especially one used under a cooking pot in a wood stove or over an open fire. It probably comes from the Latin word <i>tripedem</i>, "three-footed," from <i>tri</i>, "three," and <i>pes</i>, "foot."</p></div>`;
