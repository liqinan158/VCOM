var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">conform</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>conform</i> means to adapt to fit in with new conditions. So if you travel to Morocco, you should <i>conform</i> to the local custom and adjust your usual wardrobe to one that is more modest.</p><p class="long">Sometimes <i>conform</i> gets a bad rap, carrying with it the sense of compromising one’s individuality to fit in or please others. But take note that it doesn’t always have to carry such a negative charge. For example, the manager of a factory that produces bouncy balls would want each ball that came off his conveyor belts to conform to a high standard of durability, bounciness, and roundness.</p></div>`;
