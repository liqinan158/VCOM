This scientific word also gets used in unscientific ways, as in "Every single <i>molecule</i> in my body wants that chocolate cupcake!"</p><p class="long">People sometimes confuse molecules with atoms, but a molecule is made up of atoms. A molecule retains the characteristic of the substance itâ€™s from, so a water molecule is still water. An atom only has the characteristics of its element, not the larger composition. For example, a water molecule, H2O, is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.</p></div></div>`;
