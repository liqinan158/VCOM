You, my friend, know how to <i>dissimulate</i> â€” that is, cover up your true feelings. Unless you happen to really, really like socks.</p><p class="long">Sometimes confused with <i>dissimilar,</i> meaning "not alike", or "different," or a form of <i>simulate,</i> meaning "to pretend to do or feel something." Being able to dissimulate is a useful trick, not just if your wife gives you socks. After all, the whole political process depends on it. As Louis XI once said, "He who knows not how to <i>dissimulate</i>, can not reign." Wikipedia would probably agree with that.</p></div>`;
