Don't you wish you had a <i>document</i> saying that the bank owed you $5 million?</p><p class="long"><i>Document</i> comes from the Latin verb meaning "to teach," so a document instructs you with the information it contains. Legal documents such as contracts contain instructions on how the people signing it will act. Passports, driverâ€™s licenses and birth certificates are all official documents. As a verb, <i>document</i> means "to record in detail," or "offer supporting evidence for." If you call a company to complain about something, make sure to document your phone calls by noting the date you called, who you spoke to and what was said.</p></div></div>`;
