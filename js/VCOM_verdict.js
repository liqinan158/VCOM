If you've finally decided that the test was unfair, that's your <i>verdict</i> and you should talk to the teacher about it.</p><p class="long">Although <i>verdicts</i> are usually announced in a courtroom, any time someone makes a judgment about something, it's a <i>verdict</i>. The truth lies in the root of this word: <i>ver</i> comes from the Latin <i>verus</i>, meaning "true." <i>Ver</i> shows up in other words â€” to <i>verify</i> something is to prove that it's true, and <i>veracious</i> is an adjective meaning "truthful."And the truth is exactly what the judge needs when he's trying to decide the verdict of a case.</p></div>`;
