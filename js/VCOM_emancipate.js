At the end of the Civil War, slaves were <i>emancipated</i> and became free men and women.</p><p class="long">If you break down <i>emancipate</i>, you have <i>e-</i> "out," <i>-man-</i> from the Latin <i>manus</i> "hand," and <i>-cip-</i> from the Latin verb "to take." Put it together, and you have "to be taken out of someone's hands" â€” a good definition of freedom. The American Revolution was about colonists emancipating themselves from British rule. As a legal term, if a child is emancipated, he or she is declared independent from parental control.</p></div>`;
