You might also decide to put your giant new TV in the <i>parlor</i>.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>parlor</i> is an old-fashioned one. Still, almost anyone would know what you meant if you invited them to join you in the parlor for tea. These days, a hotel, inn, or historic house is more likely to have a parlor than a private home is. The thirteenth century version, <i>parlur</i>, meant "room in a monastery for holding conversations." The "conversations" part stems from <i>parler</i>, "to speak" in French.</p></div>`;
