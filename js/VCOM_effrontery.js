When a couple stroll into a crowded restaurant, demand the best table, and threaten the staff unless they're seated right away, that's <i>effrontery</i>.</p><p class="long">People have been guilty of outrageously self-centered behavior at least since 1715, when <i>effrontery</i> was coined. Tracing to the French word <i>effront√©</i>, meaning "shameless," the word <i>effrontery</i> is also connected to <i>brazen</i>, which means "of brass," and describes someone so accustomed to effrontery that he's hardened to it and has no concern for the harm done to others.</p></div></div>`;
