Still, it's not unusual for smaller websites to have one person who's in charge of many different aspects of keeping the site functioning and looking good, from design to analyzing traffic to troubleshooting problems. Since this person is in charge of the website, it's appropriate to refer to her as a webmaster.</p></div></div>`;
