It's from the Latin word, well, <i>cadaver</i> (dead body), that comes from another Latin word <i>cadere</i> meaning "to fall." That's some fall! You don't have to be dead to look cadaverous, though, if your cheeks are sunken and your ribs poke through your torn tee-shirt, you look cadaverous and it's not a compliment (unless you're a Goth). On Halloween, you might go for a cadaverous look with green-tinted makeup and black circles under your eyes.</p></div></div>`;
