If you learn that your so-called best friend is spreading nasty rumors about you, act <i>accordingly</i> and stop being her friend.</p><p class="long"><i>Accordingly</i> is the adverb form of <i>accord</i>, which means harmony, or agreement. We often use the phrase "act <i>accordingly</i>," which just means to behave in a logical manner based on what you feel, learn, or are told. If you are half-starved after being lost in the woods for three days, when you come across a house with a full kitchen, you will act accordingly. <i>Accordingly</i> can also mean "therefore." You were hungry, accordingly you ate.</p></div></div>`;
