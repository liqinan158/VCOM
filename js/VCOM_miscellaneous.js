A breakfast bar, a DVD, and a credit card bill are <i>miscellaneous</i> items that may be in your backpack.</p><p class="long">The word <i>miscellaneous</i> comes from the Latin word <i>miscere</i>, meaning “to mix.” You might have heard the expression “a mixed bag,” which applies when you don’t quite know what you’re going to get. That’s true of a bag of miscellaneous objects, too. You might pull out socks and a stick of butter — two things that don’t seem to go together. Similarly, <i>miscellaneous</i> can describe something with many variations, like a person who expresses herself in many different ways.</p></div></div>`;
