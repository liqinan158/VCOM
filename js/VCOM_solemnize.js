You'll know when you wrap your tongue around this one, in which the <i>n</i>, normally silent in <i>solemn</i>, gets to introduce the suffix <i>-ize</i>. Even more fun is the fact that <i>solemnize</i> has a Greek suffix tacked onto a Latin root, <i>sollemnis</i>, or "formal, ceremonial, traditional." But we shouldn't be having so much fun with a verb whose meaning is "perform with dignity or gravity."</p></div></div>`;
