The angles across from each equal side are also the same in an <i>isosceles</i> triangle.</p><p class="long">Mathematicians use the term <i>isosceles</i> in two slightly different ways. The Greek mathematician Euclid defined an isosceles triangle as having exactly (and only) two equal sides. Modern geometry experts tend to say that a triangle is isosceles if at least two sides are equal â€” making an equilateral triangle (with three equal sides) also an isosceles triangle. The Greek root, <i>isoskeles</i>, means "with equal legs."</p></div>`;
