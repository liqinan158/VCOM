That person has a <i>fiduciary</i> duty to take care of the money.</p><p class="long"><i>Fiduciary</i> comes from the Latin word <i>fidere,</i> "to trust." That's because a fiduciary is the person you trust to hold and watch over your assets until it's time for them to go to another designated person. For example, when a child's parents die, someone is chosen to look after the money left in the will until the child is old enough to manage it himself. <i>Fiduciary</i> can either be a noun to refer to the caretaker or an adjective to describe the trust.</p></div>`;
