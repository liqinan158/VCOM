var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">decriminalize</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you take something that's against the law and make it legal, you <i>decriminalize</i> it. If your state rescinds a law requiring motorcycle helmets, they <i>decriminalize</i> riding without a helmet (which still doesn't mean it's a good idea).</p><p class="long">As social norms change, lawmakers and voters may choose to decriminalize activities or behaviors that were once illegal. If the legislature of your states decides that a casino will bring in needed revenue, they might decriminalize gambling. The word <i>decriminalize</i> can also be used when things are still technically against the law, but those laws are no longer enforced: "There's still a leash law, but the city decided to decriminalize off-leash dogs on the beach."</p></div>`;
