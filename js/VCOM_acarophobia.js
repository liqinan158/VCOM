If you suffer from <i>acarophobia</i>, the idea of getting head lice is completely terrifying.</p><p class="long">Most people have a dislike or even disgust for creepy crawly bugs, but when that normal feeling becomes overwhelming and exaggerated, it might be diagnosed as acarophobia. A person with this disorder has a horror of small crawling insects, or even the delusion that his skin is crawling with imaginary bugs. The word is rooted in the Greek <i>akari</i>, "mite or tick," and <i>phobos</i>, "fear or terror."</p></div>`;
