Arsenic and cyanide are both types of <i>poison</i>—so stay away from them! Mean people can also be <i>poison</i>, so stay away from them too.</p><p class="long"><i>Poison</i> refers to the harmful substance itself, or the act of giving it to someone. Poison often shows up in murder mysteries because it’s a sneaky way to get rid of someone. We also use <i>poison</i> metaphorically for things that tend to ruin something. A really obnoxious friend who always insists that he knows more than everyone else might poison the atmosphere at a dinner party. Jealousy can poison a good relationship.</p></div></div>`;
