If you don't tidy up your room, your parents will give you a hard time about its <i>uncleanliness</i>.</p><p class="long">If conditions are generally less than clean, that's uncleanliness. You can use this noun to talk about your friend's filthy car or the family dog after she's been wading in mud: "Sadie's uncleanliness means we're going to have to hose her off before we take her to the vet." <i>Clean</i> is at the heart of <i>uncleanliness</i>, from the Old English root <i>cl√¶ne</i>, "free from dirt or filth."</p></div></div>`;
