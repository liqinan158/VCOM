When you walk through a historic <i>graveyard</i>, you'll see many beautiful old headstones and tombs.</p><p class="long">Other names for a graveyard are "cemetery" and "burial ground." It's slightly more common to use <i>graveyard</i>, a word that dates from about 1683, for the burial site near a church. If you work at a graveyard, you might care for the grave markers and plants. If, on the other hand, you work a <i>graveyard shift</i>, that simply means you work late at night.</p></div>`;
