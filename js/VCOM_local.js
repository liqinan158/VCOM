Something that's local is limited to a specific place, like a particular neighborhood or city. <i>Local</i> also can describe places that aren't, well, places — they're more like areas. For example, a dentist might administer a local anesthetic to numb your mouth when filling a cavity. That means the anesthetic acts only on a specific area of the body.</p></div>`;
