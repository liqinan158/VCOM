In a food fight, you may <i>hurtle</i> chocolate pudding across the room, but be prepared for someone to launch peas at you in retaliation. Duck!</p><p class="long">The verb <i>hurtle</i> also means to move rapidly, often with a rushing sound, and sometimes with seeming lack of control. If you are driving on wet, slippery roads at night, try not to drive fast and skid out of control â€” if you do, your car may seem to hurtle through the darkness! By the way, even though we can't feel it, the earth hurtles through space at approximately 67,000 miles per hour as it orbits the sun.</p></div></div>`;
