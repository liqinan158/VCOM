If they are, it means they are good at problem solving, and this could come in very handy.</p><p class="long">Think of resourceful people as “full of resources,” or tools for coming up with solutions. They adapt well to new or difficult situations and they are able to think creatively. For example, if a snake gets loose in the pet store, a resourceful person will be able to figure out how to lure it back into its cage again.</p></div>`;
