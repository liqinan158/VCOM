var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">tire</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>tire</i> is to grow weary or bored with something. As a noun, a <i>tire</i> is the large, rubber ring that surrounds a car's wheel. You might <i>tire</i> from the hard work of changing a flat <i>tire</i>.</p><p class="long">When you tire, you need rest, or sometimes just a break: "When I tire of working on my homework, I like to read a book or watch TV for a while." As far as etymology goes, the verb is completely unrelated to the noun. The verb comes from an Old English word meaning "to become or make weary." The wheel-covering <i>tire</i>, on the other hand, was originally a shortened form of <i>attire</i>, "clothing or apparel," from the idea that a tire is, in a sense, clothing for a naked wheel.</p></div>`;
