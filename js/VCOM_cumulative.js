var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">cumulative</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The adjective <i>cumulative</i> describes the total amount of something when it's all added together. Eating a single chocolate doughnut is fine, but the <i>cumulative</i> effect of eating them all day is that you'll probably feel sick.</p><p class="long">The origin of <i>cumulative</i> is helpful in remembering the meaning; it comes from the Latin <i>cumulatus</i> for "to heap." If something is cumulative, it is heaped together so it can be counted up to get a total number. The cumulative snowfall for the whole winter isn't just the amount of snow that fell in one month, but rather the number of inches that fell every month that winter to get the total, cumulative, amount.</p></div>`;
