If you declare that from today <i>forth</i>, you'll pursue your dream of becoming a rodeo clown, it means you'll work every day to make it happen.</p><p class="long">The adverb <i>forth</i> describes pushing forward, either literally or in time. When something goes forth, it moves into view or forward. In spring, flowers shoot forth from the ground. You have probably heard the expression <i>and so forth</i>, which like <i>and so on</i> means whatever else. Don't confuse <i>forth</i> with <i>fourth</i>, which sounds the same but means "number four in a series."</p></div></div>`;
