It's fairly easy to grow <i>arugula</i> in a small garden.</p><p class="long">In the US, this plant is usually called <i>arugula</i>, while in the UK it's more often called <i>rocket</i>. Many backyard gardeners like to grow arugula, which is one of the earliest plants to be harvested, since it's fairly tolerant of cold. The Latin name is <i>Eruca sativa</i>, but <i>arugula</i> comes from an Italian dialect's variation on <i>ruchetta</i>, the plant's name in Italy.</p></div></div>`;
