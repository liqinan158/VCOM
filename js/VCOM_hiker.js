Pass the trail mix.</p><p class="long">As opposed to someone who's taking a brief stroll or a long walk in the city, hikers tend to take vigorous, deliberate walks in the countryside. Day hikers may hike empty-handed, wearing sturdy walking shoes, while longer hikes require hikers to carry packs with water, food, a compass, and possibly even camping supplies. <i>Hiker</i> comes from the verb <i>hike</i>, a 19th century word that was originally spelled <i>hyke</i>.</p></div>`;
