Another kind of spot is a small part of something, like the bright spot in your miserable day, or the bald spot on someone’s head. Spot is also shorthand for "spotlight" and slang for money, as in "He handed me a ten <i>spot</i>." To spot something is to see it: "When you <i>spot</i> the ice cream truck, call me!"</p></div></div>`;
