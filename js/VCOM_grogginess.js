Once you get past the initial <i>grogginess</i> of waking up at three in the morning, you'll be excited to head out on your camping trip.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>grogginess</i> comes from <i>grog</i>, an old-fashioned alcoholic drink favored by 18th-century sailors. Grogginess was originally a state of being under the influence of grog â€” tipsy, weak, or dazed. Starting around 1830, boxers started using it to describe the dizzy, shaky state caused by being punched in the head a few times. If you're feeling woozy for any reason, you're experiencing grogginess.</p></div></div>`;
