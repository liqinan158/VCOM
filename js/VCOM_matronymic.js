It was once fairly common for babies to be given the last name of the parent who was considered to be more important (this usually had to do with wealth or a powerful family). King Henry II of England had several surnames, one of which was the matronymic "Fitzempress," or "son of an empress." The word <i>matronymic</i> combines the Latin <i>mƒÅter</i>, "mother," and the Greek <i>onuma</i>, "name."</p></div>`;
