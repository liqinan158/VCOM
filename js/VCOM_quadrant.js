When you bake an apple pie and then cut it equally so that you and three of your friends get pieces that are the same size, you'll each get a <i>quadrant</i> of the pie.</p><p class="long">When a circle is evenly divided into four sections by two perpendicular lines, each of the four areas is a quadrant. In fact, anything that's split into four equal parts can be described as being made up of quadrants, like a quadrant of a public park. The Latin root word is <i>quadrantem</i>, fourth part, and for many years <i>quadrant</i> was used to mean six hours, or one-quarter of a day.</p></div></div>`;
