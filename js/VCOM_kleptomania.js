People with <i>kleptomania</i> can’t help but steal stuff, whether they need it or not.</p><p class="long">The word <i>kleptomania</i> comes from the Greek word <i>kleptes</i> for "thief" and <i>mania</i> for “madness.” Pyro<i>mania</i> makes people want to light everything on fire, and klepto<i>mania</i> makes people want to steal all the time. People who have kleptomania — kleptomaniacs — are crazy about stealing. Rich people can have kleptomania, which shows their stealing isn't for economic reasons. When you have kleptomania, the rush of stealing is similar to the rush of other addictions.</p></div></div>`;
