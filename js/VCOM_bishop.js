In many churches, a <i>bishop</i> ordains, or appoints, ministers and priests.</p><p class="long">In Christian traditions ranging from Roman Catholic to Lutheran, bishops play an important role in church oversight. In many orthodox and Catholic churches, bishops are believed to be the successors to the original twelve apostles from the Bible's New Testament.
