These recipes include <i>prosciutto</i> for its salty, intensely flavorful taste.</p><p class="long">Prosciutto is made from pork. It's a version of ham that's sliced paper-thin after being dry-cured for a very long time, a process that involves salting the meat heavily. When you eat prosciutto, you're actually eating raw meat, since it's aged instead of cooked. The strong, salty flavor lends this Italian delicacy to antipasto plates and pizza toppings. We can trace the word <i>prosciutto</i> back to the Latin <i>exsuctus</i>, "lacking juice" or "dried up."</p></div>`;
