So you might unclasp your seatbelt once the plane has landed, or unclasp your bracelet so that your best friend can try it on. You can also undo another kind of clasp â€” a hug, hold, or embrace: "I missed her so much that I didn't ever want to unclasp my fingers from hers once she came home."</p></div>`;
