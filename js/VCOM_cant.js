Lubber! Arrr!).</p><p class="long">Possible sources for <i>cant</i> exist in both Irish Gaelic and Latin, and the meanings of both are similar: <i>caint</i> is "speech," while <i>cantare</i> is "to sing." In broader English, the word was first used to mock the singing of monks (who makes fun of monks?). As it evolved, <i>cant</i> became the whining of beggars and then the secret language of thieves, and the negative connotations persist in modern usage. Just think of the clichés and catchphrases parroted by politicians during election season!</p></div>`;
