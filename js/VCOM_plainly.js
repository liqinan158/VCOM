But if you live plainly, it means you do things in a simple, non-luxurious way. You can also speak plainly, which either means "using simple words," or "bluntly." Certain religious groups, including Quakers, Amish, and Mennonites, have long been associated with the words <i>plain</i> and <i>plainly</i> because they live, speak, and dress so simply.</p></div>`;
