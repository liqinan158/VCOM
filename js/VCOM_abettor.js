If you drive the getaway car during a bank robbery, you're an <i>abettor</i>.</p><p class="long">If you assist someone else in doing something wrong, offering any kind of support or encouragement, you <i>abet</i> that person. From this verb comes the noun <i>abettor</i>, which is a good word for a criminal's sidekick, or the guy who holds his friend's extra spray paint while she paints graffiti on the wall of a school. The root of this word is the Old French <i>abeter</i>, "to bait or harass with dogs," literally "to cause to bite."</p></div>`;
