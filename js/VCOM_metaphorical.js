People use metaphorical language in everyday speech too, like when you say something like, "My brain is foggy today." <i>Metaphorical</i> comes from the Greek word meaning "a transfer," <i>metaphora</i>, which is itself made up of <i>meta</i>, "over," and <i>pherein</i>, "to carry."</p></div></div>`;
