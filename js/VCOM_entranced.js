An <i>entranced</i> theater-goer might gasp out loud when something scary happens on stage.</p><p class="long">When you're entranced by something, it's got you under its spell. In fact, the earliest definition of the word was "put into a trance" or  "put under a spell," with the roots <i>en-</i>, "put in," and <i>trance</i>, "state of suspense" or "state of insensibility to mundane things," from the Old French word <i>transe</i>, "fear of coming evil." The meaning of <i>entranced</i> has shifted over the years to be more positive â€” more "charmed" than "cursed."</p></div>`;
