Think of the baking <i>powder</i> and cocoa <i>powder</i> you use when you make your famous chocolate layer cake.</p><p class="long">Powder is usually made by grinding a hard material until it's the consistency of flour, fine sand, or light snow â€” in fact, freshly fallen, fluffy snow is often called <i>powder</i>. There's a fine line between a grain and a powder, but generally powders have the characteristic of clumping together, while grains are more loose and separate. When you <i>powder</i> something, you apply powder to it. The Latin root, <i>pulverem</i>, means "dust."</p></div>`;
