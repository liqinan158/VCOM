The smell of a rabbit in the woods might <i>sidetrack</i> your dog from coming when you call him.</p><p class="long">In addition to literally wandering off course, <i>sidetrack</i> can also be used figuratively, when someone gets distracted from a task or focus, like when your text messages sidetrack you from finishing your homework. You can sidetrack a conversation, too, by controlling it and steering it in a new direction: "She always <i>sidetracks</i> the conversation so we end up talking about television."</p></div></div>`;
