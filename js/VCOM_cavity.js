Lucky you.</p><p class="long">Doctors sometimes refer to various internal body parts as cavities, such as the "abdominal cavity," which includes the stomach and other hollow parts of the abdomen. You are more likely to hear the word at the dentist’s office, when she finds a cavity, which is a space in your tooth that's been eaten away by decay. Fun!
