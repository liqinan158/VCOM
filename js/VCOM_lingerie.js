When you go the department store, instead of asking, “Where do you keep the underpants?” you could say, “Will you please direct me to the <i>lingerie</i> department?”</p><p class="long">The noun <i>lingerie</i>, pronounced "lahn-zhuh-RAY" by most Americans, comes from the French word <i>lingerie</i>, which means “things made of linen.” In English, <i>lingerie</i> has a bit of a racy connotation, because if you use this word instead of the more common <i>underwear</i>, you are probably talking about silk and lace — fancy underthings that aren't meant for everyday wear.</p></div>`;
