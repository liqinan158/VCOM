Reserve <i>regal</i> for those instances when the person or thing truly seems like it wants to be the queen, actually is the queen, or looks like it might belong to the queen. My French teacher has a truly <i>regal</i> bearing: she stands stick-straight, with her chin in the air, and acts as though she's the queen and we're her court. A <i>regal</i> attitude from a trembling Chihuahua is the height of irony: that little bugger couldn't rule a cat-box, let alone a whole country.</p></div>`;
