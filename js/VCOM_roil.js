A stormy ocean might <i>roil</i>, or even a restless crowd.</p><p class="long">The word <i>roil</i> is often confused with <i>rile,</i> which has a slightly different meaning. If you roil someone you're stirring them up but not necessarily annoying them. To rile someone is to deliberately provoke or antagonize them. Usually there's no roiling without riling. Muhammad Ali <i>roiled</i> much of America when he refused to be drafted for the Vietnam War.</p></div></div>`;
