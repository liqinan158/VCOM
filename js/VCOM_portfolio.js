A <i>portfolio</i> is usually used to transport important documents, like examples of your graphic design work if you’re an artist.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>portfolio</i> has its roots in the similarly-sounding Latin <i>portafoglio</i> “a case for carrying loose papers.” Notice, within that word, two other words — there’s <i>porta</i>, meaning “carry,” and <i>foglio</i>, meaning “sheet, leaf.” In English, think portable folio, or papers that can be carried. Also, <i>portfolio</i> can refer to the duties of a government official or the collection of investments held by a financial company.</p></div></div>`;
