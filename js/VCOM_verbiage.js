Usually, <i>verbiage</i> means a few too many words — like the excessive <i>verbiage</i> in a legal document.</p><p class="long"><i>Verbiage</i> comes from the 18th-century French <i>verbier,</i> meaning "to chatter." <i>Verbiage</i> can mean just the words being used to communicate, or a bunch of empty words used to obscure communication. Someone long-winded might receive a sarcastic "compliment" about his verbiage, while another speaker might receive genuine applause for intelligent verbiage, or choice of words.</p></div>`;
