Some more commonly used synonyms for <i>ductile</i> are <i>malleable</i>, for both senses of the word, and <i>pliable</i> or <i>flexible</i>, for the literal sense. The word shares the same root as the word <i>duke</i>. If you are a duke, you probably hope your people are ductile, or easy to lead.</p></div>`;
