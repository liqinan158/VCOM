While most people associate this word with crime, let's hope you can think of a better reason to <i>premeditate</i> — like buying groceries before a storm.</p><p class="long">When you meditate, you think deeply. The prefix <i>pre</i>- means “before,” so to <i>premeditate</i> means to think about a situation before you’ve jumped into it. If you’ve ever cooked a meal, you’ve premeditated the ingredients you need to get started. In a courtroom you’ll hear about "<i>premeditated</i> murder," which means the accused killer planned out his crime and it wasn’t a crime of passion. Premeditating can be a good thing, but not when it involves murder.</p></div>`;
