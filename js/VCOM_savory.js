var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">savory</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Something <i>savory</i> is full of flavor, delicious and tasty — usually something that someone has cooked. In the world of cuisine, <i>savory</i> is also often used to mean the opposite of sweet, or salty.</p><p class="long">The easiest way to remember <i>savory</i> is that it rhymes with <i>flavory</i> — which is not a real word, but should be. Interestingly, the word <i>unsavory</i> — which is clearly the opposite of <i>savory</i> — is almost never used to describe food. If some a dish doesn't taste good, it, well, isn't good-tasting. If something is unsavory, then it's probably a person or situation that seems morally questionable. So, save <i>savory</i> for delicious food and save <i>unsavory</i> for things, people and ideas deserving of the adjective.</p></div>`;
