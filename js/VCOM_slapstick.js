Old movies by Laurel and Hardy and the Marx Brothers are good examples of <i>slapstick</i>.</p><p class="long">Imagine the laughs you get with the strategic use of a whoopee cushion, and you'll get a sense of what slapstick is. Pratfalls and other physical comedy are an important element of slapstick, from Buster Keaton films, to "I Love Lucy," to "Home Alone." The word <i>slapstick</i> comes from a theatrical device invented in the 16th centuryâ€”a <i>slap stick</i>, two slats of wood that could be smacked together to mimic the sound of a slap.</p></div>`;
