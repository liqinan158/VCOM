When everything is covered with yellow pollen, many people have fits of <i>sternutation</i>. Hand them tissues. You’ll probably never need this word unless you need extra syllables for haiku about spring.</p><p class="long">Sternutation is caused by some irritant — dust, animal dander, or smoke, for example — inside the nose, which causes a sudden burst of air from your lungs to escape your nose and mouth in a sneeze. The purpose of sternutation is to clear your nasal passages of foreign substances. Interestingly, sternutation is impossible while you're asleep. The Latin root is <i>sternuere</i>, "to sneeze."</p></div>`;
