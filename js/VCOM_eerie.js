If it's <i>eerie</i>, it's sure to make the hair on the back of your neck stand up.</p><p class="long">Back in the 1300s when <i>eerie</i> first came on the scene, it meant "fearful or timid." It took a good 500 years or so before it morphed into the adjective we know today, which now means "causing fear because of strangeness." And the strangeness is key: Something that's eerie isn't just scary. It's mysterious, ghostly, and gives you the creeps. Like dark old castles, misty graveyards and creaky sounds in the middle of the night.</p></div>`;
