The word <i>cavalry,</i> which means soldiers on horseback, comes from the same Latin root. So strictly speaking, a <i>cavalcade</i> is group of people on horseback or in horse-drawn carriages, moving together in some kind of ceremony or parade. But cavalcades can include vehicles or people walking, like the motorcycle cavalcades that sometimes accompany a funeral procession.</p></div></div>`;
