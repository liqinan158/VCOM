Feels good, doesn't it?  When someone tells you how great you are to gain favor, they <i>massage</i> your ego.  Not bad, either.</p><p class="long">The word <i>massage</i> has a mysterious background, possibly coming from the Arabic <i>massa</i>, meaning "to touch," finding its way to 19th Century France by way of Napoleon. Would you accept a foot massage from Napoleon?   Or, it might have worked its way to France from India, where <i>amassar</i> carries the meaning "knead."  The year 1913 saw the first massage parlor, which was really a brothel. Today massage is a recognized form of physical therapy and is, of course, practiced by amateurs too.  A little to the left, please.</p></div></div>`;
