Hormones are part of the endocrine system, which works throughout the body to send signals we need to stay alive and healthy. A hormone is secreted in a pregnant woman when it's time for her baby to be born, for example, and hormones remind us when we need to eat. The Greek root, <i>hormon</i>, means "that which sets in motion."</p></div>`;
