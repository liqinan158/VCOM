And they breathe fire.  Okay, maybe not that last part, but that would be awesome.</p><p class="long">Lizards can be smaller than an inch long, or massive in size and weight — like the Komodo dragon, which can grow over ten feet in length.  A type of lizard called a chameleon can change colors whenever it wants, and the Jesus lizard can walk on water.  Most lizards live in deserts or jungles, however the word <i>lizard</i> comes from the Latin <i>lacertus</i>, which means “sea fish” — perhaps because they look like a monster that crawled out of the ocean.</p></div>`;
