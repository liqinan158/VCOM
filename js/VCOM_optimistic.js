If the chain falls off your rusty old bicycle, a tire goes flat, the frame cracks down the middle, the seat keeps twisting around, and you say, "But look! The little bell still works — I'm sure this bike will be fine," you're being very optimistic, though some might venture to call you "delusional."</p></div></div>`;
