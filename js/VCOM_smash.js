It's important to pay careful attention while you're driving so you don't <i>smash</i> into the car in front of you.</p><p class="long">A running child can smash into her friend and knock her down, and an angry chef can smash a plate by throwing it on the floor. In the latter example, there's the additional meaning of "break into pieces." A <i>smash</i> can be a car accident, but it can also be a "great big success," like a TV series that starts slow but turns out to be a smash. This "hit" meaning dates from 1920s reviews of Broadway plays.</p></div>`;
