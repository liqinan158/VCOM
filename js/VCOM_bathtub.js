Some people like to soak in a <i>bathtub</i> at the end of a long day.</p><p class="long">Many bathtubs are made of ceramic or porcelain, and they're large enough for an adult to lie down in at least partially submerged in water. Some bathrooms have only a bathtub, or only a shower, while others have both. In Britain, it's more common to call a <i>bathtub</i> simply a <i>bath</i>. During Prohibition in 1920s America, "<i>bathtub</i> gin" referred to any kind of home-brewed alcohol, whether it was actually made in a bathtub or not.</p></div>`;
