You can <i>electrify</i> a house by wiring it so the occupants will have lights, or you can <i>electrify</i> a boring party by getting everyone laughing.</p><p class="long">A captivating person might electrify every room she enters. Maybe it’s her laugh, maybe it’s the way she talks with her hands, maybe it’s the zany scarves she wears. Something about her gets everyone going. In a related sense, <i>electrify</i> can also describe what the electrician does to a house — she wires it so that the lights, computers, and television can all be plugged in and operate properly.</p></div></div>`;
