For most people, the field of quantum mechanics is <i>unfathomable</i>.</p><p class="long">Fathoms are seafaring units of measure equaling about six feet. So something that is unfathomable is also immeasurable, especially when it comes to depth. If your sonar isn't bouncing anything back to you, you're dealing with an unfathomable distance. Metaphorically, <i>unfathomable</i> can refer to something that resembles an abyss, some figurative notion that's so deep you can't even measure it.</p></div>`;
