Usually the decision comes after much consideration and research, like when Copernicus made the <i>determination</i> that the earth revolves around the sun. The word has come to mean also grit, gumption, pluck, persistence: "With hard work and <i>determination</i>, they were able finish the school project on time."</p></div>`;
