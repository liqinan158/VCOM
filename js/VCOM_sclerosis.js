A diet that's too high in cholesterol can cause <i>sclerosis</i> of the arteries.</p><p class="long">In many cases of sclerosis, the stiffening of tissue in organs, nerves, or arteries happens when it's gradually replaced with harder connective tissue. One of the most common forms of sclerosis is called multiple sclerosis, or MS. In this disorder, nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain are affected. Eventually patients with multiple sclerosis experience lack of coordination, numbness, and other symptoms. The Greek root is <i>skleros</i>, or "hard."</p></div></div>`;
