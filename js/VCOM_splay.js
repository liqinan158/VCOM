If you collapse on your bed with your arms and legs stretched out, you are <i>splayed</i> out on the bed. Fingers, toes, arms, and legs can all <i>splay</i>. Something that has a splayed shape is called a <i>splay</i>, like an architectural detail around a window or door. <i>Splay</i> comes from the verb <i>display</i>, originally "unfurl, unfold, or spread out."</p></div></div>`;
