If you <i>hardly</i> ever visit your cousins in California, it means you almost never travel to see them.</p><p class="long">If you hardly know your neighbor, you only know him a little bit, and if you hardly understand what your French teacher says, you're only catching every few words she speaks. <i>Hardly</i> can also be used to talk about time: "We can't leave yet â€” the party's <i>hardly</i> started!" <i>Hardly</i> originally had nearly the opposite meaning: "with great exertion or effort." The phrase "not <i>hardly</i>," or "a little," eventually lost the "not" and became the <i>hardly</i> we know today.</p></div></div>`;
