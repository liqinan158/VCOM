var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">bless</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>bless</i> is to offer a holy seal of approval, like when a priest blesses water, making holy water. It’s also what people say when you sneeze: <i>bless</i> you, which is short for “may God <i>bless</i> you.”</p><p class="long">If you go back far enough, the word <i>bless</i> is related to the word <i>blood</i>, because of the blood sprinkled on pagan alters. It moved on to mean “to praise,” and now it’s a little of both (minus the pagans). In religious contexts, things are made holy when they're blessed. Also, people are blessed by good things that happen. People often say things like "I've been <i>blessed</i> with good health.” That means they were lucky to receive such good things.</p></div>`;
