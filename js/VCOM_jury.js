If you get summoned for <i>jury</i> duty and get picked as one of the 12 members of the <i>jury</i>, you’ll help decide if someone is guilty or not.</p><p class="long">A jury is any group that makes a group decision. In the County Fair, the stakes aren't so high — just respect for your baking skills or pig-raising talents. But many juries are convened by courts to decide whether someone is innocent or guilty.
