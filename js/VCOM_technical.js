If you have trouble with your new computer, you might call for <i>technical</i> support, but a <i>technical</i> school teaches you a certain craft, like how to weld.</p><p class="long"><i>Technical</i> comes from the Greek <i>tekhno</i>, which means "art or skill." Anything technical requires both art and skill. If you're an Olympic gymnast, you have technical abilities. You might go to a technical school to learn how to be a chef, a mechanic, or a massage therapist. While being technical can be a positive trait, you don't want to overwhelm someone with technicalities. For example: If you're trying to explain how a car works to a kid and you start talking about manifolds, you're getting too technical.</p></div></div>`;
