A co-worker who cries at the drop of a hat is overly <i>emotional</i>.</p><p class="long">If someone says "Stop being so emotional!" they're telling you to calm down because your feelings are out of control. When you're emotional, you're feeling lots of feelings, or <i>emotions</i>: happy, sad, afraid, lonely, mad. An emotional speech makes you stand up and cheer. An emotional movie tugs on your heartstrings. The opposite of emotional is <i>logical</i>: logical things have more to do with your head, while <i>emotional</i> things are all about your heart.</p></div>`;
