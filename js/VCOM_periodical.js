Periodicals are published with regular lengths of time between issues and are described by that length of time, whether it's daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annual. They may be meant for a general audience like the ones you find on the magazine stand in the airport, or they may be more specialized for readers with specific interests, such as <i>The Journal of the Society for Penguin Appreciation</i> or <i>Window Washer Gazette</i>.</p></div></div>`;
