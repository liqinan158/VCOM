var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">awaken</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>awaken</i> someone is to wake them up. You might <i>awaken</i> your roommate accidentally by practicing your tap dance routine in the kitchen.</p><p class="long">You can awaken another person, and a noise or the smell of pancakes or a scary dream can all awaken you from a deep sleep. You can also use the verb <i>awaken</i> to describe what happens when you wake from sleep: "I <i>awaken</i> every morning with my pillow on the floor." A more figurative way to awaken is to arouse a certain feeling or awareness. For example, a sad movie can awaken melancholy feelings in the most cheerful person.</p></div>`;
