The word is often applied to abstract things such as dreams or goals that are out of reach, but it can also describe people. That desirable person who doesn’t love you back? <i>Unobtainable</i>. It can also describe everyday items that can’t be acquired, like the hottest toy of the year that’s <i>unobtainable</i> because it has sold out in every store.</p></div></div>`;
