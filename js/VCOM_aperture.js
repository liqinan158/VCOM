In that case, an <i>aperture</i> refers specifically to the hole or opening in the lens that lets light through, which you can adjust (with the f-stop) to let in more or less light, resulting in a shallow or deep range of focus. A large aperture means only one tiny point of the photo will be in sharp focus, while a small aperture means that much of the background as well as the foreground will be in focus.</p></div>`;
