Though they are described as feminine, they appear as both male and female, acting as companions or guides for faithful Muslims. Houris are often depicted as beautiful young virgins, and this idea has been transferred to European cultures, in which a <i>houri</i> is simply a "voluptuous woman." The Persian root, <i>huri</i>, means "nymph in Paradise," from the Arabic <i>haura</i>, "beautifully dark-eyed."</p></div>`;
