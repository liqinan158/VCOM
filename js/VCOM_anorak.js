Another word for an <i>anorak</i> is a parka.</p><p class="long">Many anoraks are lined with fur or some other warm, wooly material. Arctic explorers and climbers wear anoraks, as well as Inuits and other native people in very cold regions. Inuits, in fact, invented the anorak for hunting and fishing, from seal and caribou skin coated with fish oil. The Kalaallisut language, from Greenland, used the word <i>anoraq</i>, which became <i>anorak</i> in the 1930s.</p></div>`;
