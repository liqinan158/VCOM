A mild earthquake, for example, might make your chandelier <i>vibrate</i>.</p><p class="long">A hummingbird's wings vibrate, and so does an electric toothbrush. That extremely rapid back-and-forth movement is what happens when something vibrates. Something can also vibrate in a more musical, resonant way â€” the sound of an organ might vibrate through a church, for example. The root is the Latin word <i>vibratus</i>, which means "move quickly to and fro or shake."</p></div>`;
