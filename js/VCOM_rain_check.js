The rain check would get you in to another game in the future. These days, a rain check usually has to do with rescheduling. If youâ€™re sick but have plans to hang out with a friend, you could ask for a rain check. This is a nice way of saying, "I can't do this now, but I will later."</p></div></div>`;
