The word <i>slavery</i> comes from the Latin <i>sclava</i>, meaning “Slavonic captive,” referring to the 9th century slavery of Slavonic people, but it came to mean anyone in captivity, not just Slavs.  To be held captive and unable to pursue your own life is slavery, and it’s worth fighting against.</p></div></div>`;
