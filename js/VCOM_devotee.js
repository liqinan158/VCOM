Others save their love and adoration for Mozart. Either way, they are huge <i>devotees</i> of the musicians they love.</p><p class="long">People are called devotees because they're particularly devoted to something. Be it hot yoga, fluffy cats or chocolate cake, a devotee is an ardent follower. In the traditional sense this word was reserved for the extremely devout, who were devoted to their religion. But these days you can be a devotee of just about anything.</p></div>`;
