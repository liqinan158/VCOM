var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">employ</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>employ</i> means to use something or hire someone to work. You can <i>employ</i> a saw to cut a board or <i>employ</i> a tutor to teach you math. You can even <i>employ</i> your talents in study and activities.</p><p class="long">The Latin source of <i>employ</i> is the word <i>implicāre</i>, which literally means to enfold or be connected with. This ties in with the verb <i>employ</i>, which is transitive and needs a direct object. (You can't just say "I will employ — you have to employ something.) The word also suggests using something for a specific purpose: you can employ someone for a job or find something in which to employ your own interests.</p></div>`;
