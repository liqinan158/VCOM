Your parents might think the articles in your favorite fashion magazine are <i>drivel</i> (but they'll change their tune when you become a famous designer).</p><p class="long">Etymologists suspect <i>drivel</i> comes to us from the Old Norse word <i>draf</i>, meaning "malt dregs." This would make sense, given that <i>drivel</i> is usually talk or writing about as useless as dregs. If you don't prepare for an oral report, the unfortunate result may be that your teacher finds your disorganized ramblings to be pure drivel. <i>Drivel</i> also means to dribble saliva. If a friendly dog licks your hand, leaving it wet and gooey, you can assume he driveled on it.</p></div>`;
