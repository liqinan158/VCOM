If you’ve had a <i>baptism</i>, it probably involved being dipped in water or having water sprinkled on you, lots of proud relatives, and hopefully cake afterwards.</p><p class="long">The word <i>baptism</i> can be traced to the Greek word <i>baptismos</i>, meaning “ceremonial washing.” This cleansing rite typically takes place when you’re a child and is often seen as an initiation into the church. <i>Baptism</i> can be used more broadly to describe other kinds of initiations as well. If you go through a difficult experience on your first day on the job, you could say that was your baptism as a customer service rep.</p></div>`;
