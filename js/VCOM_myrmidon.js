A schoolyard bully often has a <i>myrmidon</i> for a best friend â€” someone who is sure to never point out that it's wrong to hassle other kids.</p><p class="long">To pronounce <i>myrmidon</i> correctly, say "MUR-muh-don." A celebrity who hates it when people challenge her ideas probably has only myrmidons for friends. A myrmidon can also be specifically someone who unquestioningly carries out the violent orders of a boss. The word originated with the Greek <i>Myrmidones</i>, the followers of Achilles during the Trojan War, who were said to have been transformed into men from ants, which in Greek is <i>myrmex</i>.</p></div>`;
