A reveler is easy to spot â€” she's probably laughing or talking loudly. <i>Reveler</i> comes from the verb <i>revel</i>, "to enjoy one's self in a noisy way," from the Old French <i>reveler</i>, also spelled <i>rebeller</i>, "be disorderly, make merry, or be riotous." <i>Reveler</i> shares a Latin root with the word <i>rebel</i>.</p></div></div>`;
