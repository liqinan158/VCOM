var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">heartless</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Someone who's <i>heartless</i> is inconsiderate and insensitive to other people's feelings. It would be <i>heartless</i> to smash a little kid's carefully carved Jack o' lantern.</p><p class="long">A heartless person might respond glibly to a friend's sad story about his sick grandmother, or push a hungry cat out the door on a rainy night. If you're heartless, you're cold and uncaring. Another, older meaning of this adjective is "lacking courage," from the Old English <i>heortleas</i>, "dispirited or dejected." The modern meaning was coined by poet Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1816.</p></div></div>`;
