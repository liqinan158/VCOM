Most little kids <i>look forward</i> to their birthdays, while most aging adults <i>look forward</i> to retirement.</p><p class="long">If someone invites you over for dinner and says, "I <i>look forward</i> to seeing you," it's a slightly formal way for them to say, "I can't wait to see you!" or "I'm so excited about you coming over!" You might look forward to the weekend or look forward to the summer. <i>Forward</i> comes from the Old English word <i>forewearde</i>, which means both "in front" and "toward the future."</p></div>`;
