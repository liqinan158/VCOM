The most common type of <i>pallet</i> is the kind used to move cargo.</p><p class="long">After the earthquake in Haiti, hundreds of pallets of food, medicine, and bottles of fresh water were delivered to Port-au-Prince by air. Many pallets are designed with slots at the bottom to accept a forklift's forks. If you're a talented carpenter, you might be able to turn the wood from a used pallet into a table, a chest of drawers, a tree house, or perhaps a little bed to lie down on after all that hard work.</p></div></div>`;
