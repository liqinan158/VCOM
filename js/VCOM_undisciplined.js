An <i>undisciplined</i> bunch of dogs is nearly impossible to walk down the sidewalk together: they all want to run in different directions, chase squirrels, and bark wildly.</p><p class="long">When you take the word <i>disciplined</i>, "showing control or order," and add <i>un-</i>, or "not," to it, you get <i>undisciplined</i>. This is a great way to describe an out-of-control classroom, an athlete whose explosive anger gets her kicked off the field, or someone who can't manage his own money well, spending an entire paycheck all in one place.</p></div>`;
