var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">congest</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The verb <i>congest</i> means to clog up and become blocked. It is frequently applied to a head cold, when your nose begins to <i>congest</i>. During rush hour the roadways begin to be <i>congested</i>, as they become blocked and vehicles slow down.</p><p class="long">We know that "con-" means "together," and the Latin <i>congestus</i>, which is the source of the word <i>congest</i>, means "collected, heaped up." Something that is <i>congested</i> can certainly be thought of as heaped full of stuff. By 1758, the word had taken on the medical meaning of an "accumulation" — think of your nose during a cold! — and the idea of <i>congest</i> as referring to something "overcrowded" was noted in 1859, giving rise to the idea of overcrowded cities as congested.</p></div></div>`;
