A <i>benefactor</i> does well by supporting (usually financially) a person or a good cause. In the old days, a struggling artist or actor might have been supported by a wealthy <i>benefactor</i>. Now, many struggling artists and actors have to rely on waiting tables and other odd jobs instead.</p></div>`;
