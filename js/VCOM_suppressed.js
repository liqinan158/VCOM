var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">suppressed</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If something is <i>suppressed</i>, it has been kept secret or forcibly restricted. You may hear rumors about a <i>suppressed</i> report on a politician's activities — it's kept secret, so you don't know the facts.</p><p class="long">It doesn't always take an outside force to make something suppressed — you can do it yourself. You might occasionally have a suppressed feeling of rage. (Psychiatrists, who are in the business of bringing such feelings to light, might frown on this.) Sometimes something that's suppressed is also oppressed — that is, harshly put down or brutally controlled, like a suppressed minority group. Both <i>suppressed</i> and <i>oppressed</i> come from the same Latin word, <i>opprimere</i>, meaning "to press against, or crush."</p></div></div>`;
