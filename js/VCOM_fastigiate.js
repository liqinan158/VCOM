Sometimes the upward sloping branches of a <i>fastigiate</i> tree could look like they’re part of a single column.</p><p class="long">The word <i>fastigiate</i> comes from the world of botany. A tree that's fastigiate has branches that point up — they’re erect and almost parallel. This gives fastigiate trees a distinctive look, and some people like to plant them in the yard where they don’t have tons of space but want a tree. A Lombardy poplar and a kind of ginkgo biloba are fastigiate trees. Bushes or even branches can be described as fastigiate too.</p></div></div>`;
