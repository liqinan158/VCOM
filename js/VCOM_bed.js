One of a babysitter's most important tasks is telling kids when it's time to get into their <i>beds</i>.</p><p class="long">The bed you get into at bedtime is different from the garden bed you dig each spring, preparing to plant seeds. Another kind of bed is the one made of straw or hay that's tucked inside a barn and intended for animals to sleep on. A truck also has a bed â€” the open rear part you can fill with goods. To <i>bed</i>, or "<i>bed</i> down," is to put someone to bed or climb into bed yourself.</p></div></div>`;
