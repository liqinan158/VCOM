You might spend Friday night curled up on the couch under an <i>afghan</i> watching old movies on TV.</p><p class="long">Many afghans are made from individual crocheted squares — called "granny squares" — stitched together into one big, multicolored blanket. Other afghans are striped or composed of large blocks of color. The connection of the name <i>afghan</i> with the people or country of Afghanistan is unclear, though some crochet and knitting fans believe that the original afghans, first made in the 1800s, were influenced by multi-colored blankets from that country.</p></div>`;
