No animals involved.</p><p class="long">The medical term <i>serum</i> is used to describe the watery component of blood that's left behind when blood clots or coagulates. The serum of someone who's recovered from a disease is sometimes used to treat patients who fall ill with the same disease. Antibodies in the serum can fight off the virus or bacteria that caused the illness. In Latin, <i>serum</i> means "watery fluid."
