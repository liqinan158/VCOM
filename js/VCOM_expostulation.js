If you have parents, you might be more familiar with the term "lecture," an <i>expostulation</i> on why you should never do the things you actually want to do.</p><p class="long">If you've done any geometry proofs, you know that <i>postulate</i> means to put forward an assumption. <i>Expostulate</i> means to take that assumption away. For instance you might postulate that it's a good idea for you and your friends to drive to the beach in the middle of the night, but your parents might expostulate that it's not safe.</p></div></div>`;
