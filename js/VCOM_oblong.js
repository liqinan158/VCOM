If you stretch a circle until it becomes an oval, you've made it <i>oblong</i>.</p><p class="long">First consider the Latin word <i>longus</i>, which means "long," and the prefix "ob," which refers to some direction. It makes sense, then, that an <i>oblong</i> should be an elongated shape, stretched long in one direction.  It can be used a noun or an adjective.  If your dining room table is an oblong, you're going to need an oblong tablecloth.</p></div></div>`;
