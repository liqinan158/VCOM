Your band's first <i>gig</i> might be playing at a high school prom.</p><p class="long">Performers of various kinds book gigs: they arrange to do a show at a specific place and time. If you're a standup comedian, you might dream of a gig at a big concert hall, but have to be satisfied with gigs in church basements and coffee shops. Sometimes people who do freelance work also refer to jobs as <i>gigs</i>. The word comes from early 20th century jazz slang.</p></div></div>`;
