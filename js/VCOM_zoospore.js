Some types of bacteria and fungi have <i>zoospores</i>, whose mobility helps them reproduce more efficiently.</p><p class="long">For some organisms, like moss, mushrooms, and ferns, tiny spores are the way they reproduce. A zoospore is simply a type of spore that can move around on its own, using its whip-like tail as a propeller. If you take a biology class, you might learn about protozoans and fungi that use zoospores to propagate themselves. This word is formed by adding the prefix <i>zoo-</i>, "animal or living being," to <i>spore</i>, from the Greek <i>spora</i>, or "seed."</p></div></div>`;
