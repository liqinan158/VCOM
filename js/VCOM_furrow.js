Originally, <i>furrows</i> were created in soil for water to flow. Now, its most common meaning is of a deep line or wrinkle on the face, as in a "<i>furrowed</i> brow."</p><p class="long"><i>Furrow</i> is related to the old English word <i>farrow,</i> meaning "to root like a swine," which makes sense, seeing as both acts create trenches in the earth. Sometimes a <i>furrow</i> simply means the impression left by a cart wheel or tire track in the mud. In a non-agricultural sense, a furrow is also simply a slight groove or depression or series of indentations in the surface of any object.</p></div></div>`;
