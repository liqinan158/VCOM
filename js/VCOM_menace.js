Angry rabid dogs, smog clouds, and annoying little brothers are all probable <i>menaces</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>menace</i> works as both a noun and a verb, but it wasn't used to describe threatening or bothersome people until 1936. Before then, common menaces probably included things like the plague, locusts, and roving bands of pirate ships. Today, a bad reputation can menace an otherwise promising career, weeds can menace your garden, and burglars are a menace to society.</p></div></div>`;
