It was only after you dripped <i>globules</i> of paint all over your bedroom floor that you realized you should have used a drop cloth when you painted the ceiling.</p><p class="long">When the word <i>globule</i> first appeared in English during the 17th century, it specifically referred to a tiny round thing, a "little globe or sphere." Its roots go back to the Latin <i>globus</i>, "round mass or ball." These days it's perfectly acceptable to talk about a globule of anything that's dripping or forming a small, blobby mass, like the globules of oatmeal in the hair of an enthusiastic baby at breakfast.</p></div>`;
