When the verb <i>fend</i> is used this way, it is almost always followed by "for oneself" or "for himself" or "for herself," and it's been in use since the 1600's. It originated as a shortened form of the verb <i>defend</i>, from the Latin root <i>defendere</i>, "to ward off, protect, or guard."</p></div>`;
