You might enjoy <i>soulful</i> poetry â€” or you might just find it corny.</p><p class="long">If you meet a sad-looking dog with big, soulful eyes at your local animal shelter, you'll have a hard time not taking him home with you. Those soulful eyes might seem to be saying, "You are the companion I've been waiting for all my life." (Although they might actually be saying, "Mmm, you smell like bacon.") This adjective is also good for describing music that moves you deeply.</p></div>`;
