The <i>latter</i> was the son of the former.</p><p class="long">The word <i>latter</i> is really a form of <i>later</i> meaning "more recent" or "that which came after." The latter recording of a band refers to the one made more recently. It also can refer to a later time, near the end. If someone is in the latter stages of a disease, the disease has just about run its course and the person is about to die.</p></div>`;
