If you're craving cannoli, a visit to Chinatown doesn't make much sense, since cheese is more characteristic of Italian <i>cuisine</i>.</p><p class="long">Boiling an egg or flipping burgers on the grill is cooking. But if you want to create cuisine, you need to understand how to prepare the culinary specialties of a particular country or culture.

When the word "fine" is attached to <i>cuisine</i>, it describes the food at a fancy restaurant that will part you with a good portion of your money.</p></div>`;
