It is divided into three sections, the lowest of which is the troposphere. Our planet's weather is largely caused by whatever happens in the troposphere, which is known by scientists for its turbulent movement. The word <i>troposphere</i> comes from the Greek root <i>tropos</i>, "a turn or change."</p></div>`;
