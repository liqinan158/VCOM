You might also need to defrost your icy windshield in the winter before you can drive your car. The word <i>defrost</i> comes from the Old English <i>forst</i> â€” before the 15th century, the words <i>forst</i> and <i>frost</i> were used interchangeably. When it's combined with <i>de-</i>, "off, away, or undo," it means "free of ice or frost."</p></div></div>`;
