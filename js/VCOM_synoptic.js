So something that is <i>synoptic</i> pulls everything together. At the end of a long day touring your great aunt’s ancestral home, hearing endless stories about every dinner party she ever gave and all the people that ever stayed there, you might <i>synoptically</i> comment, “Basically she cooks well and has lots of fancy friends.”</p></div></div>`;
