One of the most famous <i>molls</i> was Bonnie Parker, of the criminal duo Bonnie and Clyde.</p><p class="long">The informal <i>moll</i> has most often been used for the romantic partners of 1920s and 30s mobsters, like Al Capone's wife Mae or George "Baby Face" Nelson's girlfriend Helen. These supportive women were also called "gun <i>molls</i>," not named after the weapon, but for <i>gonif</i>, the Yiddish word for "thief." <i>Moll</i> is a shortened form of the name <i>Molly</i>, long a synonym for "woman of ill repute," for unknown reasons.</p></div></div>`;
