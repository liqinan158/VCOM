You may have heard the saying "hope for the best but expect the worst." Well, it you get the worst, you know there is nothing more bad than that. If you are at your worst, you have never before felt or performed this poorly. Don't confuse <i>worst</i> with <i>worse</i>, which compares only two things. Your cold might be worse than your brother's but dad's is the worst of all.</p></div>`;
