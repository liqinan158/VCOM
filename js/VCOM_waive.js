If you <i>waive</i> your right to help name your family's new puppy, you can't complain if he ends up being called "Mr. Tinkerbell Sweetheart Lovey-Face."</p><p class="long"><i>Waive</i> comes from a Middle English word meaning to abandon; the word <i>waif</i>, which refers to a neglected or orphaned child, shares the same root. However, while abandoning a child on a street corner is not okay, waiving one's right to do something is in most cases perfectly acceptable.  A document stating one's decision to give up one's rights is appropriately called a waiver.</p></div>`;
