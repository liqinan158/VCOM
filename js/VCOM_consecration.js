For example, someone entering the priesthood goes through a <i>consecration</i> rite that establishes his holy commitment.</p><p class="long">If we go to the root of <i>consecration</i>, we find the Latin noun <i>sacer</i>, or "sacred." Add the prefix <i>con</i>, meaning "with," and you can figure out that the verb <i>consecrare</i> means "to do with sacred dedication." In time, the word also came to mean any religious or secular action or dedication that indicated a strong commitment to some purpose, as in “He approached his job with the <i>consecration</i> of a religious zealot.”</p></div></div>`;
