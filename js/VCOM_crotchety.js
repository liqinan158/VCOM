If you're <i>crotchety</i>, you complain and argue and are more or less miserable to be around.</p><p class="long"><i>Crotchety</i> is most often used when talking about older people, like the crotchety old man who sits on his porch and yells at you to slow down when you drive by. Sometimes crotchety people take pleasure in bothering others or complaining. <i>Crotchety</i> derives from the word <i>crotchet</i>, meaning "whim or fancy," and crotchety people do seem subject to whims â€” you might not know exactly why they're irritable, but you definitely know they're crotchety.</p></div>`;
