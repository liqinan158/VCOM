Clay (or Play-Doh) is the best example of something with high malleability; it can be sculpted into almost anything, so it's very malleable. A cinder block has no malleability at all; it can't be shaped into anything. Wet cement has great malleability, unlike dry cement. A person could also express malleability, if he or she is wishy-washy and can easily be molded by others.</p></div></div>`;
