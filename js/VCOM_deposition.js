A <i>deposition</i> can be made outside of court, too — after a crime, a witness might give a <i>deposition</i>. Then that written or recorded <i>deposition</i> can be used as evidence in the courtroom.</p><p class="long">The word <i>deposition</i> is often used in a legal context, but a deposition can also be more like a <i>deposit</i>, as in the deposition of sediment on the bottom of a lake. And in the sense of <i>depose</i>, a deposition can refer to getting rid of a person of authority. The deposition of a king is the same thing as a dethronement. <i>Deposition</i> is a busy word, but it’s most often used in court.</p></div>`;
