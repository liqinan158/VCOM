The adjective <i>sown</i> is the past participle of <i>sow</i>, so you could say, "The field behind the school was <i>sown</i> with wildflower seeds," or "There were so many seeds that couldn't be <i>sown</i> this year because of the drought." The word comes from the Old English <i>sƒÅwan</i>, "to scatter seed upon the ground."</p></div>`;
