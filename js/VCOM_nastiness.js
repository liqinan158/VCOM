When you complain angrily about your meal at a restaurant, your <i>nastiness</i> isn't likely to help you get better food or service.</p><p class="long">Nastiness in people is generally unpleasant and malicious. You might be disgusted by the nastiness of a political campaign, or alarmed by the nastiness of most comments on a newspaper's website. The nastiness of a place, on the other hand, is characterized by filth and squalor: "The apartment's <i>nastiness</i> was captured in the flies buzzing around the kitchen trash can." You could also talk about the weather's nastiness on a bitterly cold, rainy day.</p></div>`;
