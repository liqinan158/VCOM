When musicians are first learning an instrument, they often practice <i>arpeggios</i>.</p><p class="long">String instruments commonly play arpeggios, especially violins and violas. You can also play an arpeggio on a banjo, bass guitar, or a keyboard instrument like a piano. It's also possible to sing an arpeggio, emphasizing each individual note. The word is Italian, from <i>arpeggiare</i>, "to play upon the harp," and ultimately from <i>arpa</i>, or "harp."</p></div></div>`;
