It's shockingly, horrifyingly unpleasant â€” so gruesome and grisly that it makes you want to puke.</p><p class="long">An adjective used to describe that which inspires visions of death and feelings of revulsion, <i>ghastly</i> originated circa 1300. It is very close in meaning to the similarly spelled <i>ghostly</i>. In fact, the word in Old English was originally spelled <i>gastli</i>. But over the years, people confused <i>gastli</i> with <i>ghost</i>, began to adopt the gh- spelling. But don't you forget the "h" - that would be a ghastly spelling error on your part.</p></div></div>`;
