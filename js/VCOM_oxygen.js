Still, oxygen is everywhere—it’s the third most common element on earth. Usually, the word is used in scientific contexts. Still, when someone has a big personality and likes to be the center of attention, we say, they "take all the oxygen out of the room." That means they are a blowhard and attention hog. If they really took your oxygen, you’d be dead.</p></div>`;
