If your online magazine has a <i>readership</i> of five, and one of them is your mom, it's not a roaring success.</p><p class="long">A newspaper, website, or author's readership is their audience â€” it's the group of people who regularly read their publication. The local zine writer might have a readership in the dozens, while the Harry Potter books have a vast readership, numbering in the millions.
