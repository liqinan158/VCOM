The police might <i>impound</i> your car if you were parked in front of a fire hydrant.</p><p class="long">Sometimes a city will impound a driver's car after they've accumulated many unpaid parking tickets. Another reason to impound someone's vehicle is because they haven't been making their loan payments â€” in a case like this, the bank that holds the loan might impound the car.
