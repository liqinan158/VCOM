Both the word <i>parapraxis</i> — from the Latin <i>para-</i>, "contrary," and the Greek <i>praxis</i>, "a doing," — and the term <i>Freudian slip</i> arose from the theories of Sigmund Freud, who invented psychoanalysis. Freud himself first called these slips <i>Fehlleistungen</i>, "faulty actions" in German.</p></div>`;
