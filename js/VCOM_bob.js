A lobster buoy <i>bobs</i> in the ocean, marking the spot where a lobsterman's trap is set.</p><p class="long">Your friend stands out when her red hat bobs among a crowd of people, and so does a red boat as it bobs on a lake. You might bob your head to indicate agreement or get a short haircut that's also called a <i>bob</i>. The motion <i>bob</i> comes from the Old English <i>bobben</i>, "to strike," while the hair style stems from the earlier <i>bobbe</i>, or "cluster," and first referred a trimmed horse's tail.</p></div>`;
