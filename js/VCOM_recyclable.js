Glass bottles and paper are <i>recyclable</i>. Styrofoam and unicorns are not.</p><p class="long">Recycling happens when things like old paper, plastic food containers, and metal cans are turned into something new. Recyclable paper, for example, might find a new life as a cardboard box, and recyclable soda bottles might be transformed into plastic benches and tables. Not everything is recyclable, and people who care about reducing consumption and pollution will often make sure they're buying food and other goods in recyclable containers.</p></div>`;
