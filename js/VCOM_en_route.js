If you want to get a milkshake on your way home from work, you might suggest, "Let's stop at the ice cream shop <i>en route</i>!"</p><p class="long">You can use <i>en route</i> when you've embarked on a trip: "My train has left, and I'm <i>en route</i> to Milwaukee." Since it's a French phrase, <i>en route</i> is a sophisticated way to express the fact that you've set off or that you're on your way. The correct pronunciation sounds like "on root."</p></div>`;
