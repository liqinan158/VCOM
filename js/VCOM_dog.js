Animal names are really old words, and <i>dog</i> is old enough that no one knows where it's from. We also call ugly ladies and rotten gentlemen "dogs," so be careful not to call someone "a dog" when you mean, "what up, dog." It's also a verb: to dog (or to hound) someone is to follow them around relentlessly.</p></div></div>`;
