You might refer to the kids you babysit as a bunch of <i>hellions</i> if they regularly refuse to go to bed, instead staging massive pillow fights.</p><p class="long"><i>Hellion</i> almost always describes a young person, often a child, who raises a ruckus or makes trouble in some rowdy way. The little boy next door might have most people fooled into thinking he's an angel, but you'll know he's a hellion when you spot him jumping off the roof into a pile of snow or putting firecrackers in your mailbox. <i>Hellion</i> is an American word, inspired by the Scottish <i>hallion</i>, or "scamp."</p></div>`;
