If you lose weight because you moved and must walk further to school, the weight loss was <i>incidental</i> to the move.</p><p class="long">When something is <i>incidental</i>, it is never the main thing. It's okay to include incidental details as they can add depth to your storytelling, but they are never crucial to the story. A company might pay your main expenses when you travel for business but will probably not reimburse you for the incidental ones. The music you hear between acts of a play is called incidental. It's not crucial to the action, but it makes the waiting easier.</p></div></div>`;
