If you’re drawing your map to scale, taking into account every little hill and valley, you can appreciate the challenge of <i>cartography,</i> the science of making maps.</p><p class="long">You may think cartography has gone the way of the dodo bird, now that we’ve got Google maps and GPS devices. You don’t have to draw maps by hand anymore, but you still need cartography skills to turn digital representations into something people can use with ease. While the word <i>cartography</i> dates only from the mid-19th century, maps were around for a long, long time before that.  <i>Cartography</i> comes from the French <i>carte,</i> “map,” and <i>-graphie,</i> “writing.”</p></div></div>`;
