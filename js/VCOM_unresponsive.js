var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">unresponsive</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If someone can't or won't respond, we call them <i>unresponsive</i>. Depending on the context, a person's unresponsiveness can be just a bummer or a life-threatening condition.</p><p class="long">Take this word piece by piece. <i>Un-</i> means "not," as usual. A <i>response</i> is a reaction to something. And <i>-ive</i> is a suffix that means "state of being." Taken together, these parts add up to "the state of being not responsive." When your boyfriend just sits and stares rather than talking about what's bothering him, he's being unresponsive. Medically speaking, when a person is called <i>unresponsive</i>, it means they're at least unconscious, and possibly dead or dying.</p></div></div>`;
