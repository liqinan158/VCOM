If someone says you did a great job and you say, "It was nothing," that's self-effacing. It is usually considered a positive quality, since it's the opposite of being cocky, egotistical, and attention-hogging. The root of <i>effacing</i> is the Old French word <i>esfacier</i>, which means "to wipe out or destroy," literally "to remove the face."</p></div>`;
