Both are <i>abrasive</i>. Anything that grates or irritates — physically or metaphorically — can be described using this adjective.</p><p class="long">The history of the word <i>abrasive</i> illustrates how a word typically enters the English language and then changes with time.  The English verb <i>abrade</i>, "to wear down by scraping," entered the language from Latin <i>abradere</i>, "to scrape off," in the late 1600s. Some 200 years later, the adjective form of the word — <i>abrasive</i> — came into use to describe a type of grinding tool. By the 1920s, <i>abrasive</i> had acquired the more figurative sense of annoying and infuriating. If you find someone abrasive, he or she grinds away at your nerves.</p></div></div>`;
