Those are <i>gnomes</i>, imaginary characters popular in fairy tales and folklore. For some reason, they’ve lately become popular as garden statuary.</p><p class="long">The <i>gnome</i>, a dwarf-like inhabitant of the earth, has long captured the imagination of children and adults alike — witness the popularity of gnome statues in gardens. Appropriately, the word <i>gnome</i> is perhaps (just perhaps!) from <i>gēnomos</i>, an unrecorded Greek word for "earth-dweller." Credit for the word is given to 16th-century Swiss alchemist Paracelsus. The red-capped creatures entered German and Swiss folklore, and in the 19th century became part of children's literature, usually serving as the guardians of various treasures.</p></div>`;
