Consider the French origins of <i>grandeur</i> as a clue and note that this is a fancy word, best saved for describing things that are truly magnificent on a large scale. The simple beauty of a shadow’s pattern on a sidewalk probably doesn’t have grandeur, but a sunset over the Rocky Mountains probably does.</p></div></div>`;
