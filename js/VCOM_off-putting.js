A waiter's bad breath might be <i>off-putting</i>, and the high prices on the menu might be equally <i>off-putting</i>.</p><p class="long">Off-putting things can seem unappealing, irritating, or downright horrifying. An off-putting movie trailer won't tempt you to see the film and an off-putting list of rules might keep you from signing up for a gym membership. In the sixteenth century, <i>off-putting</i> had a completely different meaning â€” basically "putting off," or "procrastinating." It wasn't until the late 1800s that it came to mean "creating an unfavorable impression."</p></div></div>`;
