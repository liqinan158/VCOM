The word is an example of a <i>postpositive</i> adjective, which means it comes after the word it describes.  So when you go to a circus and 700 clowns surround you, don’t say “There are galore clowns,” because the correct way to express your terror is this: “There are clowns galore. Help!”</p></div>`;
