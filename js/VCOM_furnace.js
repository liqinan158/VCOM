Your <i>furnace</i> might rumble in the basement, sending heat up through your house's radiators.</p><p class="long">Most houses in cold climates have a furnace, to warm their rooms during the chilly months of the year. Furnaces also have industrial uses, like burning trash or extracting ore from metal. If someone says, "It's as hot as a <i>furnace</i> in this classroom!" they mean that it's extremely hot. <i>Furnace</i> comes from the Old French <i>fornaise</i>, "oven," with the Latin root word <i>fornacem</i>, "oven or kiln."</p></div>`;
