Blood is scarlet, and so are rubies and ripe cherries and some brilliant red roses. You can also use <i>scarlet</i> as a noun, to talk about the color itself: "My favorite painter uses a lot of <i>scarlet</i>." In the mid-13th century, <i>scarlet</i> simply meant "rich cloth," which might have been the color scarlet or some other color entirely.</p></div></div>`;
