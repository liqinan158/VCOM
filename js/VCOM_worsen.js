So if the rain that started as a misty drizzle begins to grow torrential, threatening to ruin the picnic you've planned, the weather worsens. And if there's less money in your piggy bank every day, your financial situation worsens. The verb <i>worsen</i> shares a root with <i>war</i>, the Old Saxon <i>werran</i>, meaning "to entangle."</p></div></div>`;
