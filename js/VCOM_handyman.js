If you need help unclogging a drain and repairing a hole in a window screen, you should call a <i>handyman</i>.</p><p class="long">A handyman knows how to do minor repairs and odd jobs, and either tackles these on weekends in his own home or advertises his skills and is employed by other people. These days, it's not uncommon to use the word <i>handyperson</i> instead, since it includes both men and women who are handy at fixing and building things. In any case, a handyman or handyperson doesn't specialize in one skill, but dabbles in many.</p></div>`;
