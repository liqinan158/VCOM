var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">twilight</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The time just after sunset, when the light is half-faded, but the world is not yet totally dark, is <i>twilight</i>. If you are between two states, like asleep and awake, that can also be called a <i>twilight</i> moment.</p><p class="long"><i>Twilight</i> comes just before the night falls. The early light, just before sunrise, is also technically called "twilight" but most people call it "dawn." The prefix <i>twi-</i> might be a clue that twilight happens twice a day, or it could mean "half," as in the half-light of this time. Something that is declining can be described as twilight â€” like the twilight of the trend of wearing plastic clogs favored by nurses and chefs.</p></div>`;
