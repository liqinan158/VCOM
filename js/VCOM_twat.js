Either way, this is a very vulgar, obscene word that should be avoided.</p><p class="long">You don't hear <i>twat</i> as often as some other four-letter words, but that doesn't mean it isn't offensive. Calling someone a <i>twat</i> is a very dirty way of calling them an idiot, jackass, or bozo. If you refer to a woman's genitals as a <i>twat</i>, that might be even more offensive. So unless you want to get punched in the face or sent to the principal's office, just don't say it.</p></div></div>`;
