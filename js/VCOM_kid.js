Sometimes the word <i>kid</i> means a kind of soft leather made from goat skin. When <i>kid</i> is used as a verb, it means to tease or jokingly deceive someone â€” to kid them. Some sticklers for formality object to using <i>kid</i> to mean "child," but that meaning has been around since the 1590s. The "teasing" definition of <i>kid</i> comes from the sense of "treat like a child."</p></div></div>`;
