Go figure.</p><p class="long">Not to be confused with the strut-prone feline likely found licking itself clean under radiators, <i>qat</i> is a social drug that comes from the shrub Catha that grows high in Middle Eastern and African countries. It contains amphetamine that can make you hyperactive, manic, or anxious. Just like caffeine, qat can be addictive, but it's a heck of a Scrabble word. A "q" word without a "u" following it!</p></div>`;
