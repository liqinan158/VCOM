The word derives from the Latin <i>regis,</i> meaning "king," and the ancient French <i>cide</i>, meaning "killer."  Today, the word <i>regicide</i> can also be applied to politicians who topple a president or prime minister.</p><p class="long">People had been killing kings and queens (think Cleopatra) long before the term <i>regicide</i> really took off, which was after the execution of King Charles I in England in 1649. He was executed by guillotine, but a far worse fate awaited those who had signed off on his killing: they were hung, drawn, and quartered. Dangerous profession, regicide.</p></div>`;
