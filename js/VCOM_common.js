It's common for people to put ketchup on their French fries, and a pigeon is an extremely common type of bird to see in a city. <i>Common</i> can also refer to something that's shared by a group, like a region's common culture. In fact, a green space in the center of a town is sometimes called a common, maybe because it's shared by everyone in the town.</p></div>`;
