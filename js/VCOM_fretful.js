You might be <i>fretful</i> — upset and fidgety — if you're waiting to hear whether or not you've been accepted into a competitive summer music program.</p><p class="long">You may be fretful because you're worried about a friend, you're waiting for news, you're incredibly irritated with your little brother, or simply because you're an anxious and restless person. The word at the heart of <i>fretful</i> is fret, a verb meaning "worry" which is rooted in the Old English <i>fretan</i>, "to eat or devour." From this, <i>fret</i> grew to mean "being eaten away by worry."</p></div>`;
