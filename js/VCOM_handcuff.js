When police arrest a suspect, they often put <i>handcuffs</i> on him.</p><p class="long">You'll almost always find this word in its plural form, since handcuffs come in pairs, one for each wrist. It's also a verb, meaning "to put <i>handcuffs</i> on a person." Police officers carry handcuffs with them, so that they're ready to handcuff criminals and troublemakers. Handcuffs hold the wrists close to each other, usually behind the wearer's back. The earliest meaning of <i>handcuff</i> was "decorative sleeve," in the 1640s.</p></div>`;
