As a verb, <i>sparkle</i> means to be lively and excited, or to be so brilliant at something that you shine above the rest. It can also describe something bubbly or foamy — like when you add soap to your bath to make the bathwater sparkle. <i>Sparkle</i> can also describe something that produces sparks — like a magic wand.</p></div></div>`;
