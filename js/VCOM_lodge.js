If you’re in need of a night’s sleep while traveling an out of the way country road, you’re more likely to find yourself at a <i>lodge</i> than a fancy or chain hotel.</p><p class="long">A <i>lodge</i> can also be a cabin in the woods; like an inn, it’s usually a temporary accommodation. But if you join your local lodge, you’ll be expected to be a regular visitor, at least at the monthly meetings. <i>Lodge</i> is also a verb, meaning to stay temporarily, or to give someone a place to stay. If you lodge a toothpick between your teeth, though, you’ll probably hope it won’t stay there too long.</p></div></div>`;
