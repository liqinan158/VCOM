Despite its huge body, the <i>brontosaurus</i> was an herbivore and had a small head and jaw set on a very long neck that was balanced by a long, thin tail.</p><p class="long">For over a century, paleontologists thought the brontosaurus was actually just another apatosaurus, a similar dinosaur that had already been discovered. But in 2015, scientists took another look, and now the brontosaurus is back! The brontosaurus lived in North America in the Jurassic period. Its scientific name comes from Greek roots <i>bronte</i> and <i>saurus</i>, meaning "thunder lizard," which is more fun than <i>apato</i> plus <i>saurus</i>, which means “deceptive lizard.”</p></div></div>`;
