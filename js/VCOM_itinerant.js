It might remind you of <i>itinerary</i>, the traveler's schedule that lists flights, hotel check-in times, and other plans. It's no surprise that both words come from the Latin word <i>itinerare</i>, meaning "to travel." <i>Itinerant</i> was first used in the 16th century to describe circuit judges who traveled to faraway courtrooms. Today, almost anyone can be an itinerant.</p></div>`;
