The <i>disunion</i> of your book group means all the members have gone their separate ways.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>disunion</i> means the coming apart of some connection or alliance, and because it's such a formal word it's often used to talk about governments or business federations. You could say that the disunion of Britain and India resulted in Partition, or that the US Civil War nearly ended in disunion. The word combines <i>dis</i>, "lack or not," and <i>union</i>, with its Latin root of <i>unionem</i>, "oneness or unity."</p></div>`;
