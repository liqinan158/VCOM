The <i>kelvin</i> scale is based on absolute zero, the coldest possible measurement, so there is no such thing as a negative temperature in <i>kelvins</i>.</p><p class="long">The Celsius scale is based on kelvins, but the two scales differ in that kelvins measure an absolute temperature, based on a zero that can literally not get any colder. While temperature isn't commonly measured in kelvins outside the science lab, it's a vital way of calculating temperature for scientists. The kelvin is named after the Irish-Scottish physicist Sir William Thompson, also known as Lord Kelvin.</p></div></div>`;
