If you're quite sure the charity of others pales in comparison with yours, you might be <i>self-righteous</i>.</p><p class="long">Join the Old English words <i>self,</i> meaning "one's own person," and <i>rightwise,</i> meaning "virtuous," and you've got somebody who thinks very highly of their own morality. A self-righteous person thinks they can do no wrong, and goes about with a "holier-than-thou" attitude, judging and scrutinizing everyone else. A fur designer may view PETA activists as self-righteous when they picket his fashion show. You may consider a friend self-righteous when it comes to musical taste.</p></div></div>`;
