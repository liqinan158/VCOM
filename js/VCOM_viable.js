A <i>viable</i> seed can develop into a plant, while a <i>viable</i> company has the resources to succeed.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>viable</i> refers to something able to function properly and even grow. It is made up of the Latin root <i>vita</i>, which means "life," and the ending <i>-able</i>, which means "to be possible." In terms of science or botany, when a plant is viable it can live and flourish in an environment such as a cactus in the desert. Consider also the Wright brothers, who were the first to develop a viable airplane after many tries and spectacular failures.</p></div>`;
