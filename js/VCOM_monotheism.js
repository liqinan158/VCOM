Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are widely practiced forms of <i>monotheism</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Monotheism</i> comes from the combination of the Greek prefixes <i>monos-</i>, “alone” or “single,” and <i>theo-</i>, “god.” There are many words that come from the Greek base <i>theo-</i>: <i>theology</i>, <i>polytheist</i>, and <i>atheism</i>, to name a few.  All of these <i>theo-</i> words have to do with god, gods, or the study of religion. <i>Monotheism</i> is any religion that believes in one god. Buddhism, for instance, isn’t an example of <i>monotheism</i> because Buddha is not considered a god who created the universe.</p></div></div>`;
