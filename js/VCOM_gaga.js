If your sister is <i>gaga</i> for peanut butter while you can't stand it, you should go through your Halloween candy and give her all your peanut butter cups.</p><p class="long">Use the informal <i>gaga</i> for anything you're absolutely wild about, whether you're gaga for kittens or gaga for the beach. It's also used in a somewhat derogatory way to mean "eccentric" or "batty." That quirky old man next door may seem gaga, but once you get to know him you'll realize you've got a lot in common â€” you're both gaga for chocolate!</p></div>`;
