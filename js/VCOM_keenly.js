If you're <i>keenly</i> aware that your sister is grouchy in the morning, you'll steer clear of her until lunch time.</p><p class="long">Sometimes <i>keenly</i> means "enthusiastically," like when you keenly anticipate the next installment in your favorite science fiction book series. In the U.S., it's more commonly used to describe a profound kind of intensity. A movie character might be keenly desperate; your friend may demonstrate how keenly intelligent she is during her debate; or you may keenly regret telling your grandmother what you really thought of her new tattoo.</p></div></div>`;
