If your car is <i>usable</i>, it's running just fine.</p><p class="long">A usable tent has all of its poles and is more or less waterproof, and a usable pair of shoes fits well and doesn't have holes. Describing something as <i>usable</i> can sometimes be faint praise: "Well, this basketball is <i>usable</i>, but just barely." When information is described as usable, it usually means it's actively available, and not just stored in a computer, for example. This is a relatively new adjective, first appearing around 1840.</p></div></div>`;
