You might try to speak with <i>gravitas</i>, but no one will take you seriously if you're wearing clown makeup and giant floppy shoes.</p><p class="long"><i>Gravitas</i> is a Latin word that means "weight or heaviness." It came to mean a figurative weight after <i>gravity</i> acquired a primarily scientific meaning. A biography of Abraham Lincoln will inevitably be full of gravitas, and places like libraries, museums, and university buildings seem to have gravitas, or dignity â€” while grocery stores and gyms usually do not.</p></div>`;
