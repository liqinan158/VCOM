It's tempting to skip school and spend the afternoon at the beach, but it's wiser to avoid the temptation. People commonly describe food they feel is bad for them as <i>tempting</i>. This sense of something that's both harmful and attractive comes from the original meaning of <i>tempt</i>, "entice to evil or sin."</p></div></div>`;
