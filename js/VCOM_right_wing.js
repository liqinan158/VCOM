A <i>right wing</i> priority might be reducing the size of government, for example, or opposing gun control measures.</p><p class="long">A right wing candidate is conservative, often (but not always) a member of the Republican Party in the U.S. At the opposite end of the spectrum are people who consider themselves <i>liberal</i> or <i>progressive</i>. An individual's freedom and autonomy tends to be the most important thing to a right wing voter, while those in the left wing focus on social equality. Before the political meaning, <i>right wing</i> described an army's formation.</p></div>`;
