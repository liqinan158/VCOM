Although the term can be used for a variety of birds, it most often refers specifically to a <i>bevy</i> of quail. Other terms exist to describe flocks of other types of birds â€” a murder of crows, for example.</p><p class="long">A <i>bevy</i> can also describe a large gathering of people, usually of the same type (a bevy of schoolchildren; a bevy of tourists). Most often, however, <i>bevy</i> is used to refer to a gathering of women. At a family reunion, you may find your grandmother holding court in the kitchen with a bevy of female relations. Young, attractive women are sometimes referred to, somewhat poetically, as "a <i>bevy</i> of beauties."</p></div>`;
