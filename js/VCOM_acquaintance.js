An acquaintance is less intimate than a friend, like a person in your class whose name you know, but that’s it.  When you “make the acquaintance of” someone, you meet them for the first time. If you know nothing about eggplants, you’d say, “I have little acquaintance with eggplants.”</p></div></div>`;
