Goldilocks would be pleased.</p><p class="long"><i>Sufficient</i> comes from a Latin verb meaning "to meet the need." If something is sufficient it has met, or satisfied, a need. <i>Enough</i> is often used as a synonym for <i>sufficient,</i> and when something is not sufficient, it is too little to take care of what's needed. <i>Sufficient</i> can, however, also suggest just enough and not an abundance, as in "the money was <i>sufficient</i> for groceries, but we needed more to fill the gas tank."</p></div>`;
