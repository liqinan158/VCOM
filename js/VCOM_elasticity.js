The <i>elasticity</i> of a balloon means that if you pop it, it shrinks back to the size it was before you blew it up.</p><p class="long">Rubber bands have elasticity, and so do tennis balls and even human skin. The quality of something that stretches and then returns to its initial shape — its <i>elasticity</i> — is also a term in physics. Physicists describe it as the tendency of a solid object, after being deformed by forces applied to it, to return to its original shape when those forces are taken away. The Greek root of <i>elasticity</i> is <i>elastos</i>, or "flexible."</p></div>`;
