var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">introvert</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">An <i>introvert</i> generally prefers solitary activities to interacting with large groups of people. If you would rather work through your feelings in your diary than have a conversation, then you are an <i>introvert</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Introvert</i> comes from Latin <i>intro-</i>, "inward," and <i>vertere</i>, "turning."  It describes a person who tends to turn inward mentally. Introverts sometimes avoid large groups of people, feeling more energized by time alone. The opposite of an introvert is an <i>extrovert</i>, who finds energy in interactions with others. <i>Introvert</i> can also be a verb, meaning literally to "fold inward," or to "turn inward," as when a child's personality seems to introvert once she starts elementary school.</p></div></div>`;
