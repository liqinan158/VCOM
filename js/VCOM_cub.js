A mother fox sometimes carries her <i>cub</i> by the scruff of its neck.</p><p class="long">Use the word <i>cub</i> when you talk about one of a number of meat-eating mammal babies, including bears, foxes, lions, and tigers. While a tiny bear cub looks as adorable and helpless as a stuffed animal, its mother is ferocious and protective of her cubs. In the old days, people also called a young, immature boy a <i>cub</i> — today, a human cub is more likely to be a junior Boy Scout — a Cub Scout.</p></div>`;
