Steve <i>surfeited</i> himself on jam tarts. Whether <i>surfeit</i> is a noun or a verb (as in "overabundance" or "gorge"), Steve is likely to end up with a bellyache.</p><p class="long"><i>Overabundance</i>, <i>glut</i>, <i>gorge</i>, and <i>cloy</i>: these are all synonyms for <i>surfeit</i>, and they all convey a  sense of too-much-ness, as does the Old French root of the word â€” <i>surfaire</i>, "to overdo."  When it is used in reference to food or eating, <i>surfeit</i> tends to suggest indulging to the point of sickness or disgust. In other contexts, though, the meaning is not necessarily negative: "A surfeit of kindness," for example, would hardly be a bad thing.</p></div>`;
