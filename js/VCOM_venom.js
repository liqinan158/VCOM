However, just to be clear, <i>venom</i> means "poison." Stay away from it.</p><p class="long">Venom is poisonous fluid produced by animals such as snakes, spiders, and certain people. Okay — we take that last one back, sort of. Scientifically speaking, people don’t produce venom, but they can certainly do so in a metaphorical sense. That’s why <i>venom</i> can also be used to mean “malice” or “hatred.” If you encounter someone who seems full of venom, remember that kindness can be a good antidote. (So can a really insulting remark.)</p></div></div>`;
