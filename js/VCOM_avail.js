var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">avail</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>avail</i> means to take advantage of an opportunity, the way you'd be crazy not to <i>avail</i> yourself of a chocolate milkshake on Free Milkshake Day at your local ice cream parlor.</p><p class="long">Sometimes <i>avail</i> is used to mean "help," and in that case it can be used in a sentence like "Nothing seemed to avail me, not even winning the lottery." More often though, <i>avail</i> shows up in the company of "oneself of," as in the sentence, "I hope you avail yourself of my advice, because I'm very wise." It might seem like a complicated way to use a verb, but it's one you should avail yourself of if you're hoping to impress someone.</p></div></div>`;
