There's not a lot of room for dissent in <i>theocracies,</i> where religious leaders are in charge and say they are speaking for God.</p><p class="long">Notice the similarities between <i>theocracy</i> and <i>democracy</i>? In Greek, <i>theo-</i> means "God" and  <i>-kratia</i> "power or rule." A <i>democracy</i> is ruled by <i>dÄ“mos</i>, "the people." An <i>autocracy</i> is one ruled by a single person with absolute power, like a king (or your mom). In <i>theocracies</i>, God rules.</p></div></div>`;
