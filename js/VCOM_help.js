You can <i>help</i> your friend organize a car wash at school by making posters and putting them up all over town.</p><p class="long"><i>Help</i> can also mean to serve food or drink––as in, "<i>Help</i> yourself!" But don't serve yourself too much or there won't be enough for a second <i>helping</i>. One last meaning for <i>help</i> is the people hired to provide domestic services in a home. A nanny, a housekeeper, a gardener are often referred to somewhat derisively as "the <i>help</i>," because their job is helping the family.</p></div>`;
