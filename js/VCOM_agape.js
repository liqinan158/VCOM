You should close it, before it is full of snow.</p><p class="long"><i>Agape</i>, you may have already figured out, comes from the verb <i>gape</i>, meaning "to open wide or split." This is what happens to your mouth when you are looking agape at something in amazement. Don’t confuse mouth-wide-open <i>agape</i> with the other <i>agape</i>, which is spelled the same but pronounced differently and refers to Christian love.</p></div></div>`;
