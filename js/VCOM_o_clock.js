When the clock strikes seven, you might say, "Seven <i>o'clock</i>! Breakfast time!"</p><p class="long">The adverb <i>o'clock</i> is one we tend to use without giving it much thought. Maybe you're more likely to say, "I'm sleepy, but it's only eight," and in this case the <i>o'clock</i> is implied. It's a shortened form of the now obsolete phrase <i>of the clock</i>, from the Middle English <i>of the clokke</i>. You might also use it when you're describing a direction by referring to an imaginary clock: "I saw the deer run by right there, at twelve <i>o'clock</i>."</p></div>`;
