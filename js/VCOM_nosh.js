You might <i>nosh</i> on a slice of cold pizza and a handful of chocolate chips after school.</p><p class="long">Many people like to nosh on popcorn while watching movies, and you could nosh on the cookies you baked for the school bake sale. You can also call a meal a <i>nosh</i>, especially if it's just a snack: "Let's have a <i>nosh</i> before we head back out on the hiking trail." <i>Nosh</i> comes from the Yiddish word -<i>nashn</i>, "nibble," and its earliest use in English, around 1917, was as a shortened form of <i>nosh-house</i>, or "restaurant."</p></div>`;
