If you sit in the top <i>tier</i> of seats at a concert, you can see the whole stage and most of the audience â€” but you probably have to climb lots of stairs.</p><p class="long">A tier can describe a layer of ruffles on a dress, a section of seats in a stadium, or one layer of a fancy cake. You could also talk about a tier in terms of value or position. For example, the most popular, well-known actors might be considered part of the top tier, getting all the best parts. <i>Tier</i> originated from the Old French word <i>tire</i>: rank, sequence, or order.</p></div></div>`;
