A person or thing can be depicted in a particular way through a description, a drawing, a photograph, or any other artistic medium. Whenever a vivid picture of something — like life in Victorian England — is presented, that thing is being depicted. The Latin root <i>depictus</i> comes from the prefix <i>de</i>, meaning "down," and <i>pingere</i>, "to paint," and it means "to portray, paint, sketch or imagine."</p></div></div>`;
