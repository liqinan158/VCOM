But if the ball gets stuck in a tree, they will just stand there, helplessly waiting for it to fall. Try to explain it a Golden Retriever in Latin: they are not <i>ir-</i> going to be able <i>-able</i> to get <i>-retrieve-</i> that ball = it is <i>ir-retriev-able</i>. If you suffer an irretrievable loss — like the death of someone you are close to — that means a loss you may never recover from.</p></div></div>`;
