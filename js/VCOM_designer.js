An architect is a <i>designer</i> of buildings, drawing detailed blueprints indicating what the structures should look like and how they should be built.</p><p class="long">The word <i>designer</i> came into English in the seventeenth century meaning "one who schemes." The word soon came to describe someone who figures out how something should look, especially something artistic. If you're reading a newspaper, a graphic designer planned how the text and images should look on each page. You might also be familiar with a fashion designer, someone who comes up with a vision for a garment and creates sketches to show what the finished product will look like.</p></div>`;
