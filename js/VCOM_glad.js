It means happy or pleased.</p><p class="long">Glad doesn't quite mean jumping for joy — it's more a state of contentment and pleasure. You're glad to hear from an old friend who calls you out of the blue and glad to meet your friendly new neighbors. Glad can also mean "eagerly willing" so you might say, "I'll be glad to taste test those brownies for you!" The Old English source is <i>glæd</i>, "gleaming, joyous, or gracious."</p></div></div>`;
