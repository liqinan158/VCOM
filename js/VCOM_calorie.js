More importantly, a <i>calorie</i> is a unit that you can use to measure the energy in your food.</p><p class="long">From the Latin <i>calor</i>, “to heat,” a <i>calorie</i> is a measurement of heat energy (it may be called a small calorie or a large calorie). When you’re out of the chemistry lab, you’ll most often hear <i>calorie</i> in relation to the energy in food or the energy you burn through exercise. It will also usually be referred to in the plural, as <i>calories</i>. This makes sense: just one calorie won’t make any difference in what you weigh, but many calories will!</p></div></div>`;
