Your cat may have been plump when he was young, and become <i>bony</i> as he got older.</p><p class="long">If you're so skinny that your bones are prominent, your friends might call you bony and encourage you to eat more. Another way to use the adjective <i>bony</i> is to mean "like bone" or "containing bone." Some animals have bony shells or protective plates â€” and you might not enjoy your fish dinner if it's way too bony. <i>Bony</i> shares a root with <i>bone</i>, the Old English <i>ban</i>, "bone or tusk."</p></div>`;
