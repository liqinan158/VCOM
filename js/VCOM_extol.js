If you <i>extol</i> something, you praise it very highly.</p><p class="long">The Bible says: "Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and <i>extol</i> and honor the King of heaven..." Nebuchadnezzar II was king of the second Babylonian Empire, the one who sent the Jews into exile. In some translations of the Bible, the word <i>honor</i> is replaced with <i>glorify</i>. <i>Praise, extol, honor, glorify</i> all mean about the same. The Bible often uses five words when one would be enough.</p></div></div>`;
