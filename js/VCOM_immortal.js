Do you like vampires? Those blood-suckers are <i>immortal,</i> and will live forever — except, of course, if you drive a stake through their heart.</p><p class="long">The word <i>immortal</i> can refer a supernatural being who is worshipped by others, or is a divinity or God in human form, like the gods of Greek and Roman mythology. <i>Immortal</i> can also mean "a person whose fame lasts for many years." If you're a sports legend or a well-known author, you may be remembered as an immortal in your field. <i>Immortal</i> comes from the Old French word <i>immortalité,</i> meaning "deathlessness."</p></div></div>`;
