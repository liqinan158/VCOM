Use the adjective <i>vital</i> to describe something that is important and necessary, or a person full of energy.</p><p class="long"><i>Vital</i> descends from Middle English, from Old French, from Latin <i>vītālis</i>, from <i>vīta</i>, "life." If you are vital to the organization you work for, it means they cannot live without you — or at least that you're an important part of the team. If you're a vital force in your church volunteer group, you probably are a leader with lots of energy to give.</p></div>`;
