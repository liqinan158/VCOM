Christian monks often wear a belted robe-like garment with a <i>cowl</i>.</p><p class="long">Use the word <i>cowl</i> for the hood on a long, wide-sleeved garment, or to refer to the garment itself. The front of a cowl tends to be closed, rather than open like a cloak or a cape, and this was the reason cowls became the formal wear for monks during the Middle Ages â€” the closed cowl was warmer. Catholic and Anglican monks still wear cowls today. The Latin root of <i>cowl</i> is <i>cucullus</i>, or "hood."</p></div>`;
