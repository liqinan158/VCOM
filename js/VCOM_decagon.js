Your geometry teacher would also tell you that a <i>decagon</i> is a polygon.</p><p class="long">The word <i>decagon</i> comes from Greek roots, <i>deka</i>, or "ten," and <i>g≈çnia</i>, "angle or corner." Any ten-sided shape can be called a decagon, whether it's a street sign or the doodle you draw in your notebook during math class. Speaking of math class, in geometry you may learn that a "regular decagon" is one with sides that are all equal to each other and with internal angles that all measure 144 degrees.</p></div></div>`;
