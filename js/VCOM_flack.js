A flack (or flak) jacket will protect your body from projectiles, but it doesn’t protect you from insults. <i>Flack</i> is also a word for a promoter. If you publish a book, you’ll need to flack — or promote it — yourself or hire a professional flack who will convince everyone to buy it. The German root is <i>Fliegerabwehrkanone</i>, "aviator-defense gun."</p></div>`;
