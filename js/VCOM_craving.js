If you have a <i>craving</i> for pickled herring, a tuna sandwich just won't do. Must. Have. Pickled. Herring.</p><p class="long"><i>Craving</i> is the noun that comes from the verb <i>crave</i>, which comes from the Old English word <i>crafian</i>, meaning "to demand, beg." When we talk about <i>cravings</i>, it's almost like the body and not the mind that is demanding something. Pregnant women famously have crazy cravings, sending their partners to the store in the middle of the night for pickles or toffee. Some people have cravings for power or fame: the desire is so strong they can't let it go.</p></div></div>`;
