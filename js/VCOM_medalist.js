Win first place in an Olympic event and you'll be a gold <i>medalist</i>!</p><p class="long">Back in the 1750s, a medalist was a person who made medals from metal â€” a particular kind of metalsmith. By the end of the 18th century, the word was also used for someone who received or won a medal, and that's since become the more common definition. If you want to be a medalist, you'll need to practice your skills at the high jump, start a heroic military career, or become a champion speller.</p></div></div>`;
