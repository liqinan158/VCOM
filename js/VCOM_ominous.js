However, unlike <i>omen,</i> which is a sign of something good or bad to come, <i>ominous</i> always describes something unpleasant or threatening. If the future looks ominous, you've got nothing to look forward to. Figuratively, an ominous sky or ominous clouds promise rain or a storm.</p></div>`;
