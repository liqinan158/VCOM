You might say, "I have tons of friends at my new school" or "Your library is tiny â€” my library has tons more books!" It's a way to play up size or amount while still being vague. <i>Tons</i> comes from <i>ton</i>, which is often used colloquially ("I ate a ton of pasta"), but is also a precise unit for measuring weight.</p></div></div>`;
