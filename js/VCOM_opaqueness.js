The <i>opaqueness</i> of a passing car's windows means that you can't see who's driving, while the <i>opaqueness</i> of a poem makes it hard to figure out the poem's meaning.</p><p class="long">When light can't shine through an object, or can just partially penetrate it, that's due to opaqueness, which you can also call <i>opacity</i>. When something is obscure or impossible to comprehend, that's another type of opaqueness. The opaqueness of that 1,000-page novel you've been trying to slog through might require you to keep looking words up in the dictionary as you go.</p></div>`;
