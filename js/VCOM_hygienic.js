This state was represented by the Goddess Hygieia, the embodiment of health and cleanliness. <i>Hygienic</i> is often used indiscriminately with <i>sanitary,</i> though in fact sanitary implies a particular nose-wrinkling emphasis on proper sewage disposal and clean water that is only a part of the Greeks' original concept of a more comprehensive physical and mental well being.</p></div></div>`;
