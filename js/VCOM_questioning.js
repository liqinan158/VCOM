Sometimes the police will bring a witness to a crime into the station for <i>questioning</i>.</p><p class="long">When you participate in questioning, you may very well have a questioning look on your face. As an adjective, <i>questioning</i> can mean "curious," "confused or perplexed," or even "skeptical." If you show up at school in a clown costume, your teachers and friends might look at you in a questioning way â€” or they may dive right into the questioning, demanding: "What on earth are you wearing?"</p></div>`;
