Some are thick and dense, providing a cushiony area for walking or sitting. <i>Rug</i> also informally means "wig or toupee," so you could say, "Did you see that guy's terrible blonde <i>rug</i>?" And if you want to pretend something didn't happen, you'll have to colloquially "sweep it under the <i>rug</i>," or hide it.</p></div>`;
