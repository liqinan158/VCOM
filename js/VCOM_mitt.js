And if you want to take a cake out of the oven, get an oven <i>mitt</i>, a giant heat-proof mitten. A <i>mitt</i> protects a hand.</p><p class="long">Since mitts were introduced to baseball in the 19th century, every player on a team uses one. Before that, players used their bare hands — or they improvised gloves with the fingers cut off, to slightly pad the catching hand. Today's mitts are wide and sturdy. An oven mitt isn’t helpful in baseball, but it also protects hands. In fact, <i>mitt</i> can also mean "hand" informally: "Get your mitts off my chocolate cupcake!"</p></div>`;
