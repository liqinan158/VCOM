Find a <i>solicitor</i>. England has two levels of attorneys: for big problems, you'll need a barrister, but for your hypothetical legal troubles, a <i>solicitor</i> should do nicely.</p><p class="long">Some highly placed attorneys in the U.S. are also called solicitors. The lawyer in charge of government cases that come before the Supreme Court is the Solicitor General, and that was Elena Kagan's job before President Barack Obama appointed her to the Supreme Court.  <i>Solicitor</i> isn’t always a privileged position. The person who knocks on your door asking you to contribute to some worthy cause is also a <i>solicitor</i> — someone who asks for — or solicits — donations.</p></div></div>`;
