You might <i>explore</i> an island, a European city, or the rooms of an unfamiliar house.</p><p class="long">The Latin root of <i>explore</i> is <i>explorare</i>, meaning "investigate or search out." When you explore a new place, you want to see interesting things and get to know its people. Whenever you delve into something, or investigate it, you explore it. You can even explore an interest, like when you explore African art, or explore an idea or tendency in order to understand it â€” you can explore your fear of snakes to try to get over it.</p></div></div>`;
