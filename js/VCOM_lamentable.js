If your basketball team gets killed in the final game, you could call it a <i>lamentable</i> way for the season to end.</p><p class="long">Something that's not satisfactory can be described as <i>lamentable</i>, like a high school art room equipped with only crayons and construction paper. A person's inappropriate behavior could also be considered lamentable â€” whether it's the cruel words of a bully or your lack of preparation for an important speech. The Latin word <i>lamentationem</i> is at the root of <i>lamentable</i>, and it means "wailing, moaning, or weeping." If a situation is bad enough to make you cry, it's lamentable.</p></div></div>`;
