There are other religions that use the word <i>gentile</i> to describe a non-believer, including Mormonism and Hinduism. More generally, <i>gentile</i> refers to a person who doesn't acknowledge a particular god or belief. The root is the Latin <i>gentilis</i>, whose meaning of "fellow countryman or family member" changed over time to mean "foreign, heathen, pagan."</p></div></div>`;
