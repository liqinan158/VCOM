If you're going to be late to a movie, you should <i>tell</i> your friends so they can save you a seat.</p><p class="long">You might tell someone to be quiet in the library, or tell a bedtime story to your siblings. You can also tell your friend a secret or tell her secret to someone else. Informally, to <i>tell on</i> someone is to inform an authority about something that person did that she wasn't supposed to do. And there's also a way to use <i>tell</i> to mean "determine with certainty," like when you can tell it's going to rain because the sky is so dark.</p></div></div>`;
