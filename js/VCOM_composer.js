A classical <i>composer</i> might work by writing out musical notation and trying things out on the piano.</p><p class="long">If you're a composer, you most likely write classical, jazz, music for film, or another type of primarily instrumental music, without lyrics. A writer of popular or rock music is more likely to be called a "songwriter." A composer might compose symphonies as a profession, or write short tunes as a hobby. In Old French, <i>composer</i> means "put together, arrange, or write," from <i>com-</i>, "with," and <i>poser</i>, "to place."</p></div></div>`;
