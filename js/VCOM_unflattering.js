An <i>unflattering</i> movie review makes the film sound boring or badly acted. When something is <i>flattering</i>, it compliments someone, or shows a person or a thing in its very best light, from the Old French root <i>flater</i>, "caress." Add the "not" prefix <i>un-</i>, and you get <i>unflattering</i>.</p></div></div>`;
