That's always the best way to learn the definition. Likewise, anything you can describe completely is something you can <i>define</i>.</p><p class="long">The early French and Latin roots of the verb mean something closer to "to limit" or "to create a boundary," but this is really what we do when we <i>define</i> something: we limit its meaning to something specific. So when you're thinking about the word <i>define</i>, remember that you're looking to create a boundary of meaning around it, whether you're specifying the meaning of a word or a larger concept. To define a word such as <i>astronomy</i> is to define both the word and the realm of science that it's concerned with.</p></div>`;
