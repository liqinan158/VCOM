It was also common in the early 20th century to refer to children's playgrounds as <i>tot lots</i>. As a verb, <i>tot</i> is an old-fashioned way to say "add," a shortened form of <i>total</i>. So your waiter might say, "I'll be right back with your check as soon as I tot everything up!"</p></div>`;
