You might drape a <i>tarpaulin</i> over your tent when it starts raining in the middle of your camping trip. Or you can just go home.</p><p class="long">Tarpaulins are often called <i>tarps</i> for short. The word probably includes <i>tar</i> because of the original method for waterproofing a tarpaulin, which involved spreading tar on a heavy piece of canvas. The <i>pall</i> part means "cloth." During the 19th century, it was common to abbreviate the word as <i>paulin</i>, especially in nautical terminology.</p></div></div>`;
