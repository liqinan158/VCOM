Long ago, the word <i>nay</i> was simply used as a substitute for "no," but it sounds odd today: "<i>Nay</i>, I don't need any ketchup with my fries." You can use it, however, to mean "this word is more appropriate," as when you say, "I'm upset, <i>nay</i> furious, that you forgot my birthday."</p></div>`;
