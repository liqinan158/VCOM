Although it can be used neutrally, often if someone calls you a libertine, they disapprove of your lack of morality. In the 14th century, a <i>libertine</i> was "a freed slave," from the Latin <i>liber</i>, "free." Starting in the mid-1500s, <i>libertine</i> had a religious and political connotation, referring to a group that opposed Calvinism. By the nineteenth century, the word became strongly associated with immorality and debauchery.</p></div></div>`;
