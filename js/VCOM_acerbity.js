Many foods have acerbity, like limes and pickles. <i>Acerbity</i> can also be a personality trait, like a professor who snaps at you if you talk in class. In Charles Dickens’s novel <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, the character Ebenezer Scrooge is a great example of acerbity.  He is a bitter, stingy businessman who won’t help anyone but himself.  Don’t worry; he learns his lesson in the end.</p></div>`;
