If there's a <i>clock</i> in your calculus classroom, it can sometimes be hard to keep from watching the minutes tick by.</p><p class="long">You might have an antique grandfather clock in your hall or an alarm clock beside your bed. Clocks are either analog, with hands that move around a numbered circular face, or digital, showing the time in digits, like 4:27. If you <i>clock</i> your friend as she runs a mile, it means you keep track of how long it takes her. Originally, the word was <i>clokke</i>, "clock with bells," from the Medieval Latin <i>clocca</i>, "bell."</p></div></div>`;
