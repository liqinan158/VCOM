If you tend to <i>bawl</i> at sad movies, you might want to bring some tissues for wiping your tears and blowing your nose.</p><p class="long">If a baby bawls all night, he doesn't just cry â€” he sobs and howls. You can also use the verb to talk about other loud sounds, like shouts: "He <i>bawls</i> out orders while we stand there, confused," or even amusement: "She <i>bawls</i> with laughter all through the woman's strange speech." In the 15th century, to <i>bawl</i> was to "bark like a dog," from the Old Norse <i>baula</i>, "to low or moo like a cow."</p></div>`;
