You dislike it so much, you want nothing to do with it. If something is <i>repellent</i>, it is highly offensive or disgusting.</p><p class="long">To correctly pronounce <i>repellent</i>, accent the second syllable: "ruh-PELL-unt." Being repellent is sometimes a good thing, like when you're camping â€” your water-repellent tent gets you through a rainstorm and bug repellent keeps you free of itchy bites. The word originates from the Old French word <i>repeller</i>, meaning "to drive away, remove."</p></div></div>`;
