Many fraternal and theatrical organizations still maintain buildings called <i>guild</i> halls for meetings and activities.</p><p class="long">The earliest guilds were for religious purposes as burial societies and offering financial support.  In the later Middle Ages, they became organizations to support various trades and crafts. As the forerunners of modern unions, they provided support for their members and were charged with assuring quality in each member's products. The word <i>guild</i> comes originally from the Scandinavian, with roots that mean "payment of tribute," similar to the German <i>gelt</i> ("money"), possibly to reflect the dues paid by members.</p></div>`;
