Climbing to the summit of a mountain can give you an <i>eyeful</i> of the beautiful valley below.</p><p class="long">A complete view of anything can be described colloquially as an <i>eyeful</i>, but for some reason people usually mean "a good look at a naked person" when they say it. Your mom might say, "A streaker ran nude through the football game, and boy did we get an <i>eyeful</i>!" Occasionally, the word means "a good-looking person," as when someone says, "Your cousin's really an <i>eyeful</i>!" This casual word has been used since the late 18th century.</p></div></div>`;
