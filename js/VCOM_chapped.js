Little kids tend to lick their <i>chapped</i> lips, which makes them even more <i>chapped</i>.</p><p class="long">Skiers, winter hikers, sailors, and others who spend time outdoors in cold or windy conditions are probably familiar with chapped lips. Other exposed parts of your body can get chapped as well. <i>Chapped</i> comes from the verb <i>chap</i>, "become cracked," from the 15th century <i>chappen</i>, "to split or burst open." Beyond this, the roots of <i>chapped</i> aren't certain, though it may be related to the Middle Dutch <i>kappen</i>, "to cut."</p></div></div>`;
