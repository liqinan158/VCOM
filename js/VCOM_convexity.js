You could describe the <i>convexity</i> of a round, squat vase.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>convexity</i> is somewhat technical for everyday use â€” you're more likely to see it in a math textbook than to hear a friend use it to talk about a goldfish bowl. Still, it is a perfectly good way to describe anything that curves or bulges outward, whether it's the belly of a Chinese Buddha or a balloon. <i>Convexity</i> comes from the adjective <i>convex</i>, with its Latin root word <i>convexus</i>, "vaulted or arched."</p></div></div>`;
