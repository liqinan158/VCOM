You could refer to large pieces of stone or wood as <i>slabs</i> too. Even your lunch might be a slab, if it's a thick hunk of cheesy pizza or a huge slab of bread slathered with peanut butter. The origins of the word <i>slab</i> are unknown, though we do know it's been around since the thirteenth century.</p></div>`;
