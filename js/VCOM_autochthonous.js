If kane toads originated in your area, then they’re an <i>autochthonous</i> species.</p><p class="long">The root of the word <i>autochthonous</i> traces back to the Greek word <i>autokhthon</i>, meaning literally “sprung from the land itself.” Something that’s autochthonous doesn’t have to really spring from the land, but it might seem like it’s been there forever, almost as long as the land. The word is often used for people, like the autochthonous groups of Australia, but it can refer to other things as well, such as autochthonous cultural traditions or an autochthonous species.</p></div>`;
