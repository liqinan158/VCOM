var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">furtively</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The adverb <i>furtively</i> is great for describing the movements or behavior of someone who's being sneaky or sly. Kids decorating their neighbor's trees with toilet paper on Halloween tend to sneak <i>furtively</i> around the yard.</p><p class="long">If you do something furtively, you don't want anyone to notice you; you're keeping a low profile. Usually, a person acting furtively feels guilty, or knows they're in danger of getting in trouble or being embarrassed. <i>Furtively</i> comes from the Latin word for "theft," <i>fur</i>. You can think of <i>furtively</i> as meaning "acting like a thief." Even though not everyone who behaves furtively is a thief, you might think they are, seeing them sneak away.</p></div>`;
