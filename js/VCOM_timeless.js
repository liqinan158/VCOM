It's just as good or true now as when it was created.</p><p class="long">One way to compliment things — like art, buildings, or works of literature — is to call them "timeless." If you said a painting from the 1930's is timeless, you're saying it's just as great now as it was then. A timeless proverb is always true, regardless of when it's said. Timeless literature like Shakespeare is always enjoyable. The opposite of <i>timeless</i> is <i>dated</i>: something dated seems stuck in a particular age and is no longer relevant.</p></div>`;
