It's also considered insulting and derogatory. The character of the sot has featured in literature and film for years, going at least as far back as Shakespeare, whose famous sots included the drunken Falstaff in "Henry IV" and Sir Toby Belch in "Twelfth Night." In Old English, a <i>sott</i> was a "stupid person or a fool."</p></div>`;
