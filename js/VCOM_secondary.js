Secondary duties must be done next, since second is a form of the number two. You could say your secondary goal at a job is to get experience, if your main goal is to make money. Also, people will sometimes say, "This is our goal. Everything else is <i>secondary</i>." That means other concerns are trivial or unimportant.
