Tomatoes will <i>ripen</i> after you pick them, becoming darker red and more juicy.</p><p class="long">You can use <i>ripen</i> to talk about the maturing process of all fruits, and some vegetables â€” apples, peppers, and corn all need to ripen before they're at the perfect, delicious state for being eaten. Figuratively, you can also talk about people this way: "She is really starting to <i>ripen</i> as an actor!" Before <i>ripen</i> was coined around 1560, the verb was <i>ripe</i>, as in, "When the avocados <i>ripe</i>, I'll make guacamole."</p></div></div>`;
