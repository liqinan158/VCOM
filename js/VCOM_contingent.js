Making money is <i>contingent</i> on finding a good-paying job.</p><p class="long">When an event or situation is contingent, it means that it depends on some other event or fact. For example, sometimes buying a new house has to be contingent upon someone else buying your old house first. That way you don't end up owning two houses!
