Some painters, like El Greco, are known for their strange, <i>elongated</i> figures.</p><p class="long">Things can be elongated because they're literally pulled and stretched, while others are described this way because they are very long and thin to start with. A young woman's elongated neck or your tall, skinny dad's elongated body are both examples of this. The Latin root is <i>elongare</i>, "to prolong or protract," from <i>longus</i>, or "long."</p></div></div>`;
