You can try sitting on the stage, but you'll probably be thrown out.</p><p class="long">Sometimes <i>auditorium</i> refers to the whole building where performances take place, not just the area for the audience. As the spelling of the word suggests, it's related to the word <i>auditory</i>, meaning "something related to hearing." In fact, <i>auditorium</i> is a Latin term meaning "a place where something is heard," — and of course, as high school and college students know all too well, that can mean lectures as well as concerts or plays.</p></div>`;
