You might be tempted to tell your parents a <i>trumped-up</i> story about a mean math teacher to explain a bad grade.</p><p class="long">When you hear about someone being arrested on "trumped-up charges," that means that they've been falsely accused. There's a sense of exaggeration in this term, as wellâ€”if your excuse for being late is trumped-up, you're concocting extra details to make it sound more impressive. <i>Trumped-up</i> was first recorded in the early 18th century, and it comes from the idiomatic <i>trump up</i>, "devise deceitfully or dishonestly."</p></div></div>`;
