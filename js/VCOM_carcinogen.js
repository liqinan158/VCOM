Cigarette smoke, car exhaust, asbestos: all of these are known <i>carcinogens</i>.

Think of the Book of Genesis, or the beginning of all things. "Carcinoma," the name of a specific type of cancer, comes from the Greek <i>karkinos</i>, which means "crab" and "ulcer," as well as the animal associated with the astrological sign of Cancer. So you can see that <i>carcinogen</i> simply means "generating cancer."</p></div></div>`;
