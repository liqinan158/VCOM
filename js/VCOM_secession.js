If France has really, truly had it with the European Union, then a French <i>secession</i> movement may be in order.</p><p class="long">You could think of <i>secession</i> as a kind of divorce for governments, an official and often lasting split between an alliance, federation, or other political group. <i>Secession</i> is the noun version of the verb <i>secede</i> (meaning to withdraw from an organization), and when a secession takes place the group doing the seceding makes a formal departure from the original group. A famous example of political secession happened right before the American Civil War, when eleven southern states withdrew from the U.S. government over the issue of slavery.</p></div></div>`;
