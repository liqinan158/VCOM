If it's no, you might still have a chance. But if she gives you a categorical no, she will never change her mind. Less often, <i>categorical</i> is used to describe something that is part of a certain category or group. A Doberman at the Westminster Dog Show might be the categorical winner, meaning it is the best Doberman but not the winner of the show.</p></div>`;
