A con artist might create a <i>fictive</i> persona in order to dupe a rich heiress.</p><p class="long">Along with <i>fictitious</i> and <i>fictional</i>, <i>fictive</i> is an adjective related to <i>fiction</i>. They all come from the Latin word <i>fictus</i> meaning "to form," because they have to do with things formed in the imagination. Calling something or someone <i>fictive</i> suggests it has been invented for a special purpose, such as a character in a story that makes a point about society in general. Anthropologists are also fans of the word <i>fictive</i>: if you have an Aunt Mary but she's not technically your aunt, then she's what is known as "fictive kin."</p></div></div>`;
