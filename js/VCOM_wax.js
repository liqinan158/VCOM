It wanes, or diminishes in size, as the new moon approaches. This is the most common context for the verb <i>wax</i>, but it is also used to describe other phenomena that grow or increase, particularly those that are cyclical. Figuratively, if you wax eloquent, lyrical or poetic about something, you talk about it at great length and with growing enthusiasm.
