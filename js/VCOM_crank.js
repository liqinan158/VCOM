The earliest automobiles required drivers to <i>crank</i> the engine before they could climb in and start driving.</p><p class="long">You might crank a paper towel machine in a restroom to unspool the towels, or crank a music box to start it up â€” in either case, you're turning a handle, which is also called a <i>crank</i>. You can also say that you crank up the engine when you start your car, even though you're not literally turning or winding anything. A completely different kind of <i>crank</i> is a grouchy, opinionated person. This last meaning comes from <i>cranky</i>.</p></div>`;
