You might <i>howl</i> every once in a while, but it's more common to hear wolves and dogs let loose and <i>howl</i>, especially in the presence of a full moon.</p><p class="long">Terribly sad or fearful people howl, and wolves howl to communicate with each other. Your dog might howl at the sound of a passing fire truck, which also makes a noise with its siren that you can call a <i>howl</i>. Before the 1400s, the word was <i>houlen</i>, a word that probably emerged as an imitation of the way a howl sounds.</p></div>`;
