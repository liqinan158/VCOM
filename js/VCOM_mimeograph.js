The copies themselves were often also called <i>mimeographs</i>. Even after the invention of modern photocopiers, mimeographs were a popular way to make cheap copies, and many offices still had the machines as late as the 1990's. The root of <i>mimeograph</i> is the Greek <i>mimeisthai</i>, "to mimic, represent, or imitate."</p></div></div>`;
