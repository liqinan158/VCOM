We like it when our hard work pays off and ideas come to fruition. Carmen was thrilled when her plan to get into law school came to fruition. And when the kids' idea to start a wild tricycle gang came to fruition, they sped off joyfully. <i>Fruition</i> also refers to the state of bearing fruit, like when apples in the orchard come to fruition. The trees are probably happy then, too.</p></div></div>`;
