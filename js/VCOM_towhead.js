It's most common to describe blond children as <i>towheads</i>.</p><p class="long">A true towhead has hair so light that it's nearly white, which is why most towheads are kids. Typically, blond hair grows darker as people age â€” even if you are blond as an adult, you hair will still be a darker shade of blond than it was when you were a young child. The word comes from the noun <i>tow</i> in the sense of "flax," which is usually a golden color.</p></div></div>`;
