It’s a bunch of guns on the ground.  A <i>soldier</i> is the man or woman who fights for their government and carries the weapons, risking their life in the process.  The word comes from the Latin <i>solidus</i>, which is the name of the gold coin used to pay soldiers who fought in the Roman army.  To “soldier on” means to not give up even when life is tough, like soldiering on through difficult vocabulary.</p></div>`;
