Studying the <i>humanities</i> gives you general knowledge, but not a practical trade — you probably wouldn’t study <i>humanities</i> at beauty school.</p><p class="long">If you're studying to be a dentist or a blacksmith, you're learning to be something in particular. Studying the humanities is different. The humanities provide general knowledge about the best accomplishments of human beings throughout history. Learning the works of Shakespeare, Plato, and Beethoven is part of the humanities. The humanities make a person educated, but not necessarily for a specific profession. Most people require a more specific area of study beyond the humanities.</p></div>`;
