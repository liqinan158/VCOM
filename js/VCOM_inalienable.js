That  something would be called <i>inalienable</i>. The word refers to a natural right that cannot be revoked by an outside force.</p><p class="long">The word <i>inalienable</i> is often linked to human rights — you’ve probably heard the term “inalienable rights.” In the Declaration of Independence Thomas Jefferson (using the <em>un-</em> variant) wrote that all men are "endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights" including "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” The spelling may vary but the meaning is clear: an inalienable right is something that can’t be given or taken away by a government or another legal power.</p></div>`;
