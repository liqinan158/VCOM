An arm in <i>traction</i> is temporarily tied up, but it is probably on the mend.</p><p class="long">A person in <i>traction</i> is presently immobile, but <i>traction</i> can also be used to describe the state of an object being pulled, or the friction between that object and the surface it is pulled across. <i>Traction</i> can also refer to something or someone that has picked up movement, like an idea or a candidate. If your idea for chocolate covered onions has gained traction, it is becoming popular; if it has lost traction, people have come to their senses.</p></div>`;
