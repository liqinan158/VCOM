When you insert yourself into a conversation, you’re joining in, whether your friends want you to or not. <i>Insert</i> can also mean to fit snugly into, or to tuck. You might fit a card into an envelope that fits it perfectly, or insert first one leg and then another into a pair of tights.</p></div></div>`;
