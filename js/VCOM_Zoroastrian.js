Some scholars credit the <i>Zoroastrian</i> faith with being the oldest monotheistic religion â€” the first to worship a single god.</p><p class="long">Zoroastrians follow one of the world's oldest known religions, <i>Zoroastrianism</i> or <i>Mazdayasna</i>. The original Zoroastrians followed a Persian prophet, Zoroaster, in an area that's now Iran. Zoroastrianism was Persia's state religion from the 6th century BCE until the area was conquered by Islamic Arabs in the 7th century AD. Today, Zoroastrians form a minority religious group in Iran, as well as in India and Pakistan, where they're known as Parsis.</p></div>`;
