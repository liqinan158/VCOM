The song “We Wish You a Merry Christmas” implores someone to “bring us some figgy <i>pudding</i>,” but chocolate or vanilla would be much easier to find.</p><p class="long">Most pudding is made with milk, sugar, and flavoring with a thickening agent like cornstarch. Your favorite might be dark chocolate, butterscotch, or rice pudding. These are delicious, smooth, and usually served cold. In Britain, <i>pudding</i> simply means "dessert," but in North America pudding is a specific kind of after-dinner treat. Back in the 1300s, <i>pudding</i> had a different meaning: "a kind of sausage." You can still get that kind of blood pudding in England. If you must.</p></div></div>`;
