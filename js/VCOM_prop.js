A <i>prop</i> is also something that goes on stage, like a garbage can in a Beckett play.</p><p class="long">When you use a prop, you can say you prop something, or prop it up: "Here, <i>prop</i> your blanket fort up with this chair." This handy word also means "a moveable object used on the set of a movie or play." If you get a film job as a prop master, you'll be in charge of placing props in the correct spot before a scene is shot. This theatrical meaning is actually a shortened form of <i>properties</i>.</p></div></div>`;
