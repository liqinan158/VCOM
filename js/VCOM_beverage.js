It's something you might offer a guest in your house; it's also the favorite moniker of companies that manufacture both soda and juice â€” they call themselves <i>beverage</i> companies.</p><p class="long">One of the most popular <i>beverages</i> in history is Coca-Cola, developed in 1886. Initially, Coke was called a brain tonic for intellectuals. Ingredients of the original recipe included coca leaves and cola nuts, and until 1909 contained small amounts of cocaine. Today, the Coca Cola company markets hundreds of <i>beverages</i> including soft drinks, juices, and sports drinks.</p></div></div>`;
