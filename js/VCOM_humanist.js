Well, perhaps you’re a budding <i>humanist</i>, someone who wants the best for humankind. A <i>humanist</i> is also a scholar of the classics and liberal arts.</p><p class="long">The word <i>humanist</i> comes from the Renaissance, by way of an Italian poet, Lodovico Ariosto. It started out as a name for a scholar of classical Greek and Latin literature. It still describes someone who studies liberal arts, or humanities, but now a humanist is also someone who’s especially interested in what's good for humanity. Humanists want everyone to have enough food, shelter, and dignity.</p></div></div>`;
