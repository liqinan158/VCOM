Most comic book villains — and a few real people, too — spend their lives in pursuit of world <i>domination</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Domination</i> comes from the Latin word <i>dominus</i>, meaning "master" or "lord." This word conveys the idea not just of leadership, but of absolute, unchallengeable authority. So, just because your boss is in charge of the office doesn’t mean she engages in domination. Wait until she forces you to remove hundreds of staples by hand while she sends your coworker all the way to Costa Rica to fetch the coffee. But we hope it never comes to that.</p></div></div>`;
