So a conscientious person will work hard and act thoughtfully, while an unconscientious person acts without thinking about what is right, fair, or appropriate. An unconscientious journalist might write a story without carefully checking her facts, and an unconscientious dog owner lets their badly behaved cocker spaniel run loose around the neighborhood.</p></div></div>`;
