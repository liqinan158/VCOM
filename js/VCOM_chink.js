A <i>chink</i> in your bedroom curtains might let enough early morning sunlight in that you'll wake up before your alarm goes off.</p><p class="long">Use the word <i>chink</i> to describe the slightest gap between slats in a blind or crevice between two rocks on a cliff. Sometimes the light that shows through this space is also called a <i>chink</i>; "Just a <i>chink</i> of light shone beneath the shade on the airplane window." <i>Chink</i> comes from the Old English <i>cinu</i>, "fissure," and the related <i>cinan</i>, "to crack or split."</p></div></div>`;
