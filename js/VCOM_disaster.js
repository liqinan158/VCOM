The second part of the word is derived from <i>astron</i> — "star" or "planet," familiar from words like <i>astronomy</i> and <i>astronaut</i>. <i>Dis-</i> is prefix with a meaning similar to "un-" or "mis-," but with clearly negative connotations. Translated literally, <i>disaster</i> means "bad or unlucky star," and it's a relic of a time when astrology was considered a serious science that could predict events — including <i>disasters</i> you might try to avoid — in your life on Earth!</p></div></div>`;
