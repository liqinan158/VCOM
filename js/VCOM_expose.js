var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">expose</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>expose</i> means to uncover or allow to be in the open air. If you take off your coat and <i>expose</i> your bare arms to the terrible cold, your tattoos might freeze off. (Note: We don’t actually know if this is physically possible.)</p><p class="long">When you pronounce <i>expose</i> as it’s spelled, it can mean to leave out in the air, to put in peril (when you <i>expose</i> someone to danger), or to uncover. All of those examples are actions. However, when you pronounce it as though there is a French accent on the final "e," <i>ex-poh-ZAY</i>, it means the unmasking or exposure of something hidden (and usually bad or fraudulent), as when you watch an <i>expose</i> on 60 Minutes about the evils of frozen orange juice or some other toxic substance.</p></div>`;
