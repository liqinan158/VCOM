Another kind of <i>declination</i> is when something slopes down, like the <i>declination</i> of a playground slide.</p><p class="long">Look at the noun <i>declination</i> and you can see the verb <i>decline</i>, which means "to lessen," "to slope down," and "to refuse." Declination is the process of doing any of these things. In astronomy, it's also the distance between an object and the celestial equator, measured at an angle. The Latin root is <i>declinatio</i>, "a bending away."</p></div>`;
