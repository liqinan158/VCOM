If you switch from a twin to a queen-sized bed, you'll need new <i>bedding</i>.</p><p class="long">When a college student moves into a dorm room she brings her own bedding, and when your grandmother gets her guest room ready for a visitor, she might wash all the bedding. <i>Bedding</i> also means the straw, hay, or other materials that a farm animal sleeps on â€” or the shredded paper you use to line your gerbil's cage. It comes from the Old English word <i>beddinge</i>, "bed covering," from <i>bedd</i>, "bed" or "resting place."</p></div></div>`;
