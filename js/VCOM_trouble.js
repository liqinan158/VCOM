If you have <i>trouble</i> getting along with a classmate, it is hard to be friendly with him or her.</p><p class="long">Whether you have trouble finding your shoes, you're in trouble with your teacher, or you go to a lot of trouble buying the kind of tea your sister likes, you face an annoying — and possibly distressing — difficulty. When you use <i>trouble</i> as a verb, it tells who or what is making life hard for you, like a headache that troubles you or childhood memories of encounters with scary clowns that probably trouble you even more deeply.</p></div>`;
