People can also <i>park</i> a car, which is to pull into a parking space and stop. Just don’t <i>park</i> your car in a <i>park</i>. Unless you’re a squirrel.</p><p class="long">A city park usually has playgrounds, sports fields, walking paths, grass, and trees. There are also larger tracts of wild public land also known as parks, and these often have hiking trails, mountains, or bodies of water. <i>Park</i> is a verb too, meaning "drive into a parking space," so you could park your scooter at the park. Originally this verb referred exclusively to military vehicles, but by 1844 you could park any vehicle at all.</p></div></div>`;
