As a noun, it can mean a liberation, an unfastening, or the condition of being made available, like a movie or a CD.  “When is the new Spiderman movie being released?” you might ask your best friend.  As a verb, it can mean to relieve of suffering or obligation, like a debt.  But it can also mean to lay off from a job, or surrender.  “Release me from having to watch this terrible movie!” you could end up saying about the 16th Spiderman sequel.  And who would blame you?</p></div></div>`;
