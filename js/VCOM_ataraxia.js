Many people who meditate hope to achieve a state of <i>ataraxia</i>.</p><p class="long">If you tend to get flustered, you're probably envious of your calm, serene friend's ataraxia â€” it might seem like she never seems to worry about anything. This word is sometimes written as <i>ataraxy</i> in English, from the Greek root <i>ataraxia</i>, literally "impassiveness," from <i>a-</i>, "not," and <i>tarassein</i>, "to disturb or confuse." In ancient Greece, the Epicureans most famously sought the state of ataraxia, which they considered to be true happiness.</p></div></div>`;
