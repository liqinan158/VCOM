It might help to remember that it begins with "ex-," like the word <i>explain</i>, which is similar in meaning.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>explicate</i> comes from the Latin <i>explicƒÅre</i>, which means "to unfold or unravel." This is a good description of a word that means to explain something to make it clearer and more easily understandable. Think of a puzzle or mystery: when you solve it, you sometimes have to explicate how you arrived at the solution, telling how you used the clues given to find the answer.</p></div>`;
