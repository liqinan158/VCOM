It's painful when your dog climbs into your lap, poking you with his <i>sharp</i> toenails.</p><p class="long">A knife and a pointed stick are sharp, since they can pierce or cut, and a piercing pain in your neck is also <i>sharp</i>. You can also use <i>sharp</i> to describe a smart person or clever decision â€” or someone who dresses well, or the clothes such a person wears. <i>Sharp</i> also means clear, like sharp images in a book of black and white photography, or sudden, like a sharp turn in a mountain road.</p></div>`;
