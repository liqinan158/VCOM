Mechanics often use a <i>chock</i> as a safety measure while they're working on a car.</p><p class="long">Even if you've set the parking brake on your car, it's safer to also use a chock while you're working on it to ensure it doesn't move. There are special chocks for motorcycles, airplanes, and heavy trucks. You can also use <i>chock</i> as a verb, to mean "stop from rolling forward." The word's original meaning was "lumpy piece of wood," from Old North French <i>choque</i>, or "block."</p></div>`;
