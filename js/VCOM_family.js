Sometimes the word <i>family</i> specifically means a group of parents and children, so you could be referring to your crazy parents or kids.</p><p class="long"><i>Family</i> is used many different ways. It can mean "household," or the people you live with, or it can refer to a partner and the children you are raising together. Your family can include people you've never met, like distant cousins, if you're using it to talk about the wider group of all of your relatives. There's also the scientific term <i>family</i>, which is a term that ranks the way different organisms are related to each other.</p></div>`;
