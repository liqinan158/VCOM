If you memorize a <i>villanelle</i> and recite it in class, your English teacher will be very impressed!</p><p class="long">The villanelle got its start as a poetic ballad influenced by a rustic Italian song called a <i>villanella</i>. Though the form has evolved, it still includes song-like refrains, giving the poem a musical sound. A villanelle has five stanzas of tercets, or three lines, and one quatrain (four lines). One of the most well-known villanelles in English is Dylan Thomas's "Do not go gentle into that good night."</p></div></div>`;
