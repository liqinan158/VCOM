They had cannons for those bigger jobs.</p><p class="long">Just like the bomb itself, the word <i>petard</i> has mostly fallen out of use today. It may be familiar, however, from the phrase "hoist with your own <i>petard</i>," which comes from Shakespeare (though he called it a <i>petar</i>) and means "to be hurt by your own plan to hurt someone else," "to fall into your own trap," or, essentially, "to be blown up by your own bomb."</p></div></div>`;
