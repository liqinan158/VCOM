The word <i>ecclesiastic</i> describes a member of the clergy, typically someone associated with a Christian church.</p><p class="long">The word <i>ecclesiastic</i> has origins in the Greek word <i>ekklesiastes</i>, meaning "speaker in an assembly or church," and can be used to describe someone associated with a church, such as a cleric or a priest. When you see an English word that begins with the <i>eccles</i> bit, you can be pretty sure that its meaning will somehow involve religious matters. That’s because <i>ekklēsia</i> is the Greek word for church and it has influenced the spelling of many English words of a religious nature, such as <i>ecclesial</i>, <i>ecclesiolatry</i>, and <i>ecclesiarch</i>.</p></div>`;
