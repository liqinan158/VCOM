After years of not studying Spanish, you could decide to <i>rededicate</i> yourself to becoming truly fluent before your trip to Barcelona.</p><p class="long">You can rededicate your life to doing good works — in other words, devote yourself to charity again after taking some time off. Your friend who had given up on her yoga practice after pulling a muscle might decide to rededicate herself to doing yoga every day and finally being able to stand on her head. When you <i>dedicate</i>, you devote — add the "again" prefix <i>re-</i> and you do it again.</p></div>`;
