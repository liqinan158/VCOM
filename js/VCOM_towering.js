There's the towering basketball player in your yoga class who is at least a foot taller than the other students, and the towering addition your neighbor is building on his house â€” the one that will block your view of the lake. The verb <i>tower</i> means "to rise high," from the Latin for "tower," <i>turris</i>.</p></div>`;
