A philanthropist might devote her life to the <i>amelioration</i> of poverty and hunger.</p><p class="long">Any time there's amelioration, something negative is becoming more positive. If your landlord improves the water pressure and lowers the rent, that's amelioration. Often this word has to do with words themselves and how some change in meaning over the years, becoming more positive. A good example is <i>terrific</i>, which once meant "causing terror" and now means "wonderful" or "awesome." Through amelioration, <i>terrific</i> went from a negative meaning to a positive one.</p></div>`;
