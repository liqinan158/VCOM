Use <i>aplomb</i> to show great restraint under even the most trying circumstances. In retail, it's always a good idea to handle the angry customers with <i>aplomb</i>.</p><p class="long">Angry at the long lines at the grocery store? Irritated because the driver ahead cut you off? Take a deep breath, and approach life's messes with aplomb. When you think of <i>aplomb</i>, think cool, calm and collected. Not frazzled, furious, and fiery. <i>Aplomb</i> comes from the French word meaning "perpendicularity," from the phrase <i>Ã  plomb</i> for "poised upright, balanced."</p></div>`;
