To practice <i>masonry</i>, you have to be strong enough to lift very heavy rocks.</p><p class="long">Some masonry experts (called <i>masons</i>) essentially "glue" bricks together with mortar, making walls, outdoor stoves, or walking paths. You can also call a person who does this a <i>bricklayer</i>. Other masonry is made with concrete blocks, granite, or large stones. Dry stone walls are a type of masonry constructed with no mortarâ€”the stones are shaped and arranged so that they fit together securely.</p></div></div>`;
