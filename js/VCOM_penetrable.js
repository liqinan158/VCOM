A coffee filter is <i>penetrable</i>, for example, because it allows water to drip through it.</p><p class="long">Your curtains are penetrable if they let sunlight peek through, and a country's borders are considered penetrable if they allow people to pass through them unnoticed by guards or customs officials. In basketball, having a penetrable defense is bad news â€” it means it allows the opposition's players to get right up to the basket, where they can easily shoot. Sometimes <i>penetrable</i> means "understandable," as in a penetrable poem or penetrable song lyrics.</p></div></div>`;
