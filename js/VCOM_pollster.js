Pollsters sometimes also ask people questions about their opinions on social and political issues. <i>Pollster</i>, coined in 1939, comes from <i>poll</i>, "to take votes" or "to survey," and originally, "head of hair." This meaning was first extended from "head" to "person," and then in the 1620s to "counting heads."</p></div>`;
