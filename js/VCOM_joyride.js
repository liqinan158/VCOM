Try finding your joy elsewhere!</p><p class="long">While you can say, "Let's go for a <i>joyride</i>!" when you're inviting a friend for a spin around town in your red convertible, the word usually implies something less innocent. The criminal kind of joyride involves stealing a car for the sole purpose of driving it, fast, and then abandoning it. Taking cars for a joyride was a more common crime in past decades, before car alarms and other theft-prevention devices became commonly used.</p></div>`;
