To understand <i>inwrought</i>, imagine goblets encrusted or <i>inwrought</i> with jewels, and garments <i>inwrought</i> with silver and gold.</p><p class="long">If <i>inwrought</i> makes you think of a Tolkein-esque fantasy world where magically empowered swords are <i>wrought</i> on Elven fires, good. <i>Inwrought</i> comes from the Middle English word for "work or make," and should conjure the early English history Tolkein drew on for inspiration. If the Middle English associations are leaving you cold, just remember <i>inwrought</i> by remembering the relationship between <i>wrought</i>, meaning "worked or made," and <i>wright</i>, which means "maker," as in a <i>playwright</i>, or "a maker of plays." Pretty soon <i>inwrought's</i> meaning will be inwrought into the fabric of your brain.</p></div>`;
