If you stumble off your friend's sailboat into the water, she'll throw you a <i>lifeline</i>.</p><p class="long">When sailors need to rescue a swimmer or a clumsy passenger, it helps to have a lifeline handy. And when you receive other kinds of vital support or help — a mobile phone, or a job recommendation, or a scholarship for college, for example — you can also call them <i>lifelines</i>. This figurative meaning has been around since the 19th century, while the "live-saving rope" definition is the earliest one, from about 1700.</p></div></div>`;
