If you have an old bike that can't be repaired, you might take it to the <i>dump</i>.</p><p class="long">Some towns have dumps where residents can freely dispose of garbage, while others require people to pay for the rubbish they bring. You can also call a dump a "landfill," but <i>dump</i> makes sense â€” it comes from the verb <i>dump</i>, "to toss, drop, or throw away." A figurative meaning of the word is to abruptly and unkindly break off a romantic relationship with someone: "It would be so mean to <i>dump</i> him on his birthday."</p></div>`;
