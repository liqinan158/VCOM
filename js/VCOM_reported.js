Sometimes the adjective <i>reported</i> implies that what's being stated might not be entirely true: "The <i>reported</i> casualties of the bomb are small, but some citizens claim there were many more." The root of <i>reported</i> is the Old French <i>reporter</i>, "to tell, relate, or bring back," from the Latin <i>reportare</i>, "carry back or bring back."</p></div>`;
