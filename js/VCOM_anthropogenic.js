If your town has rerouted water from the river for drinking water, that is an <i>anthropogenic</i> activity.</p><p class="long">Whenever you see the word root <i>anthro</i>, you can bet there’s a person involved, and <i>anthropogenic</i> is a particularly good example. From the Greek <i>anthropogenes</i>, meaning "born of man,” <i>anthropogenic</i> can refer to any changes in nature that are caused by people — like the existence of roads or cities where once there were forests. Most often, you will hear <i>anthropogenic</i> as an adjective describing pollution — such as the anthropogenic causes of the hole in the ozone layer.</p></div>`;
