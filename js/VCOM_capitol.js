In the United States, each state has an individual capitol building, and the federal government has one too â€” although when you mention "the <i>Capitol</i>" in Washington, D.C., it is capitalized. Speaking of which, be careful not to confuse <i>capitol</i> with its homophone, <i>capital</i>. <i>Capitol</i> comes from the Latin <i>Capitolium</i>, a famous ancient Roman temple.</p></div>`;
