Graded rankings are arranged by step––one step up from a grade of B is a grade of A, and a slope is graded, rising not by steps but by degree. Note that <i>graded</i> can be used as an adjective, as in "She handed out the <i>graded</i> tests," or as a verb, as in “He <i>graded</i> the slope around the basement.”</p></div>`;
