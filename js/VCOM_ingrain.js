You may hate those daily algebra quizzes, but they <i>ingrain</i> a routine of reviewing some math every night.</p><p class="long">In the 14th century, this verb (originally spelled <i>engrain</i>) was used to mean "dye a fabric red with cochineal." It comes from the French <i>en graine</i>, where <i>graine</i> means "seed or berry," the source of a deep and permanent dye. To ingrain something is to fix it permanently, the way a great teacher ingrains good study habits in his students, or your distant friend's photo helps ingrain her face in your mind.</p></div></div>`;
