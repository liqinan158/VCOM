Rather than a circle, <i>planetary</i> motion takes us in an elliptical shape around the sun.</p><p class="long">In science, <i>planetary</i> usually describes the attributes or motion of planets. It's also used for anything that behaves in a similar way, like planetary electrons, which revolve around their atomic nucleus as if they were tiny planets.
