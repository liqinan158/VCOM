After this swift <i>once-over</i>, you'll probably order the pizza again, like you do every day.</p><p class="long"><i>Once-over</i> is an informal noun, a great way to describe any brief inspection, search, or examination. When you're signing a contract, it's smart to read it carefully rather than just giving it a once-over. But when you're choosing a piece of Halloween candy from the basket your neighbor is offering, it's fine to grab one after a once-over. This American English slang term was coined at the beginning of the twentieth century.</p></div></div>`;
