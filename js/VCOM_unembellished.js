You might prefer plain, <i>unembellished</i> sweaters — unlike your grandmother, who likes hers covered in pompoms, sequins, and beads.</p><p class="long">You can use this adjective for things that lack ornaments or frills, but it's also great for describing something that's straightforward and truthful. An unembellished story in the newspaper doesn't have any fancy flourishes or extra details — it simply tells it like it is. When reporters ask questions, they usually prefer an unembellished "yes" or "no," rather than a long, evasive response.</p></div></div>`;
