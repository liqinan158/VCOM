Figuratively, <i>newborn</i> describes anything recently born or created, like a <i>newborn</i> interest in vocabulary.</p><p class="long">Little babies are newborns until they're a month old — four weeks is the official human newborn cut-off age. Then they’re just regular ol’ babies. Other things can be newborn as long as they’re brand new — a newborn restaurant was opened recently, a newborn celebrity might be 18 but she just got famous. You could have a newborn fear if you recently became scared of something. Most newborns are not scary, though. (Unless you’re babysitting one.)</p></div></div>`;
