This means it beats quickly.</p><p class="long">To correctly pronounce <i>palpitate</i>, say: "PAL-pih-tate." Hearts aren't the only thing that can palpitate; your whole body might palpitate, or shiver. You can also palpitate something, such as what a medical professional does to a patient's heart to make it beat, potentially saving his or her life. <i>Palpitate</i> comes from the Latin word <i>palpare</i>, "to stroke."</p></div>`;
