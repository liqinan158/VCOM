Think of something you've done that was really, really embarrassing or dumb: now feel your face or take a look in the mirror as you <i>wince</i> at the uncomfortable memory.</p><p class="long">A moment of pain or a recollection of something painful can make you <i>wince.</i> It's hard not to have a physical response or a <i>wince</i> with a bad memory or a hurt. And <i>wince</i> is both a verb and a noun, so it can be an action or a result. Sometimes people donâ€™t do anything or have any physical pain, but they <i>wince</i> in discomfort at what someone else does or says, as when no one laughs after a really inappropriate joke.</p></div>`;
