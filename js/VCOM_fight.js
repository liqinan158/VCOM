Everyone disagrees from time to time, but it's sad when close friends <i>fight</i>.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>fight</i> means to engage in a struggle that involves conflict â€” and as a noun, <i>fight</i> is the conflict itself. A fight can take a physical form, like a boxing match or a playground skirmish, or it can happen with words, like a fight over politics. The ancient root of <i>fight</i> comes from the Proto-Indo-European prefix <i>pek</i>, meaning "to pluck out." Picture a hair-pulling <i>fight</i>, and this makes complete sense.</p></div>`;
