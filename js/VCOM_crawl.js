Before they learn to walk, most babies <i>crawl</i>.</p><p class="long">You might crawl around looking for a lost earring, or watch a spider crawl across your ceiling. The slow, creeping movement itself is a <i>crawl</i>, too: "Traffic was moving at a <i>crawl</i>." When your dog has fleas, he crawls with them, and if something gives you a creepy, prickling sensation, it makes your skin crawl. <i>Crawl</i> probably comes from the Old Norse <i>krafla</i>, "to claw one's way," which shares a root with <i>crab</i>.</p></div></div>`;
