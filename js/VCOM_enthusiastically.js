You might <i>enthusiastically</i> accept your grandmother's invitation to join her on a European cruise.</p><p class="long">If you love your job, you'll tend to work enthusiastically, and when your favorite band is playing, you'll wait enthusiastically for them to take the stage. <i>Enthusiastically</i> is a great adverb for describing anything you do cheerfully, or with <i>enthusiasm</i>. The adjective <i>enthusiastic</i> originally meant "possessed by a god," and it comes from the Greek word <i>entheos</i>, "divinely inspired or possessed," combining the roots <i>en</i>, "in," and <i>theos</i>, "god."</p></div>`;
