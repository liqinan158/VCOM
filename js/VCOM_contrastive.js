So, the adjective <i>contrastive</i> is used to describe things that differ from one another. Contrastive colors in a painting can create an interesting image, while contrasting personalities can spark a feud. In language, contrastive words show contrast between two parts of a sentence; words like <i>but</i> and <i>though</i> are examples.</p></div>`;
