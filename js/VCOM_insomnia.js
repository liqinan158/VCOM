If after a hot bath, a glass of warm milk, and hours of counting sheep, you still find yourself lying wide awake in bed, it's time to admit you have <i>insomnia</i>.</p><p class="long">There's no cure for insomnia, but people with insomnia are advised to go to bed at the same time every night and to try to avoid stress. The noun <i>insomnia</i> was borrowed from Latin <i>insomnis</i> "sleepless," from the prefix <i>in-</i>, "not," plus <i>somnus</i>, "sleep." <i>Somnus</i> is actually related to Greek <i>hypnos</i> "sleep," the source of English words such as <i>hypnosis</i> and <i>hypnotic</i>.</p></div></div>`;
