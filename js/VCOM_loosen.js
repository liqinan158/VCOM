A ballerina, for example, might <i>loosen</i> her tightly coiled hair after dance practice.</p><p class="long">You might need to loosen your belt after eating a huge meal, or loosen your collar and tie after a long day at work. Things sometimes also loosen on their own, like when a dog's collar loosens gradually until she can slip right out of it to chase a squirrel. There is also a figurative way to loosen things, making them less strict, like when a community loosens certain rules or laws.</p></div></div>`;
