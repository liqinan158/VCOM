As you can tell from these two examples, <i>available</i> means "not busy or not taken."</p><p class="long"><i>Available</i> can be used to describe anything that's ready to be used like a restaurant table or a theater seat. It can also be used to describe a person who is not involved in a romantic relationship: "<i>Available</i> singles use online dating websites." When you use a resource, like the school library, you can say that you "<i>avail</i> yourself to the research opportunities made <i>available</i> to students." No matter how you slice it, <i>available</i> means free for the taking.</p></div>`;
