If you study <i>poetics</i> in college, you'll read, talk, and think about a lot of literature.</p><p class="long"><i>Poetics</i> goes back to the Greek <i>poietikos</i>, "pertaining to poetry," or literally, "productive or creative." While <i>poetry</i> is evident in this word, you can use it  to describe a deep study of any kind of literary work. When it's capitalized, <i>Poetics</i> usually refers to the title of a work by the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, which is the earliest known Western work of literary theory.</p></div></div>`;
