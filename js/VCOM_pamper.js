You might <i>pamper</i> him by feeding him cubes of cheese and knitting him a little sweater and letting him sleep in your bed under the covers.</p><p class="long">Some people love to pamper their pets, cooking them special food and buying them expensive collars and toys. To <i>pamper</i> goes beyond kind treatment, bordering on overindulgence or coddling. People also like to pamper themselves from time to time, getting a massage or a manicure, or otherwise being treated indulgently. The word <i>pamper</i> originally meant "to cram with food," most likely from a Middle Dutch root meaning "to cram."</p></div></div>`;
