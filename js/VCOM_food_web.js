Together these interdependent organisms keep the food web in balance. The little guys give the big ones something to eat!</p><p class="long">The terms <i>food web</i> and <i>food chain</i> sound like the same thing, but don't be fooled; they aren't. While a food chain goes from top to bottom: hawk eats snake eats frog eats grasshopper eats grass, a food web shows the different ways these organisms are connected. A hawk might also eat a rabbit or a mouse or a frog. The job of a food web is to show how all these organisms are connected â€” not up and down like a chain, but all around like a web.</p></div></div>`;
