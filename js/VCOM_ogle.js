And if you're a cartoon character, you might also be drooling.</p><p class="long">Though it's most often used to refer to the way people gaze at each other, the verb <i>ogle</i> can also be used when talking about any object of desire â€” like when you ogle those designer jeans or that red Ferrari. The word comes from the 1680s German word <i>oeglen</i>, meaning "look at." Men are known to <i>ogle</i> women much more frequently than women <i>ogle</i> men. Ever seen a scene in a movie where a pretty lady walks into a bar and all the men turn on their bar stools to watch her pass by? That's classic <i>ogling</i>.</p></div></div>`;
