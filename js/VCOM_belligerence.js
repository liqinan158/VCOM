The <i>belligerence</i> of Roman gladiators made them excel in battle and instilled fear in their opponents.</p><p class="long">Belligerence in people is characterized by a tendency to pick fights or be aggressive toward others. It can be something in your nature, if you're, say, a bully, or it can be an attitude you summon in the heat of battle, as when you're going up against a rival sports team.
