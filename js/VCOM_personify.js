A person can also personify a value or emotion, as when the founder of a charitable organization is said to personify generosity and selflessness. When you add the suffix <i>-ify</i> (meaning "to make") to a noun, you "verbify" that noun. So <i>personify</i> means "to make into a person."</p></div></div>`;
