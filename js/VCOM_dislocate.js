var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">dislocate</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>dislocate</i> is to move something out of its correct or regular place, or disrupt it. When a family moves to a new town, it <i>dislocates</i> the kids, and if you throw a bowling ball, you might <i>dislocate</i> your shoulder.</p><p class="long">A hurricane can dislocate boats, beach homes, and sea creatures, and a football injury can also dislocate your shoulder â€” moving the bone out of the joint in which it normally sits. It's painful to dislocate a bone, and it can be painful in a different way when circumstances dislocate your life. The Latin root is <i>dislocare</i>, "put out of place," from <i>dis-</i>, "away," and <i>locare</i>, "to place."</p></div></div>`;
