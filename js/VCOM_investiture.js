The <i>investiture</i> of a king or queen involves an elaborate, lengthy ceremony.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>investiture</i> is good for describing the process of naming a judge or a church bishop, for example, to office. Investitures tend to include ritual ceremony and the symbolic transfer of a position from one person to the next. In the U.S., Supreme Court justices are <i>invested</i> with the position â€” which literally means "clothed in the official robes of office." Both words stem from the Latin <i>investire</i>, "clothe in" or "cover."</p></div>`;
