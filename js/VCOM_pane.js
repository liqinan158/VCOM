If you hit your baseball through your neighbors' kitchen window, you'll probably owe them a new <i>pane</i>.</p><p class="long">Panes are almost always made of glass, although occasionally they're some other translucent material. Stained-glass windows have colorful panes, and older houses with their original details often have windows made of many small glass panes. The original meaning of <i>pane</i> was "piece of a garment," from the Latin <i>pannum</i>, "piece of cloth." Later, a <i>pane</i> became "a panel of wood," and finally "a panel of glass."</p></div></div>`;
