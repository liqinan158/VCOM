It’s gallant bravery and strength, especially on the battlefield or in the face of danger. Saint George displayed <i>valor</i> when he finally slayed the dragon. It’s a trait fit for a hero.</p><p class="long"><i>Valor</i> comes from the Latin <i>valorem</i> for “strength, moral worth,” with the sense of “courage” added later. Valor is often displayed in the face of something designed to crush it, like a battle in a war, and it is often rewarded with the conferring of a medal. Valor is a word associated with war heroes and knights of yore, but anyone who faces death and doesn’t look away displays valor.</p></div></div>`;
