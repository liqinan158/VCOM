Typically <i>abash</i> is used when something has a shaming effect. You might find yourself saying: “I was <i>abashed</i> by the magnitude of the others’ generosity so I donated twenty thousand more,” but you wouldn’t just use <i>abash</i> in place of embarrass. It would sound strange to warn, “Don’t do that, you’re going to <i>abash</i> yourself!”</p></div></div>`;
