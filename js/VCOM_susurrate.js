There's nothing more relaxing than sitting outside on a summer night listening to the leaves <i>susurrate</i> overhead.</p><p class="long">This verb is almost always used in a literary context, so you're most likely to find it in a poem describing the way a field of tall grass susurrates on a breezy spring day. You can also use it to mean a breathy whisper, like when the librarian susurrates, "Shh! You're in the library!" <i>Susurrate</i> comes from the Latin <i>susurrus</i>, "a murmur or whisper," which stems from an imitative root meaning "to buzz or whisper."</p></div>`;
