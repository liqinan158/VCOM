Most people are more likely to <i>slouch</i> when they're tired or bored.</p><p class="long">You might tend to slouch in math class but sit up straight and tall when your favorite art teacher invites you to enter a piece in an art show. Your math class posture can itself be described as a <i>slouch</i> as well. Yet another meaning of <i>slouch</i> is a person who's lazy or useless â€” this is actually the word's original definition, from the 1500's. It's thought to be rooted in the Old Norse word <i>slokr</i>, "lazy fellow."</p></div></div>`;
