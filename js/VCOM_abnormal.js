It essentially means “not normal,” or "unusual.” <i>Abnormal</i> implies that whatever is “not normal” is also undesirable. However, <i>abnormal</i> is sometimes used in a positive context. The phrase “<i>abnormal</i> intelligence,” for instance, usually refers to someone with especially high intelligence.</p></div></div>`;
