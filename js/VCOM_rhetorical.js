If you went to school a hundred years ago, your English class would have been called <i>Rhetoric</i>. But nowadays if we say something is rhetorical, we usually mean that it’s only good for talking. If you speak beautifully about carpentry but can’t ever actually build a cabinet, we might say you have lots of rhetorical flare, but very little real skill.</p></div></div>`;
