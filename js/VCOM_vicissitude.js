No one can escape the <i>vicissitudes</i> of life.</p><p class="long">While <i>vicissitude</i> comes from the Latin <i>vicis</i>, which means "change" and technically can mean a change of any kind, you'll find that <i>vicissitude</i> is almost always used to talk about an unfortunate event or circumstance. Losing a pet, crashing the car, being called in for jury duty: these are examples of vicissitudes â€” chapters in one's life that one would rather avoid but must get through. Some lives have more vicissitudes than others, to be sure, but no life is without events that test and challenge us.</p></div></div>`;
