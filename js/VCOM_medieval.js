A teacher once rapped your knuckles with a ruler as punishment? That’s practically <i>medieval</i>!</p><p class="long"><i>Medieval</i> can also have positive connotations, since the Middle Ages are remembered as a time of knights and courtly love, when chivalry and honor were highly valued. If a guy doesn’t mind getting his feet wet lifting his girlfriend over a big puddle, that’s medieval in a nice way. However, if he then dies of the bubonic plague, that’s medieval in a less nice way.</p></div>`;
