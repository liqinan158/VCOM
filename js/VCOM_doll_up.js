If you <i>doll up</i> your friend for the prom, you might curl her hair and do her makeup.</p><p class="long">You can doll up yourself by primping before a special event â€” dressing carefully, applying lipstick, styling your hair, or wearing jewelry. Children sometimes doll up their stuffed animals by putting them in doll clothes, and you can also doll up a room by decorating it with wallpaper, pillows, slipcovers, and accessories. When you doll someone up, you dress them almost as if they were an actual doll.</p></div></div>`;
