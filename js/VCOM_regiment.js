If you ever need to assign troops to a <i>regiment</i>, you might say something like, “Next week I will <i>regiment</i> the ground forces arriving from North Dakota.” The verb form can also be used in a more general sense to describe any action that is characterized by strict order or control: "Her diet is strictly <i>regimented</i> to include only Sugar Babies."</p></div></div>`;
