var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">bulbous</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Something that's <i>bulbous</i> is round or bulging. If you hit your head on the edge of your locker, you may end up with a tender, <i>bulbous</i> lump.</p><p class="long">While anything that has the shape of a bulb — like an onion or a light bulb — can be described as <i>bulbous</i>, it almost always describes someone's nose. It's not very nice to tell your friend he has a bulbous nose, though it may be accurate. You can also call a plant <i>bulbous</i> if it's grown from a bulb. This is the earliest, 16th century use of the word, while the "bulb-shaped" meaning came along about 200 years later.</p></div>`;
