And when you <i>unleash</i> a storm of insults against your brother, you allow them to flow freely from your lips.</p><p class="long">There are two ways to use the verb <i>unleash</i>. Literally, it means "set loose," like when a police officer unleashes her trained dog to sniff luggage for illegal drugs, or a farmer unleashes her llama after moving it into a pen. Figuratively, you can unleash all kinds of emotions, forces, opinions, and actions. Unhappy citizens might unleash a series of high-profile protests, or a barrage of shouted demands, for example.</p></div>`;
