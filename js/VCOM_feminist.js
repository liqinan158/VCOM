If your brother objects strongly to women being paid less than men for doing the same job, he's probably a <i>feminist</i>.</p><p class="long">If you believe that women should have the same political, social, and economic rights as men, you are a feminist. It has absolutely nothing to do with putting down men or boys in order to elevate the status of women. The word <i>feminist</i> comes from <i>feminism</i>, which originally meant simply "being feminine," or "being a woman," but gained the meaning "advocacy of women's rights" in the late 1800s.</p></div>`;
