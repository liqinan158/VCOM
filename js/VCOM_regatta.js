In a <i>regatta</i>, yachts or sailboats usually participate, but some regattas focus on rowboats or powerboats.</p><p class="long">In the 1650s, <i>regatta</i> related to a boat race among gondoliers, held on the Grand Canal in Venice. The Italian word <i>regatta</i> means "contention for mastery" and comes from the Latin word <i>regattare</i>, or "to compete, haggle, sell at retail." <i>Regatta</i> came to specifically mean "boat race" — and the many social events related to it — in the late 1700s.</p></div>`;
