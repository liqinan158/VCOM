In the equation that measures friction, for example, the number that always stays the same is the <i>coefficient</i>.</p><p class="long">In plain English, <i>coefficient</i> means "joining together to produce a result." Sometimes people use the word to talk about social phenomena, like the coefficient factors of vanity and self-loathing in a celebrity's alcoholic demise. But mostly you'll encounter it in math and science. In algebra, the coefficient is the number that you multiply a variable by, like the 4 in 4x=y.  In chemistry, when you see a number in front of a chemical like 2H2o, you're looking at the coefficient.</p></div></div>`;
