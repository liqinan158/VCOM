Similarly, the word <i>partially</i> refers to a part of something only. A partially brick house is not all brick. Anything that is partially true is only true to some degree, like if you tell someone you’re in a band, but really you just carry the guitars. This word means about the same as <i>partly</i>, and the opposite word would be <i>wholly</i> or <i>entirely</i>.</p></div>`;
