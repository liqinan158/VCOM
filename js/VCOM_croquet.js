It was all the rage in Europe in the 1800s, but people still play it worldwide, often at summer parties.</p><p class="long">When you play croquet, you have a colored wooden ball and a matching mallet. Players take turns trying to hit their balls under a series of hoops or to knock someone else’s out of the way. When Alice is in Wonderland, the Queen of Hearts uses a flamingo as a mallet and a hedgehog for a ball, but that is not recommended. In Northern French dialect, <i>croquet</i> means "hockey stick," originally "shepherd's crook" in Old North French.</p></div></div>`;
