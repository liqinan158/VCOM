If you write your story in the style of Ernest Hemingway, your English teacher may accuse you of <i>slavish</i> imitation.</p><p class="long">In a dictatorship, rulers may expect citizens to be slavish, but in a democracy, no one should have to treat leaders in a slavish way. This meaning of <i>slavish</i> is the original 16th century one, from <i>slave</i>, "person who is the property of another person." The "servilely imitative, lacking originality or independence" meaning of <i>slavish</i> came later, around 1750.</p></div></div>`;
