While you can use the adjective <i>openhanded</i> for many kinds of generosity, it's used most often to refer specifically to money and a person's willingness to part with it. The word has been around since about 1600, and it can be spelled with a hyphen or as two words — <i>open handed</i> — as well as one.</p></div></div>`;
