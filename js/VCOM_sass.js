Your middle school teacher might warn you that once you get to high school, they won't put up with your <i>sass</i>.</p><p class="long">Use <i>sass</i> as a noun â€” or a verb, meaning to talk in a cheeky way: "Don't you dare <i>sass</i> your grandmother!" When someone teases you or speaks in an almost rude manner, they give you sass. This word emerged in the 19th century from the adjective <i>sassy</i>, which began as a variation on <i>saucy</i>, from the idea that words can be zesty, sharp, or spicy.</p></div>`;
