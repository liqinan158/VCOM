Major <i>dignitaries</i> from other countries might get to meet the President when they visit the U.S.</p><p class="long">If you see the word <i>dignity</i> in <i>dignitary</i>, it gives you a clue to its meaning. When we treat people with dignity, we're treating them with respect. Dignitaries get a lot of respect, because they're important and powerful people in their country â€” heads of state, ambassadors, and royalty are all dignitaries. It's not easy to become a dignitary: you'd better either be born into the right family or become a powerful person in some other way.</p></div></div>`;
