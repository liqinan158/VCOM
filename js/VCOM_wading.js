If you forget your bathing suit when you go to the lake, <i>wading</i> is a fun way to spend the day.</p><p class="long">You can think of wading as a low-commitment alternative to swimming, since it doesn't require special gear and you won't even get your hair wet. Wading is a perfect activity on a hot day, and you can do it in a river, at the seashore, or in your own backyard, if you have a wading pool, a shallow, child-sized container of water. Just roll up your pants and step right in!</p></div>`;
