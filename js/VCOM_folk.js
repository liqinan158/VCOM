You could say that folks in New York seem more accepting of your eccentricities than the folks back home in your small town. You can also refer to your parents as your folks, or use it as an informal, friendly form of address: "Hi, <i>folks</i>! I'll be your waiter today." The Old English root is <i>folc</i>, "common people, nation, or troop."</p></div>`;
