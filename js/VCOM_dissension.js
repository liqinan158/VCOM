There is often <i>dissension</i> between labor unions and governments vying for funds, or even between siblings â€” vying for attention.</p><p class="long">A <i>dissension</i> is a disagreement, or difference of opinion, and the meaning hasn't changed since the word first came into use in French in about the 12th century. Sometimes a dissension is simply a brief and easily resolved disagreement, and at other times it might last for thousands of years. People in the Balkans have had centuries of religious dissension, alternating with periods of peaceable coexistence.</p></div></div>`;
