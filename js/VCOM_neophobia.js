Your <i>neophobia</i> might keep you from moving out of your dark, cramped apartment into a new house.</p><p class="long">People with neophobia have deep anxiety and fear associated with any experience or thing that's new. If your grandmother seems scared to learn how to use a computer, it may be because of neophobia. The word is often used by biologists who study animals, too: the behavior of certain birds tends to be affected by neophobia. The word itself combines <i>neo</i>, or "new" in Greek, and <i>phobos</i>, or "fear."</p></div></div>`;
