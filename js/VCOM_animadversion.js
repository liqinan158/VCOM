You don't hear it very often, but in Puritan times, dressing in bright colors and swearing would bring many <i>animadversions</i> down upon you.</p><p class="long"><i>Animadversion</i> comes from the verb <i>animadvert</i>. In Middle English, <i>animadvert</i> meant simply to pay attention — to "turn your mind to" something, from the Latin <i>animus</i> ("mind") + <i>ad-</i> ("to") + <i>vertere</i> ("turn"). Anyone with parents can understand how a word that means "pay attention" can turn into a word that means "criticize."</p></div></div>`;
