If you <i>crenellate</i> the cardboard towers, your model of a medieval castle will look more realistic.</p><p class="long">Imagine a protective wall surrounding a castle, and the notches cut in that wall that can be used to watch for approaching troops and, if necessary, fire at them. The notches themselves are called <i>crenels</i> or <i>embrasures</i>, and the process of installing them is crenellating. The word stems from the Latin <i>cren</i> (also the root of "cranny"), which means "notch."</p></div></div>`;
