Less literally, it indicates something with two opposing but related qualities. You might visualize <i>polarity</i> as a battery holder with a plus sign on one end and a negative on the other. More than just opposites, <i>polarity</i> suggests opposites that are interconnected. What would the light of day be without the dark of night? Good without evil? Yin without Yang?</p></div></div>`;
