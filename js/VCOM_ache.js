var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">ache</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">An <i>ache</i> is a dull, lingering pain. An <i>ache</i> in your calves after your morning jog might mean you didn't stretch enough before you started running.</p><p class="long">You might describe your discomfort as a head ache or a stomach ache â€” in either case, there's a throbbing or continuous pain. A non-physical hurt can also be called an <i>ache</i>, and you can use the word as a verb in either case: "It feels like my heart will <i>ache</i> forever, since my sweet cat died." The Old English root is <i>acan</i>, "to suffer pain," possibly from an imitative Proto-Indo-European word that sounds like a groan.</p></div>`;
