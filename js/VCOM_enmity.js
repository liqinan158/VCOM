If you're a football fanatic, you feel <i>enmity</i> for your opposing team.</p><p class="long"><i>Enmity</i> comes from the same Latin root as <i>enemy</i>, and means the state of being an enemy. If you have always hated someone, you have a history of enmity with that person. <i>Enmity</i> is stronger than <i>antagonism</i> or <i>animosity</i>, which imply competitive feeling but don't go all the way to enemy status. Hopefully you are a peacemaker and don't experience too much enmity in your life.</p></div>`;
