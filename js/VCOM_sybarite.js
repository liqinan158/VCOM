Unless she's inviting you over for champagne brunches and showering you with gifts — in which case you should keep your mouth shut.</p><p class="long"><i>Sybarite</i> was first recorded in the 1600s, meaning a “person devoted to pleasure.” The literal translation of this noun is “inhabitant of Sybaris,” which was an ancient Greek town full of citizens who loved nice things. Today, the word still has the same two meanings: it's either a person who could be described as addicted to pleasures and luxury (like a <i>hedonist</i>), or an actual person who lives in Sybaris.</p></div></div>`;
