Use the word <i>scarce</i> when you want to say that something is hard to find or practically missing. When you know you’re about to be asked to do something unpleasant, like wash the dishes or take out the trash, go ahead and “make yourself <i>scarce</i>,” which means to be elusive or get out of there fast.</p></div>`;
