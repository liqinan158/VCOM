But <i>shed</i> is also a verb meaning "to cast off," like when a snake sheds its skin.  If your couch is covered in fur, it might be because your dog is shedding.  You can shed non-physical things, like a bad habit.  Does your cat shed?  If so, maybe I should sleep in the shed since I'm allergic.</p></div>`;
