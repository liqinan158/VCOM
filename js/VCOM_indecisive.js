When you finally do make a decision, you may not be confident about it, or you might change your mind.</p><p class="long">Another definition for <i>indecisive</i> is not definitely settling something, like when election results are too close to call or some result has been called into question. Several historic American elections have had this happen in the recent past, and in that case, the election result remains indecisive until a recount has been finished or until one party gives a concession speech.</p></div></div>`;
