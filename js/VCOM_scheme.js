It's going to take a really solid <i>scheme</i>, probably involving teleportation or some sort of temporary cloning, to make an appearance at both parties at once.</p><p class="long"><i>Scheme</i> comes to us from the Latin word for "figure." And it's still used today to refer to a set of drawings and figures used to map out something. Or maybe you’ve heard people talk about something in the <i>scheme</i> of life." In that case they're talking about something that fits into the bigger picture. But don't forget that <i>schemes</i> often carry a negative connotation — the word brings to mind devious plans and secret plots organized by scheming bad guys.</p></div>`;
