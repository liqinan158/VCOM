You might experience <i>heartburn</i> after eating twelve slices of pizza for dinner.</p><p class="long">People with a tendency to get heartburn often start to feel a painful sensation after they eat. Heartburn can begin as an acidic feeling in your stomach that moves up into your upper chest. It happens when gastric acid is regurgitated into the esophagus, and it can also be called "acid indigestion." The original, thirteenth century meaning of <i>heartburn</i> was "lust," but by the fifteenth century it had come to have today's meaning of "indigestion."</p></div>`;
