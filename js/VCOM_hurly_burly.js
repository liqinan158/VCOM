There’s the <i>hurly burly</i> of the schoolyard, or the <i>hurly burly</i> of a food fight. When there’s a <i>hurly burly</i>, things have gone totally higgledy-piggledy.</p><p class="long">When something loud, unruly, or chaotic is going on, there’s a hurly burly. It’s an old-fashioned British word. In fact, a witch in Shakespeare’s <i>Macbeth</i> says, “When the <i>hurlyburly</i>’s done, When the battle’s lost and won.” A hurly burly isn’t always as serious as war, though, it’s an informal word for a disturbance, hoo-ha, kerfuffle, a real to-do, the kind that wouldn’t be welcome in a library. Any hurly burly is noisy in some way.</p></div></div>`;
