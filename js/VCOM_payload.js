If you have a plane with a <i>payload</i> of one ton, then that plane can carry one ton (including you and the snacks you may bring aboard).</p><p class="long">Often, payload is estimated to be everything on board a vehicle that's worth money, or that produces income for the vehicle's owner. In the case of a commercial jet, that might be all the paying passengers. In other cases, a truck, ship, or plane's payload includes every single person and item on board, including the flight crew and fuel. From about 1936, <i>payload</i> frequently referred to bombs carried by a military plane or missile.</p></div>`;
