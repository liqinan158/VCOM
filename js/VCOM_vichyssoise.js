If you're hungry for something other than salad on a hot summer day, you should try making some <i>vichyssoise</i>.</p><p class="long">The history of this soup is uncertain. One story attributes it to the French king Louis XV, who was terrified of being poisoned and ordered so many people to taste his soup that by the time he ate, it had grown cold. The cook Julia Child insisted it was an American invention, and a New York hotel's French-born chef claimed to have created it in 1917, using a name inspired by his hometown of <i>Vichy</i> in France.</p></div></div>`;
