Many Irish <i>emigrants</i> came to the United States in the late 1800s.</p><p class="long">The Latin root of <i>emigrant</i> is <i>emigrationem</i>, which means "removal from a place." Don't confuse <i>emigrant</i> with <i>immigrant</i>, which tells about the person's status in the new country. When you leave your native land, you are an emigrant, and when you are already settled in a new country, you are an immigrant. It's a subtle difference, but with an emigrant, the focus is more on the home country.</p></div>`;
