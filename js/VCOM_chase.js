This activity is called a <i>chase</i>. Dogs <i>chase</i> cats, cats <i>chase</i> mice, and mice are in big trouble.</p><p class="long">The word <i>chase</i> tried to run away from the Old French word <i>chacier</i> for "to hunt or strive for,” but we caught it. Any time you’re trying to get something that’s trying to get away from you, you chase it. Police officers chase criminals, and kids playing tag chase each other all over the yard. You can also chase things that aren't physical, like a dream or a goal. This activity itself is called a chase.</p></div></div>`;
