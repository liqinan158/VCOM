When your doctor tells you that you need a flu shot, she wants to <i>inject</i> you with a vaccine that will help keep you from getting sick.</p><p class="long">You are most likely to hear the verb <i>inject</i> at the doctor's office. Veterinarians inject dogs each year with rabies vaccines, and sometimes if you're sick enough, a doctor or nurse might need to inject you with antibiotics. You can use <i>inject</i> in a figurative way, too: "I'd like to <i>inject</i> a new topic into this conversation, it's getting so boring." The Latin root is <i>inicere</i>, "to throw in" or "to throw on."</p></div></div>`;
