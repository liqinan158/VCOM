It’s that period of not quite dark and not quite light, right after sunset.</p><p class="long">Night is dark, while day is light (as long as it’s not cloudy). Then there are times when it’s mixed: like crepuscule. Crepuscule is a time of partial darkness, as the sun has just set. This in-between time is also called dusk. In fact, English is blessed with many words that mean dusk — such as <i>evenfall, gloam, gloaming,</i> and <i>nightfall</i> — but when you want to set a poetic tone, <i>crepuscule</i> (which comes from Latin) is hard to beat.</p></div></div>`;
