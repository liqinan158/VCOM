In fact, <i>salsa</i> — which is rooted in the Latin <i>salsa</i>, "salty food" or "condiment" — means "sauce" in both Spanish and Italian. There is also a genre of music called <i>salsa</i>, which gets its name from the implied "spiciness" of the sauce, as well as the blending of Cuban and Puerto Rican styles of dance music.</p></div>`;
