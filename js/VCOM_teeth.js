Don't forget to brush your <i>teeth</i> before bed. (You should also floss, while you're at it.)</p><p class="long">Many animals have teeth, from herbivores like cows to carnivores like wolves and lions that use their sharp teeth to tear meat (as well as for hunting and to defend themselves). Humans get two full sets of teeth in their lifetime â€” first baby teeth that fall out and then the adult teeth that replace them. Other animals, like sharks, regularly grow new sets to replace worn teeth.</p></div></div>`;
