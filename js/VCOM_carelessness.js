Don't try to text a friend while you're riding your bike, or your <i>carelessness</i> may send you crashing into a mailbox.</p><p class="long">You can think of carelessness as negligence, a failure to pay close attention or carefully consider the possible ramifications of your actions. Driver carelessness causes many traffic accidents, and a writer's carelessness can result in grammatical errors and misspellings. The Old English version of this word, <i>carleasnes</i>, meant "freedom from anxiety," something closer to <i>nonchalance</i> than today's <i>carelessness</i>.</p></div>`;
