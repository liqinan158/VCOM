That sick feeling in your stomach after you meanly told your younger brother the truth about Santa Claus? That might be your <i>conscience</i> bothering you.</p><p class="long">The word <i>conscience</i> contains the word <i>science</i>, which comes from the Latin word <i>scientia</i>, meaning "to know" or "knowledge." You can think of your conscience as your knowledge of yourself, especially when it comes to your own morals, or your feelings about right and wrong. Pangs of conscience, which feel like an uncomfortable inner voice, are helpful when you're trying to decide the right thing to do in a particular situation.</p></div>`;
