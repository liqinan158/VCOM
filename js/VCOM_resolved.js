If you've made a <i>resolved</i> decision, it won't be easy to change your mind.</p><p class="long">You can also use this adjective to mean "answered," like a resolved equation in math class or a resolved dilemma that's finally been settled. More often, you'll use it to mean  "with resolve," or "with purpose." You'll be more intimidated by a debate opponent who has a resolved expression on her face than one who looks uncertain. <i>Resolved</i> comes from the verb <i>resolve</i>, which means "determine," but originally meant "melt or dissolve."</p></div>`;
