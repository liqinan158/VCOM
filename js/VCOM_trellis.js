The purpose of the trellis is to support climbing plants, which can't stand straight like a tree or houseplant. With the aid of the trellis, the climbing plant wraps around the trellis and adds decoration to a garden. Sometimes <i>trellis</i> is used as a metaphor for other kinds of support.</p></div>`;
