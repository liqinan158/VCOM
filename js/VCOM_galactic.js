The very middle of our galaxy can be called the <i>galactic</i> center.</p><p class="long">When something's described as <i>galactic</i>, it usually has something to do with astronomy. The adjective is good for talking about the characteristics of our galaxy, or specifying that something exists within our galaxy. <i>Galactic</i> can also be used informally to simply mean huge: "Did you see the size of their house? It's <i>galactic</i>!" The word, along with <i>galaxy</i>, comes from the Greek phrase <i>galaxias kyklos</i>, "milky circle."</p></div>`;
