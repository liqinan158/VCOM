There are specific rules for the musical composition of a <i>melody</i>, and most fall into regular patterns.</p><p class="long">The ancient Greek word <i>melōidía</i> was used to denote a tune for lyric poetry. It was derived from <i>melos</i>, which meant "song." In most songs, the melody follows a logical, mathematical pattern that creates a memorable line of notes. The word suggests a beautiful and pleasant sound, as was celebrated in the 1946 Irving Berlin lyrics, "A pretty girl is like a <i>melody</i> that haunts you night and day."</p></div>`;
