The word for our popular holiday Halloween is a shortened form of "All Hallows' Eve," or "All Saints' Eve," which precedes All Saints' Day. In the verb form, the synonyms <i>bless</i> and <i>sanctify</i> are more commonly used these days, but <i>hallow</i> still appears in such phrases as "hallowed ground" (ground that's been blessed) and the Christian "hallowed be Thy name" (a phrase from "The Lord's Prayer," where <i>hallowed</i> means "revered").</p></div>`;
