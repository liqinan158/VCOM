Your mom's request that you come to a family dinner might be <i>interlarded</i> with references to how often lately you've been out with friends.</p><p class="long">Are you wondering about seeing <i>lard</i> inside <i>interlard</i>? In the 15th century, <i>interlard</i> came into English from Middle French, where it meant to "mix with alternate layers of fat." Yum, right? :-) Maybe not, but important to remember, as interlarded speech or writing is well-greased in a figurative way. Think of your math teacher's lessons interlarded with jokes from <i>The Simpsons</i> :-) or a word-learning blurb interlarded with smiles :-).</p></div></div>`;
