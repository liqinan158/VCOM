Most people <i>windsurf</i> for fun, although it's also an Olympic sport.</p><p class="long">A sailboard is a cross between a surfboard and a small sailboat, and windsurfers incorporate the best of both surfing and sailing into their sport. Most windsurfers credit an American inventor, Newman Darby, with the creation of the first sailboard in 1964. He and his wife Naomi became the first windsurfers when they tested the board on Pennsylvania's Susquehanna River. Windsurfers first competed in the Olympics in 1984.</p></div>`;
