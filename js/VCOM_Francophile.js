If you start wearing a beret and carrying a baguette around with you, your friends will assume you're a <i>Francophile</i>.</p><p class="long">Francophiles have a special appreciation for all things French: they might admire the language, envy the country's inhabitants, or prefer to buy food that's made in France. If you're a Francophile who's never traveled to France, you can save your money for this purpose, in the meantime learning to speak French and dining on Brie and Champagne whenever you can. <i>Francophile</i> combines <i>Franco-</i>, "French," and <i>-phile</i>, "one that loves."</p></div></div>`;
