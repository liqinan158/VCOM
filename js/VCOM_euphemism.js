These days we tend to use euphemisms when talking about anything having to do with elimination of bodily waste: <i>toilet</i>, <i>bathroom</i>, and <i>water closet</i> were all originally euphemisms. The military is also notorious for using euphemisms, like saying "neutralizing the target" instead of "killing someone."</p></div>`;
