Many acts of terrorism fall into this category, coming from extreme interpretations of religious law or even psychological problems. Other kinds of terrorism are purely political, or for personal gain. The noun <i>theoterrorism</i> combines the Greek <i>theos</i>, or god, and <i>terrorism</i>, with its Latin root of <i>terror</i>, "great fear or dread."</p></div></div>`;
