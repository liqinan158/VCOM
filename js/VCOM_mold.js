When the food or material sets, it will keep the shape of the mold. If you pour red and blue gelatin into molds shaped like stars, you'll have a great patriotic dessert for the Fourth of July. As a verb, <i>mold</i> can mean to influence. Good teachers mold their students' interests and passions.</p></div>`;
