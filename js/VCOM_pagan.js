Today, <i>pagan</i> is used to describe someone who doesn't go to synagogue, church, or mosque. It could be that they worship several gods at once, or they have no interest in a god at all. Religious people sometimes use <i>pagan</i> as a put-down to describe the unreligious as godless and uncivilized.</p></div></div>`;
