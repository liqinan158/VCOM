If you love your basketball coach so much that you build her an altar and bow whenever she walks by, thatâ€™s <i>deification</i>. And a little weird.</p><p class="long">This word is a variation of <i>deify</i> which means to treat someone like a deity (a god). Deification is treating a mere mortal as someone godly. Often, this word is used negatively. For example, enthusiastic fans of someone could be accused of deification by non-fans. Someone must be considered extremely impressive to be the object of deification. This word is related to Latin <i>deus</i> (god).</p></div>`;
