Your mail carrier delivering a postcard and your gossipy friend calling to give you the latest news can each be described as a <i>messenger</i>.</p><p class="long">Delivering messages for others is certainly a time-honored profession, since even the gods of Antiquity needed someone to do it â€” the Greeks had Hermes and the Romans had Mercury as their messenger gods. A messenger carries a message, and that's where the word itself comes from: the Latin root of <i>message</i> is <i>missus</i>, which means "a sending away, sending, dispatching" and is the past participle of mittere, "send."</p></div></div>`;
