On a hot summer day, you might relax outside in a lawn chair, <i>languidly</i> sipping a glass of lemonade and watching the clouds drift by.</p><p class="long">The adverb <i>languidly</i> comes from the Latin word <i>languere</i>, meaning "be weak or faint." When you do something such as run or climb stairs languidly, you probably do appear weak or sluggish. The word has a peaceful and relaxed connotation, however  â€” if you do something languidly you aren't trying very hard and you aren't worrying much about it. You may chat languidly with your friends on a summer day while sipping tea on the patio.</p></div>`;
