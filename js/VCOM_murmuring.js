And anyone or anything that makes such a sound can also be described as <i>murmuring</i>, like the <i>murmuring</i> audience in the theater just before the play begins.</p><p class="long">Some murmuring is discontented or complaining, similar to the word <i>muttering</i>: "Restless murmuring filled the room as the best man's wedding speech dragged on longer than anyone expected."  We can trace <i>murmuring</i> all the way back to a root, <i>mor-mor</i>, that it shares with the Sanskrit <i>murmurah</i>, "crackling fire," and the Greek <i>mormyrein</i>, "to roar."</p></div></div>`;
