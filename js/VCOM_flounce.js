var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">flounce</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>flounce</i> is to move in an exaggerated, emphatic way, especially if your movement expresses anger or impatience. A young child who doesn't like what's for dinner might stand up and <i>flounce</i> away from the table.</p><p class="long">If you feel you've been misunderstood, you might need to stifle the urge to flounce off in a huff â€” it's more mature to stay and try to explain yourself. <i>Flounce</i> is also a noun, meaning both the action of flouncing and a ruffle: "I'll make this dress look fancier by sewing a <i>flounce</i> on the bottom." The huffy movement meaning came first, possibly from a Scandinavian source.</p></div></div>`;
