If you write "don't forget lunch" on your arm every morning, it means you need a <i>reminder</i> to grab your brown paper bag on your way out the door.</p><p class="long">A <i>reminder</i> helps you remember, whether it's an appointment, an acquaintance's name, or a grocery list. You can give yourself a reminder, or write one to another person who's prone to forgetting details. The word's been around since the 1650s, and it came from <i>remind</i>, which originally meant "to remember." Later, <i>remind</i> came to mean "to make someone remember," or "to put someone in mind of something."</p></div>`;
