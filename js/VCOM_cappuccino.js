You might order a <i>cappuccino</i> at your favorite neighborhood cafe.</p><p class="long">Cappuccino is one of dozens of drink choices at any coffee shop that has an espresso machine. While many of these drinks were invented in the US within the last five or ten years, cappuccino is authentically Italian, traditionally served in a fairly small cup and made with equal parts strong espresso, steamed milk, and dense milk foam. The word itself comes from the brown color of the hoods worn by Capuchin monks in Italy.</p></div></div>`;
