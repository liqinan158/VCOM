If you are rich enough to buy a TV network, a record company, several newspapers, and a radio station, you too can own a media <i>conglomerate</i>.</p><p class="long">The root of <i>conglomerate</i> is <i>glomus</i>, a Latin word for “ball.” So think of a conglomerate as a bunch of different things balled together. Before it came to describe giant corporations, a <i>conglomerate </i> was a rock formed from different kinds of minerals. <i>Conglomerate</i> can also be used as a verb — like when your media companies conglomerated successfully.</p></div></div>`;
