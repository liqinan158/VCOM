It's an adjective used to describe something that doesn't offer enough, as in "farmers having a <i>scanty</i> crop in a drought year."</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>scanty</i> comes from the Old Norse <i>scamt</i>, which means "short or brief," and so suggests a small amount. The word usually suggests a meager amount, and can refer to anything that is barely sufficient. Someone trying to stretch a meal might offer scanty servings. On a humorous note, a Roaring Twenties flapper referred to her underwear as <i>scanties</i>.</p></div></div>`;
