But in the early 13th century, <i>conjure</i> was a bit more sinister â€” it meant using a spell to capture a demon to do one's bidding. In our modern day, <i>conjure</i> still carries the meaning of summoning a spirit, but it more regularly means to summon an idea or bring something into existence.</p></div>`;
