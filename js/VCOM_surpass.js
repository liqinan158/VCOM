While you could just say <i>passed</i> or even <i>outdid</i>" saying <i>surpass</i> seems to indicate that a person (or some other thing that performs, like a company) has really gone beyond anything you anticipated. People tend to use this word a lot before the words <i>expectations</i> and <i>predictions</i> among others, because of course <i>surpassing</i> is all about "<i>surpassing</i> something."</p></div></div>`;
