Not like the kind a witch puts on someone, but close. More like what the schoolyard bully says to hurt someone’s feelings. On purpose. <i>Malediction</i> has <i>male</i> in it, but it’s not a slur against men or boys. <i>Mal</i> comes from the Latin for "evil" and "diction," and as you may remember, has to do with what we say. So a <i>malediction</i> is an evil statement directed at someone else. Pretty nasty, if you ask me.</p></div>`;
