Every two years with words similar to these, the Olympic games officially begin. To <i>proclaim</i> is to exclaim or declare.</p><p class="long">When you proclaim something, you are saying it loud and clear and in public. A doctor can proclaim you healthy after you have recovered from a long illness. The panel of judges may have trouble proclaiming the winner in a very tight race. What you are saying out loud can be called a proclamation. Proclamations were once only made by Kings or other ruling leaders which is why the word <i>proclaim</i> has an official feeling to it.</p></div></div>`;
