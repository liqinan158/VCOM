It can also mean really marvelous and fantastic — or really awful and terrible.</p><p class="long">We often use <i>tremendous</i> if something is super wonderful. If someone comes into your office and tells you you just won a big contract and are getting a huge bonus, you might exclaim, “Tremendous!” <i>Tremendous</i> comes from the Latin for "trembling," and is connected with fear. Something tremendous can be big in a terrifying way, like the tremendous noise of an approaching hurricane, or a tremendous tidal wave about to crash on the shore.</p></div>`;
