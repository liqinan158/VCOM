If you go see a movie about a jewel thief, the topic is not <i>subjective</i>.

That Earth has one moon is objective — it's a fact. Whether the moon is pretty or not is subjective — not everyone will agree. Facts are objective, but opinions are subjective. What's the best song, band, movie, or TV show? These are all very subjective issues. There's no right answer.</p></div></div>`;
