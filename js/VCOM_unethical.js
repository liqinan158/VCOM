But if you stole that cookie and then lied about it, that would be morally wrong, or <i>unethical</i>.</p><p class="long">The prefix <i>un-</i> means "not," so something or someone who's <i>unethical</i> is literally "not ethical." In other words, that someone is lacking principles or morals. Because being unethical involves going against social or professional expectations of what's right, it's a word that's often used to describe bad behavior or immoral conduct. So like the great philosophers, you can decide if Cookie Monster has an <i>ethics</i> problem â€” or just bad eating habits.</p></div></div>`;
