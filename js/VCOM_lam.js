If you see a bully making little kids cry, you may be tempted to <i>lam</i> him in the nose and then <i>lam</i> before he can retaliate.</p><p class="long">The British slang meaning of <i>lam</i>, "hit or beat," is the oldest one, dating from the 16th century. It stems from an Old Norse root that means "to beat" or "to make lame." The newer, North American definition, "escape," can also be used as a noun: "After he stole his cousin's car he went on the lam." Experts trace this meaning back to slang used by pickpockets.</p></div>`;
