Watching kids at a birthday party furiously grabbing for candy from a piñata, you might find yourself surprised at their <i>greed</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Greed</i> is often connected with money, a desire to acquire as much of it as possible, but it can refer to that kind of urge toward anything, like food or material possessions. When you see greed, it's an ugly thing, whether you're observing a greedy person or the greed of a huge company that treats its workers badly in order to make more money. <i>Greed</i> comes from the Old English <i>grædig</i>, or "voracious," which means "always hungry for more."</p></div>`;
