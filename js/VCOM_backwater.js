It’s a still pool created by a dam or a curve in the river. If a small town is described as <i>backwater</i>, then not much happens or changes there.</p><p class="long">The word <i>backwater</i> has been around since the 14th Century meaning “water behind a dam.” Now it refers to any flat water, not just the water behind a dam. <i>Backwater</i> can also describe a place or situation that seems stuck in a rut, unmoved by current events. Literally, backwater is water that’s away from the current; figuratively, backwater is a place that’s away from current events.</p></div>`;
