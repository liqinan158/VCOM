Your eyes might be too <i>bleary</i> first thing in the morning to focus on the newspaper â€” at least before you've had a cup of coffee.</p><p class="long"><i>Bleary</i> almost always describes a person's eyes, although you can also use it simply to mean blurred or exhausted. A day spent traveling from Asia to North America can leave you with bleary eyes, and so can a night of crying after the death of your beloved dog. The word <i>bleary</i> comes from a now-obsolete adjective, <i>blear</i>, "watery or rheumy," which may share a root with the German <i>blerre</i>, "having blurred vision."</p></div>`;
