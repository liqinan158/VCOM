You might love the movie "West Side Story," except for the <i>longueur</i> of the dream sequence that features a ballet dance.</p><p class="long">You'll often come across this word in its plural form, <i>longueurs</i>, as when a book reviewer notes the longueurs of a writer's descriptions of the English countryside, or your aunt starts to snore during the longueurs of a play's third act. You can use this noun for any dull spell, but it's mostly a literary or performing arts term, from the French <i>longueur</i>, "length," and the Latin root <i>longus</i>, "long."</p></div>`;
