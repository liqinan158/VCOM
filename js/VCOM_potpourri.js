You may own a <i>potpourri</i> of books â€” from classic literature to trashy novels and from Shakespeare's plays to comic books.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>potpourri</i> often refers to a scented mixture of spices and dried flowers that is usually kept in a decorative bowl or jar and used to perfume a room. What's interesting is that the name for this attractively fragrant mixture comes from the French phrase <i>pot pourri</i>, which literally means "rotten pot." The phrase was used to describe a stew.
