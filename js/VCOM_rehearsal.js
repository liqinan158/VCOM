You're likely to be nervous about your magic show if the <i>rehearsal</i> goes badly.</p><p class="long">When you practice for a play, read your speech in front of a mirror, or go through a dance performance before the big show, you're taking part in a rehearsal. Any kind of practice session can be called a <i>rehearsal</i>, like a wedding rehearsal or a musician's rehearsal. The Old French root of <i>rehearsal</i> is <i>rehercier</i>, "go over again." Originally, <i>rehearsal</i> just meant "to say something over again;" in the mid-1500s it began to also mean "practice a play."</p></div>`;
