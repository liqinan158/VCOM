If you were a Roman emperor, you might've watched a chariot race at a <i>stadium</i>, but these days you're more likely to go to a <i>stadium</i> see a football game or your favorite band.</p><p class="long">The word <i>stadium</i> is the Latin form of the Greek <i>stadion</i>, which was a length of about 600 human feet. Running tracks at the earliest Greek Olympics were approximately one <i>stadion</i> in length, and Roman tracks of a similar size were surrounded by tiered seating â€” which led to the English meaning of stadium, a track or field in the middle of tiered seats.</p></div>`;
