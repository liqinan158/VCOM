You have to pull or drag or tug things when you schlep them. You can also describe an awkward, long, or rough trip as a <i>schlep</i>: "It's such a <i>schlep</i> to get down Grandma's road during mud season." The word has a Yiddish root, <i>shlepen</i>, "to drag," from the Germanic <i>sleifen</i>, also "to drag."</p></div></div>`;
