The giant slabs of Stonehenge, remain a <i>mystery</i> to this day.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>mystery</i> comes from the Greek <i>mysterion,</i> meaning "secret rite or doctrine." A great synonym for <i>secret</i> is <i>enigma</i>. We use this word all the time to describe stuff we don't understand, from crop circles and UFOs to the origins of the universe and the workings of the human brain. In literature, drama, and film, a mystery is a story that centers around a crime, usually murder, which finally gets solved at the very end.</p></div></div>`;
