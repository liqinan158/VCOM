A ripe <i>raw</i> tomato tastes very different from one that's slowly roasted with olive oil.</p><p class="long">Raw food isn't heated, and while raw fruits and vegetables are usually delicious, raw eggs and meat can be dangerous. When you use the word <i>raw</i> to describe things that aren't edible, it generally means "in a natural, untreated state," like raw silk or raw wood. You might also have raw feelings or raw emotions â€” these are basic and out in the open. The Old English root is <i>hreaw</i>, "uncooked," from a Germanic source.</p></div>`;
