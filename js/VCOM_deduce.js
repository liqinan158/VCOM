When you see a person crying, it's easy to <i>deduce</i> that the person is sad. Unless they're happy, of course. Sometimes happy people cry.</p><p class="long">Derived from the Latin <i>ducere</i>, meaning "to lead," a person who <i>deduces</i> something is "leading" their mind from one idea to the next. <i>Deduction</i> is a noun from the verb <i>deduce</i>: it's what we call something that we learn when we deduce. Sherlock Holmes, the famous investigator created by Arthur Conan Doyle, was a master of deduction. He could deduce from a few small clues all of the facts of a murder case.</p></div>`;
