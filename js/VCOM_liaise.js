Two rival soccer teams might <i>liaise</i> to discuss the muddy conditions of the town's soccer fields.</p><p class="long"><i>Liaise</i> came from the word <i>liaison</i> during World War I, when it was used mostly to mean "form a military cooperation or alliance." The Latin root is <i>ligatio</i>, or "a binding"; when two groups liaise, they bind together or connect in order to gain a result that they both want. The very trickiest thing about the word <i>liaise</i> is remembering that it's spelled not with one "i" but with two.</p></div></div>`;
