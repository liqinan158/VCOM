If you catch a firefly and keep it in a jar, its life will be one of captivity until you let it go. When you're imprisoned or enslaved, you're <i>captive</i>. Both words come from a Latin source, <i>captivus</i>, "caught" or "taken prisoner," from the root <i>capere</i>, "to take, hold, or seize."</p></div></div>`;
