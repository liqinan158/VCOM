It means believing that the way you're used to doing things is the only right way to do them, and that people or cultures that do things differently are wrong. <i>Ethnocentrism</i> comes from the Greek <i>ethno</i>, or "people" and <i>centric</i>, "center;" so when you put your own people, or culture, at the center of the world, you're letting your ethnocentrism show.</p></div></div>`;
