No matter how you spin the rings, the disc stays flat.  In the 1850s, a French physicist used a gyroscope to explain how the Earth rotates on its axis.  For his clever experiment, he got to name the gyroscope, choosing a combination of Greek words that literally translates to “circle watcher.”</p></div>`;
