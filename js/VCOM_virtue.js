If you're writing a screenplay and you want it to be a real tearjerker, make sure your hero is full of <i>virtue</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>virtue</i> comes from the Latin root <i>vir</i>, for man. At first <i>virtue</i> meant manliness or valor, but over time it settled into the sense of moral excellence. <i>Virtue</i> can also mean excellence in general. One of your virtues might be your generous willingness to help out your friends. The phrase <i>by virtue of</i> means "as a result of" or "by authority of." You will achieve success by virtue of hard work (or by virtue of inside connections).</p></div></div>`;
