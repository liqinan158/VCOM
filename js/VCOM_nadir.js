This means “lowest point.”</p><p class="long">This was originally strictly an astronomical term and is the opposite of the word <i>zenith,</i> which is the part of the sky located directly above a person’s head or, “high point.”  In fact, <i>nadir</i> is derived from the Arabic <i>nazir,</i> which means “opposite to.” It is still used in astronomy to indicate the part of the celestial sphere located directly below an observer, but also more generally to describe the worst point of someone’s life or career.</p></div></div>`;
