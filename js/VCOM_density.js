For example, suppose you have two boxes, one large and one small. However, they both weigh the same. That means the small box has a higher <i>density</i> than the large box.</p><p class="long"><i>Density</i> also tells how concentrated or crowded something is. You may have heard of population density. In a city, there are many people packed into a small area, giving it a high population density. In a rural area, there are more fields or wooded areas between houses. That means there are fewer people living in a larger area, which is why it has a low population density.</p></div>`;
