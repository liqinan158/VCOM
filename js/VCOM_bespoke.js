It's an adjective that is more common in Britain than in the United States. <i>Bespoke</i> can also describe non-clothing items that are made-to-order, as well as the person who makes such things: a bespoke jeweler. The term was originally <i>bespoken</i>, meaning "spoken of or arranged beforehand." Obviously, if you wanted a custom-made suit, you had to make arrangements before buying it.</p></div>`;
