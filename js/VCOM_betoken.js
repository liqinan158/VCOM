In other words, the clouds indicate or point to the fact that a thunderstorm is on its way.</p><p class="long">You're most likely to come across the word <i>betoken</i> in an English class or a book, since it's primarily a literary word used to express the idea of signifying or symbolizing something. There's often a sense of mystery around the word; for example, a black cat might betoken bad luck, or be an omen of something slightly scary. However, there are plenty of cheerful examples, like when a ring betokens love.</p></div></div>`;
