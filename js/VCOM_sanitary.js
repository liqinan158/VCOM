It's important for hospitals to be <i>sanitary</i>.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>sanitary</i> is useful when you need something stronger than just "clean." <i>Sanitary</i> implies the absence of germs as well as a clean appearance â€” you probably hope that your favorite restaurant's kitchen is sanitary, and your visiting friends will appreciate your bathroom being sanitary as well. The origin of <i>sanitary</i> is the Latin word <i>sanitas</i>, or "health," from the root <i>sanus</i>, which means both "healthy" and "sane."</p></div>`;
