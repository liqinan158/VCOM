When a bully pressures classmates to hand over their lunch money, the bully might go home that day with a pocket full of <i>ill-gotten</i> quarters.</p><p class="long">You'll often find this adjective in the phrase "<i>ill-gotten</i> gains," a general description of anything that's obtained unethically. The CEO of a company who embezzles money from it might be caught with a bank account full of ill-gotten gains, and pawn shops are places where criminals sometimes sell the ill-gotten gains they've stolen. If your dog steals your dinner off the kitchen table, you can describe it as his ill-gotten steak.</p></div>`;
