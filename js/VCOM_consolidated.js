You might melt two metals together, and when they cool, you'll have a <i>consolidated</i> compound that's stronger than either metal alone.</p><p class="long">When you get married, if you and your spouse put all your belongings together, you might end up with two garlic presses and two electric drills, but you'll have a <i>consolidated</i> household. When you see "Consolidated" in the name of a company, you can expect that the company is made up of several companies that merged. The adjective <i>consolidated</i> comes from the Latin roots <i>con-</i> "together," and <i>solidatus,</i> "make solid."</p></div></div>`;
