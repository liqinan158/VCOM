There are many <i>nightclubs</i> in New York City, but there are no <i>nightclubs</i> at all in most tiny Vermont villages.</p><p class="long">Visitors to a nightclub can eat and drink; watch singers, dancers, or comedians perform; and usually also dance to live music or songs played by a DJ. You can also call a nightclub a "club" for short â€” the dance floor is what distinguishes it from a bar or a pub. The word <i>nightclub</i> sounds modern, but it dates from the late nineteenth century.</p></div></div>`;
