Only obsessive cleaners can keep <i>immaculate</i> homes, but it’s a goal we can strive for, like that far-off mountain.</p><p class="long"><i>Immaculate</i> literally means without a spot or a stain. We can use <i>immaculate</i> to describe physical things, like bathrooms or kitchens. But we also use the word metaphorically to describe honor or purity — in the Catholic church, being immaculate means being "free from sin," like the Virgin Mary. Or someone with a pure, exact singing voice could be described as having immaculate pitch. If your home team plays a perfect game, you could say their performance was immaculate.</p></div>`;
