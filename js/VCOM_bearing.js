Bearing, for example, is the name given to a mechanical part that supports a moving joint â€” like a ball bearing. In buildings, bearings are walls or beams that support the building. In the same way, when you carry your body, you are bearing yourself up. Bearing also is used to talk about direction and travel: you could step off the sidewalk and nearly be run over by a car bearing north.</p></div>`;
