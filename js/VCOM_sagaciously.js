She <i>sagaciously</i> saved her allowance until she had enough to buy a new bike â€” I unwisely spent mine on candy, so I'll have to walk.</p><p class="long">The adverb <i>sagaciously</i> is a smart way to describe actions that arise from keen logic and deep intelligence. You can also use it for something that only appears to be done this way: "I had no idea what he was talking about, but I nodded sagaciously and changed the subject." It comes from the Latin <i>sagacitatem</i>, "keenness of perception," and a root meaning "to seek."</p></div>`;
