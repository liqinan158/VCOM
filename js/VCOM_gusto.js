Some people live their whole lives with <i>gusto</i>.</p><p class="long">Since the 17th century, <i>gusto</i> has been helping English speakers describe things that are done with vigor and enthusiasm. <i>Gusto</i> is Italian for “taste,” and its Italian origins are evident both in its spelling, with its “o” ending, and its sense of “a taste for life." Use this word to describe vigorous activities — you probably wouldn’t "take a nap with gusto," even if you really enjoy napping. You're more likely to cheer on your favorite team or dance the tango with gusto.</p></div></div>`;
