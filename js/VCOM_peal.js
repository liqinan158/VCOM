So, you may hear a <i>peal</i> of laughter or a peal of <i>thunder</i>, but you wouldn't refer to a solitary scream as a <i>peal</i>.</p><p class="long">You'll often notice the regular, repeated peal of church bells — in fact, they sometimes peal on the hour. In the fourteenth century, a <i>peal</i> referred specifically to church bells, in fact. The word is a shortened version of <i>appeal</i>, from the idea that the bells "summon" or "call " worshippers to the church. In contemporary times, <i>peal</i> is more often used to describe more commonly repeated sounds — like barking, laughter or thunder.</p></div></div>`;
