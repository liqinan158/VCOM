var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">cushion</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Fabric filled with foam, feathers, or other padding material makes a <i>cushion</i>, which can be used to make something like a chair or sofa more comfortable.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>cushion</i> can also refer to anything that is used to soften an impact or absorb shocks. In modern cars, for example, sometimes in a crash or accident, air bags will deploy and act as cushions for the passengers to prevent them from injuring themselves on hard surfaces like the dashboard or steering wheel. A cushion isn't necessarily a physical one, however, as you may want to keep an emergency fund as a cushion in case of unexpected expenses. As a verb, cushion means to protect from the impact of negative information so if you have bad news, you'll want to cushion the blow as much as possible.</p></div></div>`;
