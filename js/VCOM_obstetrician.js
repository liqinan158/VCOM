But even though an obstetrician is a medical doctor and can be  male or female, the name goes back to the Latin word for midwife, <i>obstetrix</i>, the woman who "stands in front [of the woman having the baby]." Obstetricians are often called “O.B.,” for short, and an O.B. who also treats diseases of the female reproductive system is called an “O.B.-G.Y.N.,” “<i>obstetrician</i>-gynecologist.”</p></div></div>`;
