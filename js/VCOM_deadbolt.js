It's very common to have a <i>deadbolt</i> on an apartment door or the front door of a house.</p><p class="long">When you turn a key in the lock of a deadbolt, the bolt slides in or out of an opening in the door jamb. Deadbolts are considered to be secure locks that are difficult to open without a key, especially when compared to a spring-loaded lock, the kind you see in the center of a doorknob. While spring latches can be pushed back manually, deadbolts can't â€” which is why they're called <i>deadbolts</i>. They're <i>dead</i>, or unmovable.</p></div></div>`;
