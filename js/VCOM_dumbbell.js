You typically lift a <i>dumbbell</i> with one hand â€” unless it's too heavy and you accidentally drop it on your foot. Ouch!</p><p class="long">The short, handheld exercise weights are known as dumbbells, while the larger weights that require two hands for lifting are <i>barbells</i>. If you're new to weightlifting, you might want to start doing bicep curls with light dumbbells. The name comes from the bar once used to ring a church bell: dumbbells resemble these ringers, although they're <i>dumb</i>, or "silent." <i>Dumbbell </i> is also used in a derogatory way to mean "stupid person."</p></div></div>`;
