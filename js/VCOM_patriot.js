var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">patriot</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>patriot</i> is someone who loves and who has sometimes fought for his or her country. “Nathan Hale was a true <i>patriot</i>; his only regret was that he had but one life to give for his country.”</p><p class="long">The word <i>patriot</i> comes from <i>patrios</i> (Greek, not Latin for once), which means "of one’s father." So, despite various references to the motherland, the word <i>patriot</i> more or less lands us square in the fatherland arena. And if you’re a football fan, the New England <i>Patriots</i> is a near-Boston-based team (Boston being a major source of American <i>patriots</i> in the Revolutionary War). And, if you want to get yourself in trouble, you can wander Boston with a megaphone chanting, “The <i>Patriots</i> stink.”</p></div></div>`;
