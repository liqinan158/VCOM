var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">delighted</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">You can use the adjective <i>delighted</i> to describe being really pleased or happy with something. Maybe you would be "stoked" about getting backstage passes to a concert, while someone getting backstage passes to the symphony would be <i>delighted</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Delighted</i> might be a slightly old-fashioned way to show excitement or enthusiasm, or maybe it's a more refined way to express how you feel. Saying, "Oh, I'm so <i>delighted</i> you decided to come!" was once a common way to show how happy you were to see a friend. More contemporary uses might be sarcastic, like when you hand your mom an armload of stinky gym clothes without a "Please" and she says "I'll be <i>delighted</i> to wash these for you!"</p></div>`;
