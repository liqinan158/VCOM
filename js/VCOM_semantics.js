It can be applied to entire texts or to single words. For example, "destination" and "last stop" technically mean the same thing, but students of <i>semantics</i> analyze their subtle shades of meaning.</p><p class="long">To correctly pronounce <i>semantics</i> — which is a singular noun even though it ends in <i>s</i> — accent the second syllable: "suh-MAN-ticks." In the late 1800s, Michel Bréal coined the term <i>sémantique</i> to describe the psychology of language. That French word has its origins in Greek: <i>semantikos</i> means "significant," and comes from <i>semainein</i> "to show, signify, indicate by a sign." Semantics investigates the meaning of language.</p></div></div>`;
