But a monarch can. <i>Monarch</i> comes from the Greek <i>mono</i>, "one," and <i>archon</i>, "ruler." Many modern monarchies actually have parliaments and constitutions, leaving the monarch more symbolic than powerful. A monarch is also a particularly royal looking butterfly with orange wings and black and white spots.</p></div>`;
