It's <i>gustation</i> that allows you to experience sweetness and saltiness when you bite into a barbecue potato chip.</p><p class="long"><i>Gustation</i>, from the Latin <i>gustare</i>, "to taste, partake of, or enjoy," shares a Proto-Indo-European root with <i>gusto</i>. This is especially apt when you think about enthusiastically eating a meal that's complex and delicious. The process of gustation involves tastes like salty, sour, sweet, and bitter. Gustation begins when you take a bite of food and special cells on your tongue's taste buds begin to react chemically with it.</p></div>`;
