Instead, you should think about it first and then decide what you want to do. In science, the word <i>react</i> is used to describe what happens when two substances combine and cause a chemical change in each other. When you add baking soda to vinegar, the chemicals in each react and create a foamy lava like substance.</p></div></div>`;
