The raised front of the saddle itself can also be called a <i>pommel</i>.</p><p class="long">Some saddles, particularly the modern western type, have a metal grip at the front, known either as a horn or a <i>pommel</i>. Other saddles don't have this knob, but instead have a raised front edge that's also called the <i>pommel</i>. When <i>pommel</i> is used as a verb, it means "beat or strike repeatedly," a variation on the word <i>pummel</i>. The Old French root is <i>pomel</i>, "rounded knob," from the Latin word <i>pomum</i>, or "apple."</p></div>`;
