Curdled sour milk is pretty <i>unsavory</i>, as are the dirty details of the latest political scandal.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>unsavory</i> was formed by merging <i>un</i>, meaning “not,” with <i>savory</i>, meaning “pleasant, agreeable.” So if it's unsavory, it's unpleasant. First used to describe revolting tastes, <i>unsavory</i> now also applies to just about anything that figuratively leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Mobsters do all kinds of unsavory things to the people that cross them. So you probably shouldn't hang out with such unsavory characters.</p></div>`;
