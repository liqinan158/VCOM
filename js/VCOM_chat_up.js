var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">chat up</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>chat up</i> is to talk playfully or casually with someone, especially with the goal of convincing them to do something. Your brother might <i>chat up</i> a movie theater worker in the hopes of getting a free ticket.</p><p class="long">When you chat someone up, your light banter is persuasive â€” although in many cases, your goal is simply to flirt, or simply to start a conversation. You could chat up your new classmate, or chat up your seatmate on a long airplane flight. Another way to use this phrase is <i>chat someone up</i>, as in, "I'm going to <i>chat</i> George <i>up</i> and see if he'll give me some of his pizza."</p></div>`;
