Several industries created <i>blacklists</i> during the US anti-communist period of the 1940s and 50s.</p><p class="long">One of the most famous blacklists was the one established in Hollywood in 1947, with the intention of keeping Communists and their "sympathizers" from working in the film industry. You can use the word as a verb too, meaning to put someone's name on such a list, or to exclude them from employment or inclusion. The term itself dates all the way back to the 17th century, when it was defined as "list of persons who have incurred suspicion."</p></div></div>`;
