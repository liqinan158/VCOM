Try to avoid talking <i>flippantly</i> about ghosts and monsters around your young cousin, who is terrified of spooky creatures.</p><p class="long">It's usually fine to be casual, but when you talk or act flippantly, you're likely to offend someone. The word implies a lack of seriousness or respect, so if you speak flippantly to your teacher — answering a question with a snarky "Whatever!" for example — you might just get yourself in trouble. <i>Flippantly</i> comes from the adjective <i>flippant</i>, originally a positive attribute; in the 16th century it meant "limber or nimble."</p></div>`;
