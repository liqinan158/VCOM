If your mother shows up at your door <i>unscheduled</i>, hope that you've been keeping the place nice and clean since you won't have time to tidy up before her arrival.</p><p class="long">The word <i>unscheduled</i> describes something that is not planned or scheduled in advance, as seen by the prefix <i>un-</i> meaning "not." An unscheduled interruption of a television program might mean there's breaking news that you need to hear. An unscheduled delay of a flight might mean you're stuck in the airport for hours. Whatever it may be, something that's unscheduled happens without your expecting it, which means it might very well throw you off your regular routine or schedule.</p></div></div>`;
