All the takeout containers in your trash can may remind you that you haven't eaten homemade food in a while, but if there's an amazing Chinese restaurant in your neighborhood, it's hard to resist picking up nightly takeout. You can also use the terms <i>carryout</i> and <i>takeaway</i>, but <i>takeout</i> is the oldest of these, dating from around 1940.</p></div></div>`;
