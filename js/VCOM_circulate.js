A ceiling fan <i>circulates</i> cool air around the room on a warm day.</p><p class="long">Blood circulates through your body, pumped from your heart through veins and arteries — your <i>circulatory</i> system — and delivering oxygen to your tissues. This system is closed, meaning the blood stays in your body, bringing oxygenated blood back to your heart. People circulate when they move around a room at a party, chatting with different people, and rumors circulate when they're passed in a circle, from person to person. <i>Circulate</i> comes from the Latin <i>circulare</i>, "to form a circle."</p></div></div>`;
