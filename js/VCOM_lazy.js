You were offended at being called lazy, but you just didn't have the energy to defend yourself.  After all, who doesn't enjoy a lazy Sunday afternoon?  Former President of Poland Lech Walesa once considered the benefits of being lazy when he said, â€œIt's the lazy people who invented the wheel and the bicycle because they didn't like walking or carrying things."</p></div></div>`;
