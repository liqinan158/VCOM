You may <i>marvel</i> at the depth of the Grand Canyon or at the size of a pimple.</p><p class="long">When it entered the English language in 1300, <i>marvel</i> meant "miracle" –- that is, a supernatural act of divine agency (<i>miracle</i> actually comes from the same Latin word as <i>marvel</i>). By 1386, Geoffrey Chaucer was able to use the Middle English <i>meruailles</i> to describe more mundane astonishment. Chaucer also used <i>marvel</i> –- <i>maruaylen</i>, actually –- as a verb. In contemporary usage, the close synonym <i>wonder</i> is used much more often –- unless you happen to be a fan of the comic book universe created by Stan Lee. As a noun, anything that provokes wonder is a marvel.</p></div></div>`;
