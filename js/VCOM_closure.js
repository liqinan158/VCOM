It can be physical — like the <i>closure</i> of your local library — or emotional, like the <i>closure</i> you experience when you finally come to terms with the end of a romance.</p><p class="long"><i>Closure</i> comes from the Latin <i>claus</i> ("shut"), and it has many different shades of meaning. A road closure blocks that road from traffic. If you find closure after an emotional hardship, you're ready to move on. An obstruction in a small passage, like a pipe, is also a closure, as is the button on your sweater. In debate, closure (usually <i>cloture</i>), stops debate and starts the vote.</p></div></div>`;
