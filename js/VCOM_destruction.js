Tornadoes often leave a trail of <i>destruction</i>, damaging neighborhoods and knocking down houses.</p><p class="long">The Latin word <i>destructionem</i>, "a pulling down," is the root of <i>destruction</i>. When destruction strikes, things do get pulled down â€” from houses in the case of natural disasters or a big display of canned soups in the case of a careless shopper. Sometimes, <i>destruction</i> refers to death, as when critics of war talk about the resulting destruction of human life.</p></div>`;
