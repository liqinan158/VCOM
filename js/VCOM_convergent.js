Two trains, for example, arriving at the same station from different directions are said to be convergent; or two species of animals inhabiting the same environment that grow more and more alike in habit are also said to be convergent. The opposite of <i>convergent</i> is <i>divergent</i> — as in a Red Sox fan and a Yankees fan arguing about which is the better team.</p></div>`;
