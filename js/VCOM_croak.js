Crows and people with sore throats can <i>croak</i>, too. It’s also a slang word for “die.” When people <i>croak</i>, they need either a glass of water or an undertaker.</p><p class="long"><i>Croak</i> is a noun or a verb. A bullfrog’s croak can be very loud. A parched cowboy might croak, “howdy.” Another meaning of the word is "die," as in, "I'm sorry your hamster's dead, but you knew he was going to <i>croak</i> soon.” This kind of <i>croak</i> came from the popular idea that people make a distinctive sound just before they die, a "death rattle." Now there’s something to look forward to!</p></div>`;
