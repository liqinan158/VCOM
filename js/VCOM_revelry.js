If you enjoy the <i>revelry</i> of a New Year's Eve party, you might pay for partying hard the next day.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>revelry</i> means merrymaking, but because it comes from the French word <i>reveler</i> meaning to rebel, its tone indicates carousing or noisy partying. It's not your grandparents' tame, sedate cocktail party: revelry is a full-throttle festive gathering, where people outwardly enjoy themselves. In fact, a wild party was once called a "revel," though you don't hear that term used much today.</p></div></div>`;
