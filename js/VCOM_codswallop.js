If you're hoping for an <i>A</i> on your paper, it's disappointing to get a <i>D</i> and a note from your teacher saying, "This is a bunch of <i>codswallop</i>!"</p><p class="long"><i>Codswallop</i> is a colorful, informal way to describe something that's utterly ridiculous, especially a written or spoken statement you find absurd. A movie critic might describe a big-budget monstrosity as codswallop, and a haughty older brother might dismiss everything his younger sister says as "Nothing but <i>codswallop</i>." The word is primarily British, and it's been around since about 1960. Its origin isn't certain, but it may come from <i>wallop</i>, slang for "beer."</p></div>`;
