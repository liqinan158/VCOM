Although it's not related to nerve cells, a harmless but visible lump on the skin is known as a <i>ganglion</i> cyst.</p><p class="long">It's not uncommon for people to get benign but annoying ganglion cysts on their hands as they age. This use of <i>ganglion</i> goes back to the Greek root meaning "knot, swelling under the skin, or tumor." <i>Ganglion</i> came to mean "nerve cells" in medical terminology by the 17th century (although the cyst meaning also stuck around). Humans have many ganglia in their bodies, including the clusters around our spinal nerves and the basal ganglia in our brains.</p></div></div>`;
