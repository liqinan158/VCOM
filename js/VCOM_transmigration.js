If you believe your cat is your reincarnated grandmother, then you believe in <i>transmigration</i>.</p><p class="long">The pieces of this word might look familiar — <i>trans</i> means “across,” as in <i>transport</i> or <i>transcontinental</i>, and <i>migration</i> is the act of moving, like birds flying south. <i>Transmigration</i> used to just mean what it sounds like, as in “move from one place to another,” but later it took on the deeper meaning of a soul moving into another body after death. Various religions are associated with different types of transmigration.</p></div>`;
