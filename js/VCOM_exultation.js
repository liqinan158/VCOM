That's an expression you might shout in <i>exultation</i> or extreme happiness. On New Year's Eve, Times Square is bursting with <i>exultation</i> as people shout and sing joyfully to ring in the new year.</p><p class="long"><i>Exultation</i> comes from the Latin <i>exsilire</i>, which means "leap out or up." Think of leaping for joy and you've pretty much captured the sentiment of exultation. This word is used to describe a kind of triumphant joy, the kind you might see at the end of a football game when the winning team is pumping their fists, cheering and dumping Gatorade all over their coach.</p></div>`;
