Unlike a shotgun or a rifle, you can hold and fire a <i>pistol</i> with one hand.</p><p class="long">Sometimes the word <i>pistol</i> is used for any handgun, but many people distinguish between the pistol, with its single chamber, and the revolver, which has a cylinder that rotates and holds many bullets. The earliest pistols were used in sixteenth century Europe, and the English word comes from the Middle French <i>pistolet</i>, meaning both "small firearm" and "small dagger." You can also call someone who's full of energy a <i>pistol</i>.</p></div>`;
