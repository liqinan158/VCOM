He is <i>pensive</i>, the opposite of cheery and carefree.</p><p class="long">If you've studied Spanish, you know that the verb <i>pensar</i> means "to think." If you're pensive, you might simply be thinking hard about something. Having no expression or maybe even frowning can be a result of being so engrossed in your thoughts â€” it might not reflect a melancholy attitude. Remember this the next time you're about to ask a pensive person, "What's wrong?" It could very well be nothing.</p></div>`;
