Poker players <i>bet</i> on each hand, hoping the cards they hold will beat those of the other players.</p><p class="long">Sometimes you bet money on a sporting event, wagering on the team you think will win and collecting even more money if it does. It's even more common to bet in a figurative way, saying something like, "I'd be willing to <i>bet</i> that the bus will be late again." The money you risk when you bet is also called a <i>bet</i>. The word probably comes from the now-obsolete noun <i>abet</i>, or "abetment."</p></div></div>`;
