All vertebrates — animals with spines — have <i>kidneys</i>.</p><p class="long">Human kidneys are shaped like large beans, and this is where the "<i>kidney</i> bean," a common red-colored bean, gets its name. The organs called kidneys are vital to life, as they filter bad stuff from your blood, help your body get rid of waste, regulate your blood pressure, and even produce hormones. The word <i>kidney</i> is probably a compound of the Old English <i>cwið</i>, "womb," and <i>ey</i>, "egg," describing the organ's shape.</p></div>`;
