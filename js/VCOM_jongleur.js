If you were a noble in medieval France, your household might have been entertained occasionally by singing, juggling <i>jongleurs</i> .</p><p class="long">A jongleur was very similar to a medieval minstrel or troubadour. While minstrels were commonly employed as household servants by wealthy families, jongleurs were itinerant entertainers who could be hired to sing, recite verses, do magic tricks, or juggle for an evening's entertainment. In fact, the word <i>jongleur</i> also means "juggler," from the Latin <i>ioculator</i>, "jester, joker, or juggler."</p></div></div>`;
