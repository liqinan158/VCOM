Or <i>bellicose</i> ones. <i>Bellicose</i> means eager for war.</p><p class="long"><i>Bellicose</i> is from Latin <i>bellum</i> "war." A near synonym is <i>belligerent</i>, from the same Latin noun. You may wonder if they're connected to the Latin <i>bellus</i> "pretty, handsome," which gives us the names Bella or Isabella, as well as <i>belle</i> "a beautiful woman." They're not. War and beauty are not related, except in the case of Helen of Troy.</p></div></div>`;
