You can say your favorite baseball team <i>clobbers</i> the competition if they win with a score of 10 to 0.</p><p class="long">When a boxer knocks out his adversary he clobbers him, and a bully clobbers his victim by punching him repeatedly. You can also clobber someone without shedding blood, as when you beat your dad in chess. The word <i>clobber</i> was originally World War II British air force slang, in the 1940s, and usually referred to aerial bombing.</p></div>`;
