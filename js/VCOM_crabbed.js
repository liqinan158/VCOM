You can think of <i>crabbed</i> as describing what someone would be like if they were made into a crab. The word is used less often than its synonym <i>crabby</i>, but the meaning of <i>crabbed</i> is just as easy to understand: if you were covered in sand all day, you’d probably feel crabbed too!</p></div></div>`;
