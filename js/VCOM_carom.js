You might enjoy watching the bumps and <i>caroms</i> of the bumper cars at the fair more than actually driving one.</p><p class="long"><i>Carom</i> is a verb, too, so you might describe a pinball machine this way: "When you push the buttons, flippers hit the little silver ball, which <i>caroms</i> around the machine, bouncing off the bumpers and kickers." The original meaning of this word is also one that's still in use â€” it's a game similar to pool or billiards, played on a table with no pockets. It comes from the Spanish word <i>carombola</i>, "the red ball in billiards."</p></div>`;
