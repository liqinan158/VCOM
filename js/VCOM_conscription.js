During the Vietnam War, many U.S. citizens protested conscription by burning their draft documents or fleeing to Canada, and some faced prison time because of these actions.  The Latin roots of <i>conscription</i> translate to “write down together,” which is a much nicer way of saying “Go to war or go to jail.”</p></div></div>`;
