You might be <i>nettled</i> by the terrible traffic on the way to work every morning.</p><p class="long">Your favorite teacher might be nettled when very few students hand in their homework, and your mom might tend to get nettled when she's at a very loud restaurant and can't hear what anyone is saying. To be nettled is to be exasperated or peeved, and the word developed in the 1400s as a figurative version of the verb to <i>nettle</i>, "to beat with nettles." <i>Nettles</i>, of course, are a prickly, stinging plant.</p></div>`;
