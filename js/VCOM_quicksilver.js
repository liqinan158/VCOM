If you look closely at an old-fashioned thermometer, you can see the <i>quicksilver</i> inside it.</p><p class="long">It's more common to refer to this metal — the only one that is liquid at room temperature — as <i>mercury</i>, but it's also correct to call it <i>quicksilver</i>, which describes the properties of the element very well. Quicksilver is liquid, silver colored, and is fascinating to look at. The word comes from the sense of <i>quick</i> that means "alive;" the Latin root is <i>argentum vivum</i>, which is literally "living silver."</p></div>`;
