If you're in the Caribbean on vacation, you could spend some time looking for buried pirate <i>booty</i>.</p><p class="long">Although <i>booty</i> originally meant stolen goods from war or pirating activities, the term is now sometimes used more generically to mean any riches or treasure. Although you may feel as though you plundered your own bank account to buy new clothes for yourself, all the booty you brought home from the mall might make you decide that it was worth it.</p></div>`;
