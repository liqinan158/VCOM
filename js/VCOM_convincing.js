Describe an argument as <i>convincing</i> if it wins you over and makes you believe in its rightness.</p><p class="long">To figure out what <i>convincing</i> means, remember that <i>vincere </i> is the Latin word for "to conquer." Add on the prefix <i>con-</i>, meaning "with," and you get something that has the ability to conquer â€” whether it's doubts, disbelief, or hostility. The suffix <i>-ing</i> tells you that the word describes the action or result of something. The result of a convincing argument is more people who have joined your side or cause.</p></div></div>`;
