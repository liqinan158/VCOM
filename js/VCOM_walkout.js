Sometimes students stage <i>walkouts</i>, refusing to attend classes, to demonstrate their disapproval with school policies.</p><p class="long">If your friends at school object strongly to the dress code, they might plan a walkout, abandoning English class and gathering outside to chant protest slogans. You can think of a walkout as a kind of strike, a mass demonstration that conveys a message to company owners or others in charge. By refusing to work, even briefly, workers are able to really get their employers' attention â€” this makes walkouts a powerful form of protest.</p></div>`;
