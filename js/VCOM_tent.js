When you go camping, you might sleep in a camper, a rustic cabin, or a <i>tent</i>.</p><p class="long">Tents can be lightweight enough to be carried by a hiker for miles, or much heavier and more cumbersome. As a verb, <i>tent</i> means either "stay in a tent" or "cover, as you do with a tent." So you might tent your head with a blanket to keep your crazy cat from attacking you, or tent a pie with aluminum foil to keep the crust from burning. <i>Tent</i> comes from a Latin root, <i>tentus</i>, meaning "stretched."</p></div></div>`;
