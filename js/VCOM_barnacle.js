You'll often find <i>barnacles</i> attached to the bottom of boats.</p><p class="long">Barnacles are crustaceans, which means they're related to crabs, lobsters, and shrimp, all of which have an external shell. In the case of barnacles, their shells attach to things like rocks, other shells, docks, and boats, and stay there permanently, filtering food from shallow ocean water through feathery appendages. The earliest use of the word referred to a European goose whose mythology described it hatching from the marine crustacean that eventually took its name.</p></div></div>`;
