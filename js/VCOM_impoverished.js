A person who lives on the street is <i>impoverished</i>, and a country may become <i>impoverished</i> after a devastating war.</p><p class="long"><i>Impoverished</i> comes from the Old French word <i>povre</i>, which means “poor,” and you can almost see the word <i>poverty</i> inside <i>impoverished</i>.  Living an impoverished life means that your finances and health are not in good shape, and in fact you could die because you can’t support yourself.  A corrupt and greedy government makes its citizens impoverished, and too much pollution will create impoverished soil that isn’t healthy enough to grow delicious vegetables.</p></div></div>`;
