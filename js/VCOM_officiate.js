At most weddings, a religious leader or judge <i>officiates</i>.</p><p class="long">A rabbi might officiate during your cousin's wedding, or the happy couple might ask a friend to officiate. When an official acts in some official way, they also officiate. A referee, for example, officiates at a hockey game, and a town's mayor might officiate at the grand opening of a new library. <i>Officiate</i>, as of the seventeenth century, mainly meant "perform the duty of a priest," from the Latin root <i>officium</i>, "kindness," or "official duty," and also "church service."</p></div>`;
