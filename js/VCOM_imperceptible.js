The world might be spinning, but it's <i>imperceptible</i> from your couch.</p><p class="long">Within the word <i>imperceptible</i> you see the word <i>percept</i>, which means "the object of your perception." Like <i>impossible</i>, the <i>im</i> in <i>imperceptible</i> means it cannot be perceived. <i>Imperceptible</i> is rarely used in the absolute sense of the word â€” it is usually paired with <i>almost</i>. Horton hears the Who but the tiny sounds of the Whos were almost imperceptible to everyone else.</p></div>`;
