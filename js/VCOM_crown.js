To <i>crown</i> someone is to declare them a monarch or a champion. A <i>crown</i> is also a boring old top of something, like a tooth.</p><p class="long">Historically, a crown represented the country ruled by the monarch who wore it. In some cases, the person wearing a crown wasn't the king, but the head of a church, as most modern-day Catholic popes have done during certain ceremonies. Other kinds of crowns are the top of a hat or the top part of your head, and also the visible part of a tooth â€” or the artificial replacement made by a dentist.</p></div>`;
