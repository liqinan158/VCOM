In algebra, it's especially common to use the quadratic equation, which has this form: <i>ax squared plus bx plus c equals 0</i>. The word <i>quadratic</i> comes up in calculus and statistics, too, and it can also be used to mean "square." In fact, the Latin root <i>quadratus</i> also means "square."</p></div></div>`;
