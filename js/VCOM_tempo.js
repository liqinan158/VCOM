It was originally used to describe the timing of music, or the speed at which a piece of music is played. For example, a soothing song would be described as a slow tempo song. <i>Tempo</i> is still used in this way to describe music, but you’ll also hear it used to refer to pace or speed in general, as in — "the increased <i>tempo</i> at the end of a close basketball game" or "the slow <i>tempo</i> of action in a novel."</p></div>`;
