If you understood everything you just read, you’re probably a <i>polyglot</i> — a person who understands multiple languages.</p><p class="long">There are thousands of languages spoken in the world, but you don’t need to know them all to be a polyglot. The –<i>glot</i> comes from the Greek word for “tongue,” and the prefix <i>poly</i>- means “more than one,” so if you speak two or more languages, you’re technically a polyglot. Well done! <i>Polyglot</i> can also be used as an adjective, like describing "a <i>polyglot</i> neighborhood" full of people from many different cultures or the "<i>polyglot</i> crowd at the Olympic games."</p></div>`;
