Writing all those college essays and filling out the applications is an <i>arduous</i> process!</p><p class="long"><i>Arduous</i> was first used in English to mean "steep" or "difficult to climb." If you're an outdoorsman, hiking up a mountain is a lot of fun, but if you're a couch potato, it's an arduous trek. Today, the word can be used figuratively for something that is difficult or takes a lot of work. If you spend an arduous week studying for your final exams, you'll do well because you've worked really hard!</p></div></div>`;
