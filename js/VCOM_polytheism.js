If you believe in <i>polytheism</i>, you have a bunch of gods to thank or blame.</p><p class="long">Though the most widely known religions today — Christianity, Judaism, and Islam — are all examples of monotheism, there have been plenty of religions that preach polytheism. Followers of those religions believe in a <i>pantheon</i> or group of gods, like the ancient Greeks who worshipped Zeus, Athena and the gang. Usually in polytheist religions certain gods are associated with specific things, like war or love.</p></div></div>`;
