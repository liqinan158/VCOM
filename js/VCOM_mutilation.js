You can also use the word for the result of this extreme kind of injury.</p><p class="long">When a person or an object has been altered or damaged in a permanent way, that's a mutilation. The mutilation of your favorite teddy bear by the family dog when you were little may have scarred you for life. Movie monsters sometimes exhibit mutilations (like missing eyes or limbs), and sometimes threaten mutilation to others (by wielding weapons or sharp teeth). The root word of this gory noun is the Latin <i>mutilare</i>, "to cut or lop off."</p></div>`;
