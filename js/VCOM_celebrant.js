The <i>celebrant</i>, sometimes with the help of friends or family, is the person who gets to blow out the candles on the birthday cake.</p><p class="long">You can use <i>celebrant</i> to mean the person being honored at a celebration, or everyone who's participating in it: "The New Year's Eve <i>celebrants</i> cheered as the clock struck midnight." The original meaning of this noun, and the one still most common outside of North America, is "someone who officiates," either at a wedding or a religious service. <i>Celebrant</i> comes from the Latin word <i>celebrare</i>, "assemble to honor."</p></div></div>`;
