To very young children, many adults seem <i>godlike</i> simply because they are large and powerful.</p><p class="long">A devout religious figure might seem godlike to many of his followers â€” in other words, he seems more like a god than a fallible, mortal human being. The qualities of such a person, or those of a magical or mystical character, are also godlike: "Her <i>godlike</i> ability to become invisible came in handy when she was fighting the bad guys." The word comes from the Old English <i>godlic</i>, or "divine."</p></div>`;
