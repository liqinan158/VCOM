This means you’ll have to stay in isolation and avoid contact with other people.</p><p class="long">Starting in the 16th century, a quarantine lasted specifically 40 days. The word is in fact derived from the Latin <i>quadraginta,</i> which means "forty." Originally, this referred to the amount of time a widow could remain in her deceased husband’s house, then referred to the period of time a ship had to wait off a country’s port if its passengers were disease-stricken. Now, it can mean a period of isolation of any length, and can be used as both a verb and a noun.</p></div>`;
