A <i>confusing</i>, hand-drawn map might lead you in circles as you try to find your destination.</p><p class="long">It can be confusing to walk out of a dark movie theater into the bright sunlight, or to get a phone call from someone whose voice you don't recognize. Situations like this disorient you a little bit. Things that are difficult and complicated, like a really hard math test, can also be confusing. The adjective comes from <i>confuse</i>, which has a Latin root, <i>confundere</i>, "mingle together."</p></div></div>`;
