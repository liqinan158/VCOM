var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">baroque</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Something <i>baroque</i> is overly ornate, like a paisley red velvet jacket with tassels, or music that has a lot going on and might include a harpsichord.</p><p class="long">Anything with a complicated design can be <i>baroque</i> but it also refers to a style of art, music, and architecture from 17th Century Italy (and is then sometimes capitalized). Although it has roots in the Portuguese word <i>barroco</i> meaning "imperfect pearl" not everything baroque is imperfect. Caravaggio and Rubens are considered baroque painters, and baroque composers include Vivaldi, Bach, and Handel. Although <i>rococo</i> and <i>baroque</i> both describe something over-the-top, sticklers will save <i>baroque</i> for something with heft and use <i>rococo</i> for lighter designs, like that velvet jacket. Historically, <i>Rococo</i> comes after the <i>Baroque</i> period.</p></div>`;
