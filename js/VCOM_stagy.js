When you talk to your friend in a loud, <i>stagy</i> voice, you behave as if you have an audience.</p><p class="long">Something that's artificial and a bit theatrical is stagy, like the stagy decor in your bedroom or the stagy dialogue in a writer's first novel. You could also call these things hammy or exaggeratedâ€”they're just a little bit over the top. The adjective <i>stagy</i> comes from <i>stage</i> and its meaning of "a raised platform for a performance," from the Latin <i>staticum</i>, "place for standing."</p></div></div>`;
