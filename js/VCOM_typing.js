If you're sick of writing out your English papers by hand, you might want to take a <i>typing</i> class.</p><p class="long">Back in the 1880s, <i>typing</i> meant writing with a typewriter. Today, <i>typing</i> is more likely to refer to entering text on a computer or smartphone. When you're typing, you can use the "hunt and peck" method, in which you push keys one at a time while looking at the keyboard. A typing teacher can help you master touch typing, in which you memorize where each key is, use every finger, and don't need to look at the keyboard.</p></div>`;
