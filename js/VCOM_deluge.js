You might be experiencing a <i>deluge</i> â€” like when you've been given a <i>deluge</i> of homework over vacation: a dozen term papers, two dozen books to read, and a mile-high stack of math problems.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>deluge</i> is an overwhelming amount of something in general, such as work, people, or questions. Because of its Latin roots, however, in particular it means an overwhelming amount of water. It comes from <i>diluvian</i>, which means flood. The verb <i>deluge</i> similarly means to overwhelm or inundate with something, particularly water. The hurricane <i>deluged</i> the island with rain. A deluge isn't always a bad thing, however. One thing most people would like to be <i>deluged</i> with? Money.</p></div></div>`;
