If you get caught speeding and reach into your wallet and hand the officer $20, that’s a <i>barefaced</i> attempt at a bribe.</p><p class="long"><i>Barefaced</i> — or as it's sometimes known, <i>bald-faced</i> — behavior is always bold and sometimes shameless. Nonchalantly telling a security guard at the jewelry store that you "plain forgot" you'd slipped the necklace into your pocket is a barefaced lie and shameless to boot. A reporter's barefaced questioning of a mayor found to be stealing from city treasury carries no shame, on the other hand  — at least not for the reporter.</p></div>`;
