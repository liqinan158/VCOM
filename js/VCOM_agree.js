This positive outcome is still part of the verb <i>agree</i>, because if people agree with you, your plan or idea is the one that will be used. In grammar, subjects and verbs agree when they are both singular or both plural. For example, "everyone is here" agrees but "everyone are here" does not.</p></div></div>`;
