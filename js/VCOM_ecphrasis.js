John Keats' famous "Ode on a Grecian Urn" is one well-known ecprhasis, a detailed reflection on a specific work of art. Ecphrasis can also be spoken or take other artistic forms â€” for example, your painting of a sculpture is also an ecphrasis, as is the song you wrote describing Vincent Van Gogh's <i>Starry Night</i>.</p></div>`;
