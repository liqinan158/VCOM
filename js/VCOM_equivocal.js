If you ask your teacher what's on an upcoming test and she gives you an <i>equivocal</i> answer, you won't be able to narrow down your studying.</p><p class="long"><i>Equivocal</i> is from the Latin <i>aequus</i>, "equal, the same," + <i>vocare</i>, "to call, to speak," and describes when something is too close to call. An editorial in your local newspaper might make a strong case for new taxes on soda, while another editorial is more equivocal. The fact that <i>equivocal</i> means "uncertain" and <i>unequivocal</i> means "certain" is tricky, and a lot of people get stumped.</p></div>`;
