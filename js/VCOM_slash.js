var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">slash</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To quickly and violently cut something is to <i>slash</i> it. Sword fighters in a play might just clank their swords together, though they seem to <i>slash</i> each other. After the play  is over, the snack stand might <i>slash</i> the price of popcorn.</p><p class="long">A vandal might slash the tires on people's cars, and a baker will sometimes slash the top of a loaf of bread. Both use a sharp knife, and make sweeping motions as they cut, but the similarities end there. Figuratively, <i>slash</i> can mean "reduce," so a sale at your grocery store might be announced with a sign reading "We <i>slash</i> prices!" This figurative meaning dates from the turn of the 20th century.</p></div>`;
