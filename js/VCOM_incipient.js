In its <i>incipient</i> form, basketball was played with a soccer ball and peach baskets for goals. Bouncy orange balls and nets came later.</p><p class="long"><i>Incipient</i> comes from the Latin <i>incipere</i> "to begin." The related, and more commonly used, word <i>inception</i> means the beginning or the start. It is important to note that when something is in an incipient stage, there is a chance it will never come to completion. So be on the lookout for incipient trouble or an incipient crisis â€” you might be able to prevent it from happening.</p></div>`;
