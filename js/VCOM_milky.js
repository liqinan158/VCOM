Soapy bathwater, pale skin, and the sap inside some plants can all be described as <i>milky</i>.</p><p class="long">You can use <i>milky</i> to talk about a friend's clear, light complexion, and you can also use it to describe something that has milk in it: "I like my tea sweet and <i>milky</i>." Sometimes you'll find this word describing something that's clouded, like an elderly dog's milky eyes. Our galaxy, in fact, is known as the Milky Way because its shining band of stars can't be individually seen without a telescope, so they appear cloudy or milky.</p></div>`;
