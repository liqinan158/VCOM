Before working hours were regulated in the 1930s, it was more common for bosses to <i>overwork</i> their employees.</p><p class="long">If your family owns a farm, you may feel that your parents overwork you all summer until you go back to school in the fall â€” but there are much more serious cases of employers who overwork their laborers in countries where things like work hours and minimum wage aren't mandated by law. You can use <i>overwork</i> as a noun, too, to mean working too hard or too long: "<i>Overwork</i> made her cranky and tired all the time."</p></div>`;
