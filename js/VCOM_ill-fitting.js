var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">ill-fitting</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Clothes that are <i>ill-fitting</i> are too big or too small â€” or maybe too big in some places, and too small in others. Your <i>ill-fitting</i> pants may require a belt to keep them from falling down.</p><p class="long">An ill-fitting dress might be too short and too tight in the arms, and an ill-fitting suit might be big enough to fit two of you. When something fits, it's the proper size and shape for your body, and when it doesn't fit, it's ill-fitting. This adjective combines <i>ill-</i>, "badly" or "not well," with <i>fitting</i>, from the verb <i>fit</i>, "be fitting or proper" and "be the right shape."</p></div>`;
