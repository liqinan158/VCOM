Colonial America was built by <i>settlers</i> who came mainly from England.</p><p class="long">Settlers often think of themselves as being the first people to live in an area, although through history settlers moved to places already inhabited by native people. A settler's primary goal is to set up a home â€” claim land, build houses, and establish new towns with other settlers. The noun <i>settler</i> originally meant "thing that settles," though by the 1690s it was used to mean "person moving to a new country," from the Old English word <i>setlan</i>, "cause to place."</p></div></div>`;
