Some <i>silverware</i> is actually made of silver, but <i>silverware</i> made of stainless steel is much more common these days.</p><p class="long">If you're eating with a shiny plastic fork, don't call it <i>silverware</i>; call it <i>plasticware</i>. However, if you're eating with a stainless steel fork, you can get away with calling it <i>silverware</i>. Traditionally, fancy cutlery (or silverware) has been made of sterling silver. This is where the word <i>silverware</i> came from in the late 1800s. It's such a common term in the U.S. today that many people use it for knives, forks, spoons, and serving implements no matter what metal they're made of.</p></div></div>`;
