A baby's <i>fretfulness</i> may be caused by hunger, while your <i>fretfulness</i> might come from the big test you have tomorrow.</p><p class="long">Your inability to relax, and that tendency to fidget and snap at people? That's fretfulness. Fretfulness can be caused by anything that provokes worry, irritation, or discomfort, so it's normal to experience fretfulness when you're waiting for news after a big election or watching your favorite basketball team play in overtime. <i>Fretfulness</i> comes from <i>fret</i>, "worry," and its Old English root meaning "devour or consume." So if you're devoured by worry, chalk it up to fretfulness.</p></div>`;
