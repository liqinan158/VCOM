And when a <i>fateful</i> event occurs, it feels like it will have a big impact on your future — and usually not in a good way.</p><p class="long">“I can fit my head into this jar!” — fateful words that resulted in a trip to the hospital. Most of the time, <i>fateful</i> spells disaster. There was the fateful day you left your guinea pig’s cage door open, and there are fateful decisions that seem innocent at the time, but come back to haunt you later. <i>Fate</i> is the idea that your life is mapped out, and a fateful instance is one significant landmark on that map.</p></div></div>`;
