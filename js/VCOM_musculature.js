Your biceps and triceps are part of the <i>musculature</i> of your arm.</p><p class="long"><i>Musculature</i> is just an extra-fancy way for scientists to say "muscles." Zoologists might talk about the musculature of domesticated animals compared with wild animals, for example, and archaeologists may speculate about the musculature of ancient humans. The term includes not only the muscles themselves, but the way they work together in an organism. <i>Musculature</i> shares a root with <i>muscle</i>, the Latin <i>musculus</i>, which means both "a muscle" and "little mouse."</p></div></div>`;
