If your sister gets a three-<i>carat</i> diamond ring, she's getting a ring that weighs 600mg, which is big enough to be called "a rock."</p><p class="long">A variant of <i>carat</i> is <i>karat</i>. The former is usually used with diamonds and is a measure of weight, whereas the latter is usually used for gold and is a measure of purity. One karat is 1/24th of the mass, so 24-karat gold is pure. An 18-karat gold ring is 18/24 (or 3/4) gold and 6/24 (or 1/4) other metals.</p></div></div>`;
