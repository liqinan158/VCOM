You can make your own butter by churning it in a jar if you don't have a churn, shaking heavy cream until it becomes solid. To <i>churn</i> can also simply mean to agitate, like a boat might churn in a turbulent ocean, or your stomach might churn with anxiety about your big test the next day.</p></div>`;
