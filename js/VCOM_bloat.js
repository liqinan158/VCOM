Most often you'll see <i>bloat</i> used to describe things that are filled up with liquid or gas — as in that feeling you get after eating too much. But you might also see the meaning extended to include things like budgets, egos, and expensive shoe collections. Anytime someone has way too much of something, you might see <i>bloat</i> used to describe the situation.</p></div></div>`;
