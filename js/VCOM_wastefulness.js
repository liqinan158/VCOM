To combat <i>wastefulness</i> in the cafeteria, your environmental club might develop a proposal for composting uneaten food and reducing the use of paper napkins.</p><p class="long">Wastefulness takes many forms, from leaving the sink on while you slowly brush your teeth (which wastes water) to lounging for hours in front of a mindless TV show you don't even enjoy (which wastes your valuable time). There's also the wastefulness of a company overpaying for office supplies, or the extravagant wastefulness of a lavish party with ice sculptures, chocolate fountains, and piles of expensive food.</p></div></div>`;
