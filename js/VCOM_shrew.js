Superstitions associated with this small mammal led people in the thirteenth century to use the word <i>shrew</i> to describe a spiteful person, male or female. The word later came to be used to describe a nagging, ill-tempered woman, as in William Shakespeare's <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>. Unless you are a famous dead author, however, you may want to steer clear of this one in conversation: it’s considered offensive.</p></div>`;
