You should never stand on the very top <i>rung</i> of a ladder â€” it can be dangerous!</p><p class="long">From the literal ladder definition of <i>rung</i>, a place to put your foot (or hand) as you climb up, comes the metaphorical meaning of "a level." For example, if you get a promotion at work, you might say you're climbing up the rungs of the company. The horizontal bars between the legs of a chair are also rungs. This word comes from a Germanic root meaning "stake, staff, or bar."</p></div>`;
