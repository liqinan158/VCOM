Depending on the way he goes about it, he might also be known as a snob.</p><p class="long">The Greeks considered an <i>aisthētḗs</i> as "one who feels." It's from this idea of emotional sensitivity that the word <i>aesthete</i> came about in the late 19th Century as a noun for someone who greatly appreciates beauty and the arts.  An aesthete doesn’t have to be wealthy or highly educated. You can be a hotel maid who stops cleaning to absorb a strain of Beethoven and be as much an aesthete as the poet who writes about the splendor of a leaf.</p></div></div>`;
