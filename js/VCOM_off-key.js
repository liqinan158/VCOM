If your jazz band is <i>off-key</i> from the first note of their first song, it'll make the audience cringe.</p><p class="long">You might not care if your friends are off-key when they sing "Happy Birthday" and present you with a chocolate cake, but you may want to get your money back if you buy expensive tickets to hear an orchestra play off-key renditions of Bach and Beethoven. This musical meaning inspired the figurative <i>off-key</i>, meaning "not fitting" or "clashing": "The mayor's big-city values are <i>off-key</i> in our little village."</p></div>`;
