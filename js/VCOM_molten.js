You're probably familiar with lava, the <i>molten</i> rock that explodes out of a volcano.</p><p class="long"><i>Molten</i> originated from the Old English verb <i>meltian</i>, meaning "become liquid." It takes incredibly high temperatures to get an object that was once rock solid to be transformed into a liquid state. Something much safer than lava has made the term <i>molten</i> popular â€” molten chocolate cake. This cake has a center that's filled with hot, gooey pudding-like chocolate that oozes out. This is probably the only molten thing you'd ever want to touch.</p></div>`;
