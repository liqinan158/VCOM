You could call each one an <i>ingénue</i>, or a young female character in literature or film who is wholesome and innocent.</p><p class="long"><i>Ingénue</i> comes from the French <i>ingénu</i> meaning "ingenuous, innocent." The term is used to describe the innocent girl stock character in film or literature. She's usually gentle, sweet, virginal, and pretty naive — which makes her susceptible to the harsh dangers of the world. <i>Ingénue</i> can also be used to describe an actress who specializes in playing this kind of character specifically.</p></div></div>`;
