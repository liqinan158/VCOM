To <i>omit</i> something is to leave it out, to forget or overlook it.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>omit</i> comes from the Latin word <i>omittere</i>, "to let go or to lay aside," which is exactly what it means. When you omit an ingredient you need for your brownie recipe from the grocery list, you've accidentally left off an important item. You can also deliberately omit something, which you'd do if you didn't include your least favorite cousin when you invited your relatives to a family reunion.</p></div></div>`;
