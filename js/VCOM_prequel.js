Filmmakers sometimes like to fill in background information with a prequel, though fans often complain that prequels don't live up to the original (think of the original Star Wars films and their prequels, for example). The earliest known use of <i>prequel</i> described a 1958 installment of a science fiction story, and the word was common by the 1970s.</p></div></div>`;
