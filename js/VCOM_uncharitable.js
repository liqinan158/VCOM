It would be <i>uncharitable</i> to throw away your unopened bag of chips when your friend just mentioned how hungry she is.</p><p class="long">Uncharitable behavior includes things like gossiping meanly about others, refusing to offer someone a ride when you're heading in the same direction, or hoarding your vast amounts of wealth rather than donating some of it to charity. In fact, the noun <i>charity</i> is at the heart of this adjective â€” as well as "an organization that provides help," it means "voluntarily giving help" and "kindness." When you don't show charity, you're uncharitable.</p></div>`;
