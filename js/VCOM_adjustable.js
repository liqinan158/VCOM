A car's <i>adjustable</i> seat can accommodate both very tall and very short drivers.</p><p class="long">Most belts are adjustable â€” you can make them larger or smaller depending on the size of your waist. Seat belts and ball caps are also adjustable, so that they conform to different bodies and heads. When a loan or mortgage from a bank is described as <i>adjustable</i>, it means that the interest rate changes periodically. The verb <i>adjust</i> came first, from the Old French <i>ajouter</i>, "to join," based on the Late Latin <i>adiuxtare</i>, "to bring near."</p></div></div>`;
