Your front door shuts securely in between two <i>jambs</i>.</p><p class="long">When a house builder frames a doorway, she sets two jambs at the sides of the opening, with what's called a <i>lintel</i> at the top. The door fits between the jambs. Windows have jambs too â€” if you replace your existing windows, you may need a whole new frame, including new jambs. The Old French origin is <i>jambe</i>, which means "pier or side post," but was originally "a leg or a shank," from the Late Latin <i>gamba</i>, "leg."</p></div>`;
