If youâ€™re superstitious, you might think that seeing a black cat is an <i>augury</i> of bad luck.</p><p class="long">The word <i>augury</i> used to refer to a way of predicting the future by watching birds fly. These days, if a flock of birds flies over your car, that could simply be an augury that your car is going to be, um, decorated. Not every augury is an ill omen, but usually an augury is a sign that the future will be none too rosy. Auguries are signs of what's to come, and it's wise not to ignore them.</p></div></div>`;
