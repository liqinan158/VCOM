Randomly, <i>sport</i> can also mean to wear, as in, "he looked sharp <i>sporting</i> a yellow <i>sport</i> coat."</p><p class="long">Most of the definitions of <i>sport</i> involve the idea of fun, or of something being fair. Hopefully organized sports are both. A sporting chance means a player in a game has a fair chance of winning. A good sport is someone who plays fair, and wins and loses graciously. If you torture flies for sport, you do it for fun, and that's just wrong. If you make sport of your little sister's stutter, you make fun of it, and that's even worse.</p></div></div>`;
