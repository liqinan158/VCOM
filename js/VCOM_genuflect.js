Politicians are experts at <i>genuflecting</i> to whatever idea or person is most popular at the time.</p><p class="long">In the old days, when you came in front of your social superiors, you were expected to genuflect: that is, bend your knee and bow submissively. You did it before kings and nobles, and everyone did it in church before God. In our more egalitarian age, <i>genuflecting</i> has taken on a rather insincere and servile meaning. Best not to genuflect, but simply to admire.</p></div>`;
