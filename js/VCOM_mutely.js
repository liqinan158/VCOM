If you can't carry a tune, you might sit <i>mutely</i> while everyone else sings "Happy Birthday" to your sister.</p><p class="long">The adverb <i>mutely</i> is similar to <i>silently</i>, or "making no noise at all," except that it refers specifically to speech. If you don't talk or vocalize, you are mute, so if you smile mutely at your best friend, you don't speak to her at all. Both <i>mute</i> and <i>mutely</i> come from the Latin <i>mutus</i>, "silent or speechless."</p></div></div>`;
