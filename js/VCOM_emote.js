If an actor doesn't <i>emote</i>, the audience can't tell how he's supposed to be feeling in a scene.</p><p class="long">When people emote, it sometimes appears overdone or melodramatic. Taking a feeling and exaggerating it so that an audience can understand the character's emotions is what actors do when they emote. The noun <i>emotion</i> came first, and the theatrical verb <i>emote</i> followed in the early twentieth century. The Old French root word is <i>emouvoir</i>, or "stir up," from the Latin <i>emovere</i>, "move out, remove, or agitate."</p></div>`;
