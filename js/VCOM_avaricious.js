The suggestion is that an <i>avaricious</i> person will do anything to achieve material gain, and it is, in general, not a pleasant attribute.</p><p class="long">The Latin verb <i>avēre</i>, meaning "to crave" provides the groundwork for the word <i>avaricious</i> and its definition as "greedy or covetous." The adjective is applied to anyone who "craves" great wealth, and suggests that desire for personal gain is an overriding influence in the avaricious person's life. The widespread quality of this selfishness was cleverly noted by Voltaire, who wrote, “Men hate the individual whom they call avaricious only because nothing can be gained from him.”</p></div></div>`;
