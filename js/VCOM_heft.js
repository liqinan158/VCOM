You might shift the <i>heft</i> of that huge bag of dog food you just bought over to your left arm while you use your right hand to open the door.</p><p class="long">The heft of your big suitcase might make you question the wisdom of packing so many books. You can use <i>heft</i> as a verb, too â€” you could move the books into your backpack and then heft it back onto your shoulder. <i>Heft</i> comes from the verb <i>heave</i>, "lift with effort," modeled on verb/noun combinations like "thieve" and "theft" or "weave" and "weft."</p></div>`;
