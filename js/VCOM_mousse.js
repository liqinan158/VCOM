Don't confuse the dessert <i>mousse</i> with the foamy hair product also called <i>mousse</i>, or else people will want to nibble on your hair after dinner.</p><p class="long">If you have heavy cream, some eggs, and flavoring — plus a whisk or an electric mixer — you can make mousse. Most mousses are sweet, flavored with chocolate or fruit or peanut butter, but it's also possible to cook a savory mousse, like a salmon mousse or a chicken liver mousse. Because its texture is similar to these foods, the foamy hair product is also called <i>mousse</i>. In Old French, <i>mousse</i> means "froth," but also, unappetizingly, "scum."</p></div>`;
