The adjective form of <i>variable</i> has been around since the late 1300s, applying first to people, and then, in the late 1400s, to weather. The noun form first appeared in Lacroix's <i>Differential and Integral Calculus</i> in 1816, guaranteeing that math students would be solving for the variable x for generations to come.</p></div></div>`;
