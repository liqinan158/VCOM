You might accidentally <i>misguide</i> a tourist by instructing him to turn left when he should have gone right.</p><p class="long">Use the verb <i>misguide</i> when you point someone in the wrong direction, either literally or in a figurative way: "I didn't mean to <i>misguide</i> you when I promised you'd love camping in the desert." Giving bad advice is one way to misguide someone, and giving bad driving directions is another. In the fourteenth century, <i>misguide</i> meant "to go astray," rather than "to lead someone else astray."</p></div></div>`;
