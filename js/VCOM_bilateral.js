Discussions between two political parties are called <i>bilateral</i> because both sides get to share their views.</p><p class="long"><i>Bilateral</i> comes from Latin: <i>bi</i> means "two" and <i>lateralis</i> means "belonging to the side." Debates about issues can be described as bilateral â€” as long as people on both sides get to speak. However, <i>bilateral</i> can describe anything with two sides, like some of the organs in the body: the brain, heart and lungs all have two distinct sides.</p></div>`;
