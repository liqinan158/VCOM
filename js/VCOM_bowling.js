The ball you roll is called a <i>bowling</i> ball.</p><p class="long">Bowling classically involves very heavy balls that are rolled down the polished wood of a lane, with open gutters at each side, toward the ten pins arranged at the end. Other versions of bowling have smaller balls, differently shaped pins, and different numbers of pins â€” but the goal is always to knock as many of them over as possible. The game was originally known as "playing at bowls."</p></div>`;
