An <i>affair</i> is a specific event.</p><p class="long">You can use <i>affair</i> as a kind of shorthand, to mean "that big mess," or "that complicated story I already told you about." Your <i>affair</i> can also mean your responsibility or job, like if your grandmother said, "I don't care about balloons for the party â€” that's your <i>affair</i>." Another way <i>affair</i> is frequently used is to mean a love affair, particularly if the relationship is brief and intense. This meaning comes from the French phrase <i>affaire de coeur</i>, "<i>affair</i> of the heart."</p></div></div>`;
