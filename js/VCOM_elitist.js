If you wear only the finest silk suits, expect caviar at every meal, and refuse to speak to anyone who doesn't have a PhD, then you might be an <i>elitist.</i></p><p class="long">A fairly recent addition to the English language, the noun <i>elitist</i>, came about from a mix of <i>elite</i> + <i>ist</i> in 1950. Carlyle, Freud, and Nietzsche were all considered to be the original elitists. <i>Elite</i>, from which <i>elitist</i> was formed, evolved much earlier, in 1823, from the French <i>élite</i>, meaning “selection, choice.” Synonyms for <i>elitist</i> include <i>highbrow</i>, <i>pompous person</i>, <i>social climber</i>, and <i>stuffed shirt</i>.</p></div></div>`;
