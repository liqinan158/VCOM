A <i>hydroponic</i> tomato was probably grown using liquid nutrients, inside a greenhouse.</p><p class="long">The word <i>hydroponic</i> comes from two Greek roots: <i>hydro-</i>, or "water," and <i>ponein</i>, "to labor, work, or toil." When the work of growing a plant involves special nutrients dissolved in water rather than conventional beds in soil, that plant is hydroponic. Sometimes the roots of hydroponic plants are suspended in liquid, but often other non-soil materials like gravel or coir are used.</p></div>`;
