Another type of <i>match</i> places people together instead of opposing one another. Perhaps you'll find your perfect <i>match</i> on an online dating web site.</p><p class="long">You might cheer at a boxing match or challenge your friend to a tennis match. Another kind of match is a pair of things that go together or are equal: "His zombie costume was a perfect <i>match</i> with his best friend's." There's also the match you strike to start a fire: "She lit the candle with a <i>match</i>." This match has a Greek root meaning "lamp wick," while other matches come from the Proto-Germanic <i>gamakon</i>, "fitting together."</p></div></div>`;
