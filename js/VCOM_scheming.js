So something described as scheming has the quality of secretive planning. For example, you might offer to keep your mom company on a long drive to drop off a relative at the airport because on the way home, you plan to ask her to stop at the big shopping mall that's right off the highway. That's the essence of being scheming â€” you conceal your true intentions because you believe it will help you get what you want.</p></div>`;
