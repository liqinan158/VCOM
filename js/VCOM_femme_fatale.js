A <i>femme fatale</i> usually means trouble for the men who fall for her seductive ways.</p><p class="long">Use the noun <i>femme fatale</i> to describe the character in your mystery novel who uses her mysterious beauty to seduce the detective hero into nearly making a terrible mistake. It's a term that has been used in English since the 1880s, and it comes from the French <i>femme</i>, "woman," and the Latin <i>fatale</i>, literally "decreed by fate," but in this case meaning something closer to "disastrous." Famous literary femmes fatales include Medea and Catwoman.</p></div>`;
