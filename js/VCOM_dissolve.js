var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">dissolve</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>dissolve</i> something is to break it up or weaken it, making it no longer recognizable. You could <i>dissolve</i> your book club or you could even dissolve a pill by dropping it into a glass of water.</p><p class="long">You can use the verb <i>dissolve</i> to describe things that are coming apart or diminishing. <i>Dissolve</i> goes back to the Latin root <i>dissolvere,</i> meaning "to loosen," and it came into English in the 14th century. Physical objects <i>dissolve</i>, as when bubbles dissolve in the tub or a cube of sugar will dissolve in hot tea, and intangible, or non-physical, things can fade away too: "Their friendship started to dissolve when he moved across country and they communicated less frequently."</p></div></div>`;
