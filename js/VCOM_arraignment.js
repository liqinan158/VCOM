The trial comes next.</p><p class="long"><i>Arraignment</i> comes from the French word <i>aresnier</i>, which means to address, or speak reasonably. It's almost only used in the legal sense as answering for yourself, or <i>pleading</i>, "guilty" or "not guilty." The verb <i>arraign</i> means to call someone before the court to answer an accusation (called in legal speak, an <i>indictment</i>), so an arraignment is either the piece of paper that calls you to court, or the hearing in which that charge is read to you.</p></div>`;
