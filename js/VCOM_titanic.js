This means it took a large amount of force and power to do so.</p><p class="long">The root word <i>titan</i> is derived from Greek mythology. The Titans were a race of powerful deities. The adjective <i>titanic</i> can now refer to anything extremely large or strong. <i>The Titanic</i> was the name of the famous cruise ship that sank in 1912 after hitting an iceberg in the Atlantic Ocean. This name was chosen not only because it was the largest passenger steamship of its time, but also because it was touted as a strong ship, specifically that it was “unsinkable.”</p></div></div>`;
