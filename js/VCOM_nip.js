It’s also a verb for pinching or biting something, but not always in a bad way.</p><p class="long">Being nipped now and then isn’t a big deal. If a puppy nips your finger, no worries. The cold morning nip when you get out of bed is uncomfortable, but put on socks and you’re fine. Nipping can be a good thing sometimes, like in the phrase “<i>nip</i> it in the bud,” which means stopping a poor behavior or activity when it first starts. A <i>nip</i> can also mean a small sip of something, like hot chocolate — which is a good idea if you’re feeling a nip of a cold draft.</p></div></div>`;
