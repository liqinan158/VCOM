Some gardeners plant specific flowers that attract <i>butterflies</i>.</p><p class="long">Butterflies are closely related to moths, which also have wings that are large in proportion to their bodies and antennae. A butterfly is distinctive because of its relatively large size and lovely, patterned wings. After hatching, they start as caterpillars, and eventually build a chrysalis, inside of which they transform into — and emerge as — a butterfly. The origin of <i>butterfly</i> isn't certain, though it may come from some butterflies' pale yellow color.</p></div></div>`;
