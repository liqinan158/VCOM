You can make lasagna with <i>bechamel</i> instead of the more traditional tomato sauce.</p><p class="long">Another name for bechamel — or <i>béchamel</i> — is "white sauce." Making a bechamel is a very basic technique in French cooking which begins with a roux, a cooked mixture of flour and butter, and after slowly whisking in milk, ends in a creamy sauce. The word <i>bechamel</i> comes from the name of a servant of King Louis XIV of France, Louis de Béchamel, who is said to have invented it in the 17th century.</p></div></div>`;
