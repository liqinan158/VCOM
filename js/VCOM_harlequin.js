A <i>harlequin</i> is a classic comic pantomime character.</p><p class="long">In traditional pantomime, a comic performance with silent actors, a harlequin is a funny character who wears a mask and a distinctive diamond-patterned costume. The word <i>harlequin</i> sometimes describes bright, many-colored colored things, like a <i>harlequin</i> circus tent. The oldest versions of the word <i>harlequin</i> â€” the Middle Dutch <i>hellekijn</i> and the Old French <i>hellequin</i>, reference <i>Hell</i> and mean a kind of <i>demon</i>. In the translation from French to English, the harlequin lost his demonic quality and became a clown.</p></div>`;
