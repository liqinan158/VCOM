In science classes, a <i>solute</i> might be part of your experiment.</p><p class="long">Pronounced "SAHL-yoot," the noun <i>solute</i> has close word relatives in <i>dissolve</i>, <i>soluble</i>, and <i>solid</i> â€” all of which are rooted in the Latin word <i>solvere</i>, meaning "to loosen." A solute changes state when it is dissolved. In sugar water, the solute is the sugar because it changes from solid to liquid. The water is not a solute.</p></div></div>`;
