The ones who eat an extreme amount have the quality of voracity â€” basically, it means overeating. Sometimes this word refers to literally eating too much, and other times it refers to the desire to overeat. Anyone might eat a couple of hot dogs, but only someone with voracity could eat ten or eleven in one sitting. At the root of <i>voracity</i> is the Latin word <i>vorare</i>, which means "to devour."</p></div>`;
