Your intelligence helps you pass math class and learn French. It means smarts — what you need at least some of to get through school. <i>Intelligence</i> has an exciting double life: it also refers to what spies are trying to get — information from the enemy. You can be born with it, or acquire it, especially if you're in the CIA.</p></div>`;
