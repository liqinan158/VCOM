If your canoe is <i>awash</i> with seawater, it's time to start bailing.</p><p class="long">A beach might be awash during high tide, and your beach cottage could be awash after a tropical rain. The decks of a boat are often described as being awash during a storm, flooded with water. Things can be figuratively awash, too: "The movie premiere was awash with photographers and fans." <i>Awash</i> was originally a nautical word meaning "flush with," from the 15th-century meaning of <i>wash</i>, "land alternately covered and exposed by the sea."</p></div></div>`;
