Since you are a <i>polite</i> dinner guest, you thank the host for inviting you and, even though you think the chicken is not cooked to perfection, you tell her you are enjoying the meal.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>polite</i> comes from the mid-13th century Latin <i>politus</i>, which means "refined" or "elegant." Showing consideration for others, using tact, and observing social norms are the qualities of being polite. The opposite of <i>polite</i> is <i>rude</i>. Because the poet E.E. Cummings thought imagination is most important, he wrote, “Knowledge is a <i>polite</i> word for dead but not buried imagination.”</p></div></div>`;
