The goal of <i>collective bargaining</i> is to reach an agreement that's acceptable to both sides.</p><p class="long">Most collective bargaining happens with the help of a labor union or other organized group representing employees. Typically, the union speaks on behalf of the workers it represents, laying out their requests (like wages, benefits, working hours, and safety, and other issues). Collective bargaining can result in improvements at a single company, but sometimes it leads to better working conditions in an entire industry.</p></div>`;
