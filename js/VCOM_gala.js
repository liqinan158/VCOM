If you're going to a <i>gala,</i> you'll want to wear your fanciest ball gown — you'll want to look great for the best party of the year.</p><p class="long">A gala often features entertainment and dinner, and sometimes dancing and an auction. It's like a prom — but for adults. If you want to raise money for your favorite hospital, or museum, or theater, you could throw a gala, charge people a lot to attend, and give your profits to the charity. A gala can also be just a big celebration, like a gala dinner before the Oscars ceremony. <i>Gala</i> is from the Old French <i>gale,</i> "rejoicing."</p></div></div>`;
