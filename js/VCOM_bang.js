Hearing a <i>bang</i> outside your house at night might make your dog start barking.</p><p class="long">The sharp sound of a bang might be made by someone pounding on your front door, or two cars colliding. A <i>bang</i> can also be a painful physical knock, like a bang on your head when you crash your bike. You can use it as a verb as well: "Don't <i>bang</i> your laptop down on the table â€” you'll break it!" <i>Bang</i> shares a Scandinavian root with the Old Norse <i>banga</i>, "to pound."</p></div>`;
