It could be an extra layer of tinsel on an already flashy Christmas tree or a second lengthy apology after the first one was accepted.</p><p class="long">You could probably argue that the word <i>supererogatory</i> might be, well, supererogatory. After all, the word <i>superfluous</i> is very close in meaning. And you might notice that <i>excessive</i> is a shorter, more common synonym for both of those words. Necessary or not, if you encounter <i>supererogatory</i> just remember that it means "too much," even to the point of creating a slightly bad impression.</p></div>`;
