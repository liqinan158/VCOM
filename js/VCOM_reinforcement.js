In addition to strengthening walls, <i>reinforcement</i> can refer to the strengthening or propping up of an argument or a particular point of view. For example, if you show up in class every day and ask questions, that adds <i>reinforcement</i> to the notion that you’re a diligent student.</p></div></div>`;
