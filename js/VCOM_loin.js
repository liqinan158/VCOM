A low-slung belt hangs more or less along your <i>loin</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Loin</i> often refers generally to a person's body below their ribs, though rarely by doctors (who like to get more specific). At the butcher, though, it means a particular cut of meat, usually beef or pork, from an animal's low back and side. This is the earliest meaning of the word, which comes from the Old French <i>loigne</i>, "hip or haunch." In the Bible, <i>loin</i> means "part of the body that should be covered with clothing."</p></div></div>`;
