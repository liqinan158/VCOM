Think of one of those cute-homely troll dolls — blend those two words together — "doll" and "troll" — and you get <i>droll</i>, a description of a figure that is adorably strange and whimsically cute.</p><p class="long">The word <i>droll</i> comes from the archaic French word <i>drolle</i>, referring to a jolly good fellow. The French word comes perhaps from the Middle Dutch <i>drolle</i>, or "imp." The word came into English as both noun ("funny person, buffoon") and adjective ("funny, quaint, strange") in the 17th century.</p></div>`;
