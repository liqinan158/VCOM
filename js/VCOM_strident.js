Your roommate's <i>strident</i> laughter as he watches cartoons late into the night might inspire you to buy a pair of ear plugs.</p><p class="long"><i>Strident</i> is related to the Latin word <i>strix </i>, meaning "screech owl." This is a kind of owl that doesn't hoot. It screeches in a strident way. <i>Strident</i> can also describe the forceful expression of an unpopular opinion. Don't confuse <i>strident</i> with <i>striding</i>, which means walking quickly with a wide step. If you're angry at your brother, you might come striding into his room and begin making a strident case for why he has done you wrong.</p></div>`;
