Making a momentous life decision with great uncertainty, like enrolling in clown college, might feel like jumping into the <i>abyss</i>.</p><p class="long">Traditionally, <i>the abyss</i> referred to the "bottomless pit" of Hell. Now it might refer to either a literal chasm or a figurative one: "Thirty years ago, we peered into this abyss and pulled back just in time." The word is sometimes used to describe a wide difference between cultures or nations. <i>Abyss</i> comes from Greek: <i>a-</i> "without" + <i>byssos</i>, "depth, bottom."
