If you read mystery novels, you know that a body is often <i>unidentifiable</i>, but the detective figures out who it is by the end of the book and solves the crime.</p><p class="long">People aren't the only things that can be <i>unidentifiable</i>. You may see an unidentifiable car â€” one that is nondescript and has no specific markings or license plates. You may have a refrigerator full of unidentifiable packages, especially if all the labels are missing. It's always best not to leave things in the fridge for months before you try to identify them.</p></div>`;
