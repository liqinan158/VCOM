var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">homicide</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The noun <i>homicide</i> means a murder. If you kill another person, you are committing a <i>homicide</i>. The level of the <i>homicide</i> is legally defined as murder if the act was intentional and as manslaughter if it was unintentional.</p><p class="long">Remember the meaning of <i>homicide</i> by remembering that <i>cide</i>, from the Latin <i>cida</i>, refers to killing, while the Latin <i>homo</i> means "man.” So <i>homicide</i> means “killing a man.”  You can see another example in this quote from Oliver Wendell Holmes: “Life and language are alike sacred. Homicide and verbicide — that is, violent treatment of a word with fatal results to its legitimate meaning, which is its life — are alike forbidden.”</p></div>`;
