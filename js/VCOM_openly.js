Some countries allow their citizens to <i>openly</i> criticize the government, while other countries harshly punish their critics.</p><p class="long">There might be some things you prefer to keep to yourself, or to whisper about with your best friend. Or, maybe you're a person who prefers to live your life openly, being direct and straightforward about everything. Talking openly about your feelings can be hard, but it usually makes you feel better. <i>Openly</i> comes from the Old English <i>openlice</i>, "clearly or unreservedly."</p></div>`;
