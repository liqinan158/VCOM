It can also be a silly goof done on purpose to make people laugh, like slipping on a banana peel.</p><p class="long">A pratfall originally referred to a fall on your butt, which was often done by comic actors for laughs. From there, it came to mean all sorts of unplanned screw-ups. A restaurant caught serving horsemeat has committed a pratfall. A politicianâ€™s inappropriate joke is a verbal pratfall. A football player who runs the wrong way and scores for the other team has done a pratfall. Oops!</p></div></div>`;
