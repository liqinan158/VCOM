You might cook a casserole in your favorite pot, made of blue <i>enamel</i>.</p><p class="long">Enamel is used in all kinds of everyday objects, including the surface of washing machines, baking dishes, and some bath tubs. The enamel itself is made from melted powdered glass, which can easily be fused to metal and other surfaces. The outer part of your teeth is also known as enamel, and though sugar and other foods can decay it, your tooth enamel is actually the strongest, hardest substance in your body.</p></div></div>`;
