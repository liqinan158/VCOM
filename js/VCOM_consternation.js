It comes from the Latin roots <i>con</i>- and -<i>sternare</i>, which means "spread out." Picture all of your thoughts strewn about, nothing makes sense and you might experience a state of <i>consternation</i>. Like the nightmare about the class you forgot to go to in high school and now you have to take the final exam!</p></div>`;
