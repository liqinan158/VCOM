You might decide it's time for a <i>haircut</i> when your bangs are hanging in your eyes.</p><p class="long">Some people go to fancy salons for a haircut, while others visit a barber or trust a friend to give them a haircut. You can call the resulting style — the layered sides or shaved neck — a <i>haircut</i> too. If your haircut is striking or unusual, like a spiky purple Mohawk, you'll probably get lots of comments and admiring glances. The haircut is believed to date from A.U.C. 454, in ancient Rome.</p></div>`;
