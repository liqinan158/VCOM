A typical prism is triangular in shape, and when white light (like sunlight) is shown through it, the prism breaks the light into separate colors and displays it as a rainbow (color spectrum). Sir Isaac Newton experimented with prisms in the 1600s, and his work was the beginning of the modern period of both optics and the understanding of light.</p></div>`;
