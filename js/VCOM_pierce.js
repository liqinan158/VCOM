To <i>pierce</i> means to go right through, especially with something sharp.</p><p class="long"><i>Pierce</i> has several meanings, but they all involve something sharp penetrating something else, like scissors through a plastic bag or a pen through a pocket. You can also pierce confusion by saying something that makes everything clear. Another meaning has to do with sound. Much like a knife, a sharp sound can pierce the silence and a loud, high shriek will pierce your ears.</p></div></div>`;
