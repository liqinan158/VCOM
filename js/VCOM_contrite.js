The word comes from the Latin roots <i>com</i>- meaning "together" and <i>terere</i> which means "to rub." It's also related to the Latin word <i>conterere</i> and is defined as "to bruise." In the field of theology being <i>contrite</i> is "being remorseful for past sin and resolved to avoid future sin."</p></div></div>`;
