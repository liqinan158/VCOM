People who are full of <i>whimsy</i> are odd, but often fanciful and lovely, like Harry Potter's friend Luna Lovegood.</p><p class="long">Whimsy is also a whim — something you do just because you want to. If you find a postcard of Alaska and take that as a reason to move there, that could qualify as whimsy. Whimsy is irrational, but playful. If you decorate your house with whimsy, you may have a wall decorated with butterflies and giant daisies with googly eyes, and a couch trimmed with peacock feathers and vinyl. It's amusing and witty, and you’re a master of whimsy.</p></div>`;
