Your huge collection of animal salt and pepper shakers is nothing but <i>trumpery</i>.</p><p class="long">Trumpery is typically fun to look at, but not very practical or worth very much. Many collectible objects are trumpery, like the dolls your grandma buys to display throughout her house or the cheap plastic jewelry your sister always spends her allowance on. Another kind of trumpery is equally useless or worthless speech, whether it's written or spoken. <i>Trumpery</i> comes from the Old French <i>tromperie</i>, with its root of <i>tromper</i>, "to deceive."</p></div></div>`;
