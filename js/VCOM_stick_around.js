Your sister could decide to stick around after your debate to find out if you've won any prizes, and your dog might be the well-trained sort who will stick around at the park even if you take his leash off. This common slang phrase has been around since the early 1900's, from the sense of <i>stick</i> meaning "to cling, or to stay close by."</p></div>`;
