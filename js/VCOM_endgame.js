The last few moves you make in your chess game are your <i>endgame</i>.</p><p class="long">Although the term <i>endgame</i> doesn't have a formal definition in chess, it's long been used by players to describe what happens when very few pieces are left on the board. One interesting thing characteristic of a chess endgame is that the king, which spends most of the game being protected by other pieces, becomes much stronger. From the chess meaning, <i>endgame</i> is also used figuratively to mean "end stages of negotiation."</p></div>`;
