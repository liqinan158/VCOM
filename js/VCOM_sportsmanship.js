If you never cheat or act rude while playing a game, you are modeling good <i>sportsmanship</i>.</p><p class="long">Sportsmanship has to do with how people play games, not if they win or lose games. You could win and have terrible sportsmanship if you cheated, yelled at the referees, or refused to shake hands after the game. Sportsmanship has to do with fairness and manners; both winners and losers can be good or bad sportsmen. Women show sportsmanship too, of course. If you have good sportsmanship, you respect the game, your teammates, the other team, and the fans too.</p></div>`;
