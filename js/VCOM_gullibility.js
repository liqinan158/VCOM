Someone with a lot of <i>gullibility</i> can be easily tricked.</p><p class="long">There's an old joke: "Did you know <i>gullible</i> isn't in the dictionary?" If you say "Really?" in response, then you are proving to be gullible: a little too ready to believe what you hear. The word for this quality or tendency is <i>gullibility</i>. Being superstitious shows gullibility. Believing tabloid newspapers shows gullibility. Falling easily for jokes and pranks shows gullibility. People with high gullibility are a little too trusting: theyâ€™re not suspicious of anyone.</p></div></div>`;
