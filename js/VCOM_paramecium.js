That's how small a paramecium is: it only consists of one cell. To look at a paramecium, you'd better have a powerful microscope. The shape of a paramecium has been compared to a slipper or other type of shoe. Paramecia — that's the plural form — are found in freshwater and feed on other extremely small organisms.</p></div></div>`;
