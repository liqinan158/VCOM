If it slithers around on its belly, a herpetologist will know what it is.</p><p class="long">The word <i>herpetologist</i> comes from the Greek root <i>herpeton</i> meaning "creeping animal." When a herpetologist goes out searching for reptiles and amphibians, he is herping, or peeking under rocks and in the mud, hoping to find a slithery creature lingering there. What will he find? Turtles, snakes, alligators, salamanders, etc. These reptiles and amphibians are a herpetologist's forte.</p></div>`;
