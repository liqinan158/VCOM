If your dingy hits a sharp rock, it may spring a leak, <i>keel over</i>, and sink.</p><p class="long">When a boat keels over, It tips and starts to take on water â€” it capsizes. When a lamp or a llama keels over, it falls abruptly: "Stay away from the statues at the museum; things seem to <i>keel over</i> whenever you're near them." And if a person keels over, they slump to the ground, pass out, or collapse: "Once one blood donor fainted, the others started to <i>keel over</i> too." The nautical meaning came first, in the nineteenth century.</p></div>`;
