You can make <i>sculpture</i> from clay, marble, wood, and even mashed potatoes, though the potato kind might not make it into an art museum.</p><p class="long">From the Latin <i>sculpere</i> "to carve," <i>sculpture</i> often is carved out of a block of wood, stone, or other material. Statues and outdoor artworks are one type of sculpture, and they are freestanding â€” you can walk around them, under them, or even over them. Other types are carved into walls, with the figures or objects sticking out from a flat surface. Artists called sculptors use soft materials, metal, and even ice and common objects like cars and cans to make sculpture.</p></div>`;
