Look closely at the word: you can break it down to "at," "one," and "ment."  <i>Atonement</i> first appears in English in the 1510s, when it meant "the condition of being at one (with others)." About ten years later, the word shows up with a meaning that included “being at one with God.”</p></div></div>`;
