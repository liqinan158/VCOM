A <i>yard</i> is often surrounded by a fence or marked by shrubs or other plants. As a unit of measurement, a <i>yard</i> is equal to three feet.</p><p class="long">Most suburban houses have both a front yard and a back yard â€” sometimes side yards too. Yards might have grass, trees, bushes, play structures, gardens, patios, and decks. A completely different kind of yard is the unit of measurement that equals three feet. This three-foot yard comes from a Germanic root meaning "rod or staff," while the yard behind your house has a root that means "to enclose."</p></div>`;
