The <i>perpetuation</i> of your childhood memories is helped by looking at old photographs.</p><p class="long">The perpetuation of a family's genes happens when people have children, and the perpetuation of oppression occurs when one dictator after another seizes control of a country's government. When something is made to last longer or is continued, some kind of perpetuation is going on. Both the noun and related verb <i>perpetuate</i> come from a Latin root, <i>perpetuus</i>, which means "continuous or universal."</p></div>`;
