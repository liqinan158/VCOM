You might <i>vacillate</i> between ordering waffles and pancakes at your favorite diner — it’s hard to pick just one when both are so tasty!</p><p class="long">Something that <i>vacillates</i> sways or fluctuates, often quite unsteadily. So use this verb to describe the staggering motions of a person who has had too much to drink, as well as the opinions of someone who can’t make up her mind. Synonyms include <i>vibrate</i>, <i>hesitate</i>, and <i>waver</i>. A wise Ethiopian proverb advises, "Do not vacillate or you will be left in between doing something, having something, and being nothing.”</p></div>`;
