A <i>teleological</i> statement you've probably heard before is "everything happens for a reason."</p><p class="long"><i>Teleological</i> comes from the Greek roots <i>telos</i> "end" or "purpose" and <i>-ology</i> "study of." So teleology and teleological arguments try to explain the result (for example, the complexity and seeming order of the universe) by postulating a purpose. If you take a teleological view of humanity, you think human life has purpose and is moving toward some goal.</p></div></div>`;
