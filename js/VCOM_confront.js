Rather than letting things go, when people are rude to you you should <i>confront</i> them.</p><p class="long"><i>Confront</i> derives from the Latin <i>con-</i> "with" and <i>-front</i> "front." You can confront a sad truth, you can confront a person by calling them on their behavior, you can confront someone with the fact that they have terrible breath. You can be confronted, tooâ€”on the trip through the mountains, we were confronted by the impassibility of the road.</p></div>`;
