They all have a delicate weakness or vulnerability and seem to require some kind of care.</p><p class="long">The Old French <i>fraileté</i>, or "weakness" is the root of <i>frailty</i>, and it in turn comes from the Latin word for "fragile," <i>fragilis</i>. What's interesting is that "fragility" was used in the 14th century to mean a kind of moral, rather than physical, weakness. Today <i>frailty</i> can be used this way too, to describe a state of having shaky — or fragile — morals.</p></div></div>`;
