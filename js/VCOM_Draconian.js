So rules that are too restrictive — or just plain unfair — are called <i>Draconian</i>. Sentencing someone to 10 years in prison for littering would be Draconian. Some people think Singapore's chewing gum ban is Draconian. This is a strong word, so if your parents make you do chores, they aren't being Draconian. But if they make you do chores for five hours every day, that's another story.</p></div>`;
