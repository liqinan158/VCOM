If you are having trouble with your computer network, you might have to call in a network <i>technician</i> to get it sorted out.</p><p class="long">A technician knows all of the ins and outs (the technicalities) of a specific process. A computer technician knows all about how computers work and how to fix them. Likewise an automotive technician (a mechanic) knows all about cars and how to fix them. <i>Technician</i> is not always associated with technology. If a painter or a musician is trained in various artistic, or musical techniques, he or she can also be called a technician.</p></div>`;
