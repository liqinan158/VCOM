You might <i>enfold</i> a baby in a blanket, or <i>enfold</i> a puppy in your arms.</p><p class="long">When you enfold something, you either wrap it in a cloth or covering, or you mimic this action literally — with your arms — or figuratively. You could say, for example, that as you walk home at sunset, the night begins to enfold your neighborhood. Or you can say that you love when your grandma enfolds you in a hug. The verb <i>enfold</i> combines the prefix <i>en-</i>, "make or put in" with <i>fold</i>.</p></div>`;
