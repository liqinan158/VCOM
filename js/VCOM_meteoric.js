A newly-popular singer might be said to experience a <i>meteoric</i> rise to the top. (The fall can be <i>meteoric</i>, too.)</p><p class="long">The "-ic" suffix on a word creates an adjective meaning "with the characteristics of." So <i>meteoric</i> means “having the characteristics of a meteor.” Both words take their origin from the Greek <i>meteōros</i>, meaning "high up." By the way, a shooting star is <i>meteoric</i>, being a meteor that is burning up as it plunges through the earth's atmosphere.</p></div></div>`;
