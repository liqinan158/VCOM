Little kids waiting for Santa Claus might wake up abruptly, thinking they've heard his sleigh bells <i>jangle</i> on the roof.</p><p class="long">A jangle is similar to a <i>jingle</i>, a ringing, bell-like noise, but it's typically a bit harsher or more discordant. You might contrast the delicate jingle of silver bracelets with the jangle of an enormous ring of keys. The word can also be used figuratively: something that makes you feel uneasy or upset jangles your nerves. An earlier definition of <i>jangle</i> was "talk excessively, chatter" or "slanderous conversation, gossip." The "harsh sound" meaning first arose in the 15th century.</p></div></div>`;
