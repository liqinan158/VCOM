The principal sees a food fight as a <i>wanton</i> act of vandalism done with <i>wanton</i> disregard for the rules, but the kids might just see it as fun.</p><p class="long"><i>Wanton</i> comes from the Old English <i>wan-</i> "lacking" and <i>togen</i> "to train, discipline," in other words, "lacking in discipline." Wanton extravagance is excessive and uncontrolled, whereas a wanton act of terrorism is random and intentionally cruel. Sometimes in older novels, you will see <i>wanton</i> used as a disapproving term to describe someone viewed as promiscuous, a usage that is considered old-fashioned today.</p></div>`;
