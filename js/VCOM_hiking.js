Put on some sturdy shoes and bring along your water bottle â€” let's go <i>hiking</i>!</p><p class="long">We usually reserve the term <i>hiking</i> for walks in the countryside. When you're striding down city sidewalks, you're walking, but when you're exploring trails in a state park, you're hiking. <i>Hiking</i> comes from the verb <i>hike</i>, originally spelled <i>hyke</i>, from English dialect.</p></div>`;
