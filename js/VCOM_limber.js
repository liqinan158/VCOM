Get into crazy yoga positions, or touch your toes? Then you're <i>limber,</i> meaning your body is pretty flexible and able to bend well.</p><p class="long"><i>Limber</i> generally implies long and graceful limbs. Ballet dancers, it goes without saying, are limber. The term is also used for anything that's capable of being bent easily, such as a piece of metal or, in the metaphorical sense, someone's personality. More often, though, with this particular sense you'll find the word <i>pliant</i> used, implying easily manipulated. Good to be limber, less so to be pliant.</p></div></div>`;
