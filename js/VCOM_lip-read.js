Hearing impaired people who learn to <i>lip read</i> can understand even people who don't know sign language.</p><p class="long">While being fluent in sign language makes it possible for deaf people to communicate easily with each other, and with those who also understand it, an ability to lip-read is also useful. Learning to lip-read is challenging for someone who's grown up deaf â€” it's easier for people with minimal, or gradual, hearing loss. You can also use the verb <i>speech-read</i>.</p></div>`;
