Your dog might bark <i>unceasingly</i> every time you leave the house, keeping it up until you come home again.</p><p class="long">The adverb <i>unceasingly</i> literally means "without ceasing," or "without stopping." To do something unceasingly also implies that you're pretty determined and focused as well. You might, for example, devote your life to working unceasingly to end child poverty and hunger. Both <i>unceasingly</i> and <i>cease</i>, or "stop," have a Latin root word, <i>cessare</i>, "go slow, be idle, leave off, or give over."</p></div></div>`;
