A dog that's growling ferociously and baring its teeth is sending a <i>univocal</i> message to keep your distance.</p><p class="long">You might also call univocal things "unambiguous." There's no way to misunderstand something that's truly univocal â€” its meaning is consistent and obvious. Your mom's univocal instruction to be home by 9:00 PM leaves no room for doubt: she means 9:00, not 9:30 or 10:15. This adjective is most often used in linguistics to talk about words, and its Latin roots are <i>uni-</i>, "having only one," and <i>vox</i>, "voice."</p></div>`;
