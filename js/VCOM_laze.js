On a hot summer weekend morning, you might want to <i>laze</i> on the beach or in a hammock with a book.</p><p class="long">When you laze, you lounge around, not working or really doing much of anything: you're being luxuriously lazy. If your friend asks what you plan to do during a school holiday, you might reply, "I'm just going to <i>laze</i> around all week." <i>Laze</i> came from <i>lazy</i>, originally <i>laysy</i>, and meaning "averse to work." Its origin is a mystery, though some experts think it's related to <i>lay</i>.</p></div></div>`;
