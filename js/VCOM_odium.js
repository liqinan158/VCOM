var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">odium</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">That shivery feeling of disgust and hatred that you get when you see something senseless and horrible is called <i>odium</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Odium</i> made its way into the English language through Latin, and the word’s root <i>od-</i>, meaning “hatred,” might tip you off that this word involves extreme dislike of some sort. Odium is a little more immediate than hate and usually describes a negative response to a specific action rather than a long-held, sustained hatred. Your dislike of broccoli, for example, wouldn’t be described as <i>odium</i>. Instead, think of <i>odium</i> as hate mixed with repulsion and condemnation, what you feel, for example, if you hear a racist speech or a news story about a terrorist act.</p></div>`;
