var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">uncool</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Uncool</i> means unstylish or not in fashion, like your dad's <i>uncool</i> jeans or the <i>uncool</i> music he likes to blast in the car when he picks you up from school. (How embarrassing!)</p><p class="long">The colloquial word <i>cool</i>, meaning "fashionable," or denoting approval in general, has been around since the 1930s and 40s, inspired by jazz slang. <i>Uncool</i>, meaning the exact opposite, first appeared in the 1950s as hipster slang, and it's been in use ever since. So if you're disapproving of or unimpressed with something, it's totally cool to go ahead and call it uncool.</p></div>`;
