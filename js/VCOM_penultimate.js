If you’re watching the <i>penultimate</i> episode of your favorite TV show, you know that there’s only one more episode to go.</p><p class="long"><i>Penultimate</i> came into English in the 17th century from the Latin word <i>paenultimus</i>, a combination of <i>paene</i>, meaning “almost,” and <i>ultimus</i>, meaning “last.” So if something’s penultimate, it’s “almost last”: more specifically, it’s next to last. If you’re reading a book with 20 chapters, chapter 19 is the penultimate chapter. If you’re a fan of grammar terms, you might already know that <i>penultimate</i> can refer to a word’s next to last syllable, called a penult.</p></div>`;
