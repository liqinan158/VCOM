In the summer, you're most likely to see <i>cuckoos</i> in various parts of Europe.</p><p class="long">The famous German cuckoo clock is named for the cuckoo bird, and the <i>cuckoo</i> sound the clock makes each hour imitates the call of the cuckoo. To make this call is also to <i>cuckoo</i>. Informally, you might refer to eccentric or crazy people or situations as <i>cuckoo</i>.
