Go to many art museums and you'll see paintings of <i>fauns</i> cavorting through the forest or playing a flute.</p><p class="long">The faun first appeared in Roman mythology, and it's turned up in many art forms since then. There are paintings and sculptures of fauns from the 1800s, and a ten-minute symphonic piece by Claude Debussy, called "The Afternoon of a <i>Faun</i>" in English. Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote a book called "The Marble <i>Faun</i>," and the Chronicles of Narnia's character Mr. Tumnus is a faun. The word comes from the Latin <i>Faunus</i>, a god of the countryside.</p></div>`;
