You may sometimes catch your kids making <i>derisive</i> comments â€” especially if you ask them to do chores instead of whatever they think is more important.</p><p class="long"><i>Derisive</i> comes from the Latin word <i>deridere</i>, meaning "to ridicule," and is from the roots <i>de-</i>, which means "down," and <i>ridere</i>, which means "to laugh." The adjective <i>derisory</i> comes from the same Latin word, but it has a different sense. If you say something derisive, you show contempt or ridicule, as in a derisive glare at your noisy neighbors. If you say something is derisory, you mean it invites or deserves ridicule or contempt, especially if it is laughably small, such as a derisory diamond chip in an engagement ring.</p></div></div>`;
