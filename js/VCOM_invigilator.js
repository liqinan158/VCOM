Aspiring law school students who take the LSAT usually have a professional invigilator whose job it is to monitor the testing room and keep an eye on the clock. When you take a math test, your teacher likely plays the role of invigilator, gathering any stray smartphones and patrolling the rows of desks if she hears any whispering. The Latin root <i>invigilare</i> means "watch over."</p></div>`;
