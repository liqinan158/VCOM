It’s a <i>misnomer</i> to call your grandmother “Grandfather,” the same way it’s a <i>misnomer</i> to call a chair with four legs that doesn’t move unless you drag it across the floor, a rocking chair.</p><p class="long">From the Middle-French <i>misnomer</i> “to misname” evolved our English <i>misnomer</i>, a noun indicating a lack of fit when it comes to naming. Synonyms include, predictably, <i>misnamed</i>, but also <i>mistermed</i> and <i>miscalled</i>. You’ll notice the repetition of the <i>mis-</i> at the front of all those words. It comes from the French <i>mes-</i>, which means “wrongly.”</p></div>`;
