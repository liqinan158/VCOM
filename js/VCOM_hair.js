Even people with no hair on their heads have body hair, short, fine hairs that grow on arms and legs. Cats have coats that vary too, ranging from hairless to long, silky hair. Even some plants can be described as having hair. Colloquially, people "split <i>hairs</i>," or argue about unimportant things, or tell a "<i>hair</i>-raising" tale, or a spooky story that gives you chills.</p></div>`;
