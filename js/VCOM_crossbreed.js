To <i>crossbreed</i> is to produce a creature of this type. If you <i>crossbreed</i> a lion and a tiger, you make a liger.</p><p class="long">Geneticists, who study DNA, make crossbreeds when they mix parents with different genes to create a new type of offspring. Often such crossbreeds are new kinds of plants. Different animals can be mixed to create crossbreeds, too. A common example of a crossbreed is with dog breeds, like when a poodle and a schnauzer are bred to create a schnoodle.</p></div></div>`;
