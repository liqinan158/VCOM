You might think rap music has no historical <i>antecedent</i>, but earlier forms of African-American spoken verse go back for centuries.</p><p class="long">In logic, mathematics, and grammar, the word <i>antecedent</i> (from Latin <i>ante-</i>, "before" + <i>cedere</i>, "to yield") has the meaning "the first part of a statement." More generally, it means "something that came before, and perhaps caused, something else." The word is also an adjective: a lawyer or judge might talk about the "<i>antecedent</i> events" leading up to someone committing a crime.</p></div>`;
