Far from the city lights, it gets so <i>dark</i> at night that you can see many stars in the sky.</p><p class="long"><i>Dark</i> comes from the Proto-Germanic word <i>derkaz</i>, which means "to hide or conceal." This meaning is preserved in the phrase <i>kept in the dark,</i> meaning purposely keeping information from someone. As an adjective, in addition to being the opposite of <i>light</i>, <i>dark</i> describes things that are gloomy, difficult to interpret or heavy, like a dark movie whose main character feels alienated from society.</p></div>`;
