Most <i>chalets</i> are made of wood and have a very wide, heavy roof that slopes down.</p><p class="long">You might think of a chalet as a house you stay in during a ski vacation. Although chalets were originally the modest huts or cottages that Alpine herders lived in, over time the area became popular with skiers and vacationers, and <i>chalet</i> came to mean "mountainside holiday home." In Swiss-French, <i>chalet</i> means "herdsman's hut" or "Alpine cottage," from the Old French word <i>chasel</i>, "farmhouse."</p></div></div>`;
