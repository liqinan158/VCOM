Along with copper, it's used to make the brass for light fixtures, doorknobs, and tools, among many other things. Pennies contain zinc too â€” since 1982, they contain 97.5% zinc and 2.5% copper. There's also zinc in our bodies, and in food including shellfish, meat, and seeds. The word <i>zinc</i> is believed to come from the German <i>Zinke</i>, "point," in reference to the spiked shape of a zinc crystal.</p></div></div>`;
