At five syllables, the word <i>in-dis-sol-u-ble</i> itself even lasts a long time in your mouth.</p><p class="long">With roots dating back to the 15th century, <i>indissoluble</i> is a pretty tough adjective — it has survived hundreds of years. You can put a brownie in water and it will dissolve in no time, but a hockey puck in the same water is <i>indissoluble,</i> it won’t dissolve. An expression for indissoluble relationships might be "nothing can tear us apart," because there is so much strength in the bond. A strong law or legal contract also is indissoluble, though the paper it's written on is not.</p></div></div>`;
