Over time it came to mean mainly serving girls, as in a bar wench, who serves drinks at a tavern. Eventually it came to mean prostitute. If you find <i>wench</i> in a love poem from the 16th century, think of it as an informal version of <i>maiden</i>. But if someone called you a wench last week, you should be insulted.</p></div>`;
