This can apply to a dose of medicine, an order, a survey, or a punishment. <i>Administer</i> can also mean to run something â€” such as a school or an office.</p><p class="long">The word <i>administer</i> belongs to a family of words, all having to do with being in charge: <i>administration</i>, <i>administrator</i>, and <i>administrative</i>. Strangely, <i>administer</i> comes from the Latin word <i>minister</i> meaning "servant." So, if your boss or principal administers an instruction that you disagree with, just think of that person as your servant. Doing so will help you carry out your duties with a smile.</p></div></div>`;
