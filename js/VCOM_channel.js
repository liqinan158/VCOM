The noun <i>channel</i> can be used for many such avenues. It can mean a waterway such as the English Channel — the "Chunnel" is a tunnel beneath the Channel — or a means of accomplishing a goal, as in "going through legal <i>channels</i>." Use it as a verb when you channel your energies to achieve success.</p></div></div>`;
