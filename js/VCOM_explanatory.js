var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">explanatory</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the adjective <i>explanatory</i> when you're talking about a clarification or an explanation. An abstract artwork in a gallery that consists of an old sneaker might require an <i>explanatory</i> note, for example.</p><p class="long">The Latin word <i>explanare</i> is at the root of <i>explanatory</i>, and its literal meaning is "to make level or to flatten." When you give an explanatory answer or make an explanatory speech, you are laying it all out â€” providing all the details your listener needs to understand. Anything that makes something more clear can be described as explanatory, like a footnote in a term paper or your apologetic list of reasons for being late to your best friend's party.</p></div>`;
