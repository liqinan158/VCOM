In his most famous line, Hamlet was using the <i>infinitive</i> form of the verb "be." The <i>infinitive</i> form of a verb is its most basic form, usually its "to" version.</p><p class="long">The word <i>infinitive</i> comes from the Latin <i>infinitus</i> meaning "unbounded, unlimited." When a verb is in its infinite form, it's not limited or bound by its subject or tense. Contrast "to be" with "was" â€” <i>was</i> is tied to the past tense and a single person. Strip away the word <i>to</i> from "to be" and you have what's known as a bare infinitive. Keep the <i>to</i> there and you've got a full infinitive.</p></div></div>`;
