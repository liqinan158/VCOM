For safety, you should make your <i>fire</i> in a <i>fire</i> pit or fireplace, but for fun, you can toast marshmallows over the <i>fire</i>.</p><p class="long">As a verb, <i>fire</i> can mean to discharge a weapon. Your hometown might fire a cannon on the common each year to celebrate the Fourth of July. Rather than use a real cannonball, they probably fire it with blanks. The verb <i>fire</i> can also mean to terminate from a position of employment. It's no fun to have to fire someone, especially the guy you fire is your brother.</p></div></div>`;
