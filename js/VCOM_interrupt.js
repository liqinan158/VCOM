Then your brother interrupts your peace and quiet by shouting answers — wrong answers — at the TV. A special weather bulletin then interrupts your "regularly scheduled program" with a severe thunderstorm warning. And, to complete the job, lightning causes an <i>interrupt</i> (now used as a noun) in the power grid and your electricity goes off.</p></div></div>`;
