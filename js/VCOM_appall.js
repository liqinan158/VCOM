If a gory scene in a movie appalls you, you're likely to turn pale. The word <i>appall</i> always carries with it the feeling of disgust. You might be shocked by a loud noise, but in order for it to appall you, it would probably have to come along with a really foul smell or a gruesome scene.</p></div></div>`;
