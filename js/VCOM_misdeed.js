It’s one that's wicked, unethical, illegal, or just plain wrong. It’s the opposite of a good deed. Cheating on a test is a misdeed. So is cheating on your spouse. Stealing is a misdeed, as is any other crime. Politicians get caught in scandals when their misdeeds are discovered, such as lying or taking bribes. It’s from the Old English <i>misdæd</i> for  "sin, evil.”</p></div>`;
