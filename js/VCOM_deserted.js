It's fun to spend an afternoon taking pictures of a <i>deserted</i> house with its overgrown yard and mysterious relics, but come nightfall it might feel a little spooky.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>deserted</i> often describes an empty building that’s been abandoned by its owners, but you can use it for anything that’s remote or without any people around. You might get the chills when you walk down a deserted street at night. <i>Deserted</i> can also describe something that’s much less crowded than normal. On Super Bowl Sunday, the shopping mall might be deserted — everyone is home, watching the game.</p></div>`;
