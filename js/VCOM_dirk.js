A <i>dirk</i> is known as a thrusting or stabbing dagger.</p><p class="long">Though it's not common to hear the word <i>dirk</i> these days, the weapon was frequently carried by naval officers during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As recently as World War Two, members of the Japanese navy used dirks in hand-to-hand combat. The word is associated with Scotland, although its precise origin is a little murky â€” it was originally spelled <i>dork</i> or <i>durk</i>, possibly from the Dutch <i>dolk</i> by way of the German <i>dolch</i>, or "dagger."</p></div>`;
