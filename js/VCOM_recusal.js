A <i>recusal</i>, for example, would replace a judge if the defendant in a case was a relative.</p><p class="long">An attorney might ask for recusal if she overhears the judge saying something like, "Well it's obvious he's guilty â€” just look at those clothes he's wearing!" Before a case is decided, both judge and jury have to be completely unbiased and impartial for the result to be just. Recusal protects against a judge's bias. The word comes from <i>recuse</i>, "reject or challenge as disqualified to act."</p></div>`;
