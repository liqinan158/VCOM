A famous example is John Keats' "<i>Ode</i> on a Grecian Urn." Apparently, Keats was really into urns.</p><p class="long">An ode is a form of lyric poetry — expressing emotion — and it's usually addressed to someone or something, or it represents the poet's musings on that person or thing, as Keats' ode tells us what he thought as he looked at the Grecian urn. The word <i>ode</i> comes from a Greek word for "song," and like a song, an ode is made up of verses and can have a complex meter.</p></div></div>`;
