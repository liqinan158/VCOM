Be careful, though, because you might inspire someone to take <i>vengeance</i> on you in return.</p><p class="long">Vengeance is a downward spiral of pain and betrayal, one person hurting another, who hurts another, and so on. You might demand vengeance if your brother throws your favorite jeans into a tree, and your brother might feel the same way after you spit gum in his hair. The phrase “with a <i>vengeance</i>” means to do something with a lot of intensity. <i>Vengeance</i> shares roots with the word <i>revenge</i>, and someone who wants revenge usually pursues it with a vengeance.</p></div></div>`;
