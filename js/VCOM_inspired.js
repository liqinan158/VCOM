If your singing in a choral concert is particularly <i>inspired,</i> people can hear your voice hitting all the right notes beautifully.</p><p class="long">If something is so extraordinary that it's worthy of being described as <i>inspired,</i> you might think that the gods had something to do with its creation. In fact, <i>inspired</i> originally meant "directly inspired by God or gods." It comes from the Latin <i>in</i>-"in" and spirare "to breathe." Maybe such supernatural power did breathe life into something truly excellent. Or maybe the humans just worked very hard and had a great idea.</p></div></div>`;
