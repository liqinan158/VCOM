If this word doesn't give you flashbacks to high school chemistry class, then we don't know what will.</p><p class="long">About 200 years ago, German chemist Robert Bunsen was born â€” no doubt unaware that his surname would eventually become inseparable from a common piece of laboratory equipment that he would later invent: the bunsen burner. Its great advantage over earlier burners was the air valve that allows variable amounts of air to be mixed with the fuel. If you've ever taken a chemistry class or worked in a laboratory, you probably used a bunsen burner to create a chemical reaction.</p></div></div>`;
