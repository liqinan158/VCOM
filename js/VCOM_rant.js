When the shouting starts on talk radio, or when a blog commenter resorts to ALL CAPS, you're almost certainly encountering a <i>rant</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Rant</i> comes from the Dutch <i>ranten</i>, "to talk nonsense." <i>Rave</i> is a close synonym â€” in fact, "to <i>rant</i> and rave" is a popular expression. When <i>rant</i> is used as a noun, it means something like <i>tirade</i>. The first recorded usage of <i>rant</i> is from the end of the sixteenth century, in Shakespeare's <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i>. By the middle of the turbulent seventeenth century, the name <i>Ranters</i> was used as a catchall pejorative for various groups of radical Christian dissenters.</p></div></div>`;
