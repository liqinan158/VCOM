An <i>explosion</i> involves a sudden and often violent burst of energy.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>explosion</i> is useful when you're talking about a watermelon smashing on the pavement or the burst of fireworks overhead, but it can also describe a sudden increase in something, like an explosion of excitement at a birthday party when the pony arrives. Originally, <i>explosion</i> was used to mean "scornful rejection," from its root in the Latin <i>explodere</i>, "hiss off the stage," and a disappointed audience today might still be described as "<i>exploding</i> with boos."</p></div></div>`;
