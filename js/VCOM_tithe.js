Devout church-goers usually <i>tithe</i>, even in years when their finances are very tight.</p><p class="long"><i>Tithe</i> comes from the Old English word <i>teogotha</i>, which means “tenth.” To tithe is to relinquish one-tenth of your personal income, either as a mandatory contribution, a voluntary donation, or as a levy. In ancient times farmers were required to tithe a portion of their crops. You may suspect that some of the wealthiest members of your church don’t really tithe as expected.</p></div>`;
