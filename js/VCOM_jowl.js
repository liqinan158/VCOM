The <i>jowl</i> is also the lower jaw, which is hinged so the mouth can open, in vertebrates.</p><p class="long">The two meanings of <i>jowl</i> both relate to the jaw. In some cases, jowl literally means jaw, as in the hinged lower jaw of vertebrates. Without a jowl, you wouldn't be able to open your mouth. The jowl can also be called the jawbone, lower jawbone, mandible, or submaxilla. The other kind of jowl — usually called jowls — are loose, fleshy areas around the jaw and lower cheeks. Older people are more likely to have jowls, especially if they are overweight.</p></div></div>`;
