Planes flying in <i>formation</i> make a deliberate, specific pattern in the sky.</p><p class="long">Some formations are on purpose, or deliberate — like military troops marching in formation or a cheerleading squad arranging itself in formation. Others just arrange themselves in a particular way by chance, like a striking cloud formation overhead. You can also talk about the formation — or establishment — of something less physical, like the formation of a new government. The Latin root, <i>formationem</i>, means "a shaping."</p></div></div>`;
