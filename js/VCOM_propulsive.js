var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">propulsive</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The adjective <i>propulsive</i> describes something that has the power to drive something forward. You would not want a <i>propulsive</i> jet engine on your model airplane — it’s just too much power for something that should stay in the basement.</p><p class="long">You can think of <i>propulsive</i> as describing an object that has propellers (like a helicopter) that move it forward. But the word <i>propulsive</i> is not just for the literal. Use <i>propulsive</i> to make a description more colorful and imaginative. The word suggests a feeling of propelling, like hearing a soaring melody with a propulsive rhythm or a propulsive speech that makes you want to change the world.</p></div>`;
