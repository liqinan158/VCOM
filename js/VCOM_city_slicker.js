"You city slickers should've brought some mud boots," your country-dwelling uncle might say, looking at your bright white sneakers. <i>City slicker</i> first appeared around 1916, and a short 1918 film called "The City Slicker" tells the story of a fancy urbanite who shows up in a dusty rural town.</p></div>`;
