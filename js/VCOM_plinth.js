The <i>plinth</i> typically lies between the column and the ground.</p><p class="long">In architecture, a plinth is one of the basic building elements. While it's most common for a plinth to support a pillar or column, it can also be used as a base or slab underneath a statue, a bust, or a decorative vase, and in engineering a <i>plinth</i> is the support for a dam. The word comes from the Greek root <i>plinthos</i>, "brick" or "squared stone."</p></div></div>`;
