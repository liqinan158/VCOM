If you're lucky, you might read some juicy <i>tabloid</i> headlines when you pass the corner newsstand.</p><p class="long">A tabloid is more likely to print celebrity gossip or crime stories with large photographs than news about international issues or the economy, especially on the front page. Tabloids aren't taken entirely seriously as journalism, although they are very popular and tend to sell well. The word <i>tabloid</i> originally meant "small tablet of medicine" in the 1880's. By 1900, it also meant "a compressed form of anything," including journalism.</p></div>`;
