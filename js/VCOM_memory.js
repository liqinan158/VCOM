Your brain's <i>memory</i> helps you recall lots of memories â€” like multiplication tables and bad dates.</p><p class="long">The word <i>memory</i> applies to both the individual facts and experiences you remember as well as the brain's ability to contain it all.  A good <i>memory</i> for names means you retain someone's name. But a good <i>memory</i> of your summer job means that you had fun while working at the Jiffy Lube. <i>Memory</i> has also come to refer to a computer's capacity to store information.  As far as we know, however, computers do not have fond <i>memories</i> of their past programs.</p></div></div>`;
