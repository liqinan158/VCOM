var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">tatterdemalion</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the word <i>tatterdemalion</i> for anyone who's dressed in messy, ragged clothes. You may want to call your brother a <i>tatterdemalion</i> if he shows up for Thanksgiving dinner wearing a dirty sweatshirt and his favorite ripped jeans.</p><p class="long">A slightly more common word for a tatterdemalion is a <i>ragamuffin</i>. As an adjective, <i>tatterdemalion</i> means "unkempt" or "shoddy," so go ahead and ask your brother, "Why are you wearing that tatterdemalion outfit?" While the <i>tatter</i> part of the word is fairly clear (a tatterdemalion's clothing is in tatters), the ending is a mystery. There may be a connection to the French<i>de maillot</i>, or "shirt."</p></div>`;
