Even the bravest swimmers will head for the <i>shore</i> when they hear someone yell "Shark!"</p><p class="long">The verb <i>shore</i> means "prop up or support," so you might shore up a house that's tilting on its foundation or shore up a failing company with an investment of money.  The water's-edge <i>shore</i> has a Germanic root that means "cut," and experts believe that the noun <i>shore</i> grew either from a sense of "division between land and water," or possibly "land cut off from the mainland by marshes."</p></div>`;
