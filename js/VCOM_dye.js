You can use hair <i>dye</i> to change your light brown hair to deep, dark purple.</p><p class="long">Dye is used on fabrics, hair, yarn and other fibers, clothing, and food, among other things. When you apply dye to something, you <i>dye</i> it. If you're baking a birthday cake for your friend who loves the color orange, you might use food coloring — a type of dye — to dye the vanilla frosting orange. The Old English root of <i>dye</i> is <i>deah</i>, "a color or hue," which is possibly related to <i>deagol</i>, "secret, hidden, or dark."</p></div>`;
