Your <i>perverse</i> sense of humor probably makes some of your friends laugh while others just look uncomfortable.</p><p class="long">Something perverse is unusual, possibly somewhat weird, and even immoral, like that time the odd kid in class announced that a love poem was really all about lovingly poisoning squirrels and no one sat next to him for a week afterwards. That kid's perspective was perverse. <i>Perverse</i> can also mean "stubbornly contradictory" or "perverted." The word originally meant "wicked," from the Latin <i>perversus</i>, "turned away or askew," and figuratively, "turned away from what is right."</p></div></div>`;
