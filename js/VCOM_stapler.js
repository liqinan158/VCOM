If you don't have a paper clip, you'll need a <i>stapler</i> for your book report.</p><p class="long">A stapler works by pushing the sharp metal ends of a staple through the paper and folding the staple's ends so the sheets are securely fastened together. Eighteenth-century French toolmakers created the first stapler for King Louis XV, with every single staple inscribed with the royal court insignia. Earlier, sealing wax acted as a less-effective kind of fastener. In 2012, $80 million was spent on staplers.</p></div>`;
