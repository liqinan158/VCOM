When you have plenty of cookies and cake, you can say your table is replete with goodies. Another cousin of <i>replete</i> is <i>replenish</i>. When your cabinets are bare, you go to the store to replenish them. When you unpack your groceries, your pantry is replete with essentials.</p></div></div>`;
