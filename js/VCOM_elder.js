A church <i>elder</i> is someone who helps run the church, not necessarily its eldest member.</p><p class="long"><i>Elder</i> can be used as an adjective: Abel was the elder brother of Cain. <i>Elder</i> can also be a noun: showing respect for one’s elders is a value instilled from a young age by our parents. Elder is also a kind of tree. In Act Five of “Love’s Labour Lost” Shakespeare plays with the meanings of <i>elder</i>: Holofernes says that Berowne should speak first because he is the elder (older), which inspires Berowne to mention the folklore that Judas was hanged on an elder tree.</p></div>`;
