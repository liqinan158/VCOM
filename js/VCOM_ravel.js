Confusingly, <i>ravel</i> can mean both "tangle" and "untangle." It's perfectly understandable to tangle up the meanings of <i>ravel</i>!</p><p class="long">If you work to <i>ravel</i> yarn into a neat ball, your cat may come along and try to <i>ravel</i> it again. How can a word mean both one thing and its opposite? In the case of <i>ravel</i>, the answer is sewing: As threads come unwoven from a cloth, they become tangled on each other. Since untangling is never far from tangling, <i>ravel</i> covers both meanings.</p></div>`;
