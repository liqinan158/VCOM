var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">low-resolution</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The adjective <i>low-resolution</i> describes a blurry or pixelated image, or the technology used to produce it. Your <i>low-resolution</i> printer is not the tool you need to print out a poster-sized photo of your cat.</p><p class="long">High-resolution digital cameras can produce a sharply defined, clear image, even when you zoom in on it to make a small detail much larger. By contrast, a low-resolution camera can't achieve that much detail without losing those sharp edges. A low-resolution (or "low-res") photograph quickly becomes blurred and imprecise. This word arose from computer lingo, though the "effect of an optical instrument" meaning of <i>resolution</i> dates from the 19th century.</p></div>`;
