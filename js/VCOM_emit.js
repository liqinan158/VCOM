All of which could be potentially embarrassing, depending on where they're coming from.</p><p class="long">Lots of things can be emitted: body heat from your hands, high-pitched sound waves from a dog whistle, nasty odors from your mouth after a garlic-heavy lunch. Coming from the Latin <i>emitter</i>, it simply means to “send forth.” Since climate change is such a hot topic, you've probably heard people talking about how much CO₂ cars emit or how many greenhouse gases factories emit into the air.</p></div></div>`;
