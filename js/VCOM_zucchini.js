In England, it's more common to call <i>zucchinis</i> "courgettes."</p><p class="long">Officially, zucchini (like all squash) is considered a fruit, a large berry that grows as part of a flower. However, cooks generally treat it as a vegetable, preparing it in savory recipes ranging from baked zucchini with cheese and tomato sauce to pasta-like zucchini "noodles" to sauteed zucchini with butter and garlic. You can also shred zucchini and bake it into sweet breads and cakes. The word comes from the Italian <i>zucca</i>, "gourd or squash."</p></div>`;
