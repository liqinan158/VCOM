You could have a secret passion for Japanese anime comics and share that secret with only your closest friends. If you're "in on a <i>secret</i>" — plans for a surprise birthday party, for instance — that means you're in the inner circle of people in the know. Everybody has to keep the secret, or the party won't be a surprise.</p></div></div>`;
