If a bird is high in the air, then moves down quickly, making an arc or loop, that's an example of a swoop. People can also swoop â€” three muggers might swoop in on a victim, for example. The phrase "one fell <i>swoop</i>" means "all at once," and Shakespeare used it first, in "Macbeth:" "What, All my pretty Chickens, and their Dam, At one fell <i>swoop</i>?"</p></div></div>`;
