Instead of describing yourself as a terrible speller, you might instead proudly refer to your spelling as <i>unorthodox</i>.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>unorthodox</i> originally referred to religion, specifically to a person or practice that went against the traditions of a particular belief. The Greek roots of <i>unorthodox</i> are <i>orthos</i>, or "right," and <i>doxa</i>, or "opinion." So someone whose beliefs are orthodox has "the right opinion," while an unorthodox person does not. The definition has evolved so that <i>unorthodox</i>'s meaning is closer to "unusual" or "innovative" than just plain "wrong."</p></div>`;
