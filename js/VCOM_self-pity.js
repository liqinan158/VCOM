var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">self-pity</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If you're completely focused on feeling bad about your own problems and complaints, you're feeling <i>self-pity</i>. Your <i>self-pity</i> can make it hard to appreciate that other people face more serious troubles than you do.</p><p class="long">When you feel sorry for yourself, or overly sad about the difficulties you face, you're indulging in self-pity. It's often easier to identify self-pity in other people than in yourself, partly because your own self-pity keeps your attention focused inward. Before the 17th century, <i>pity</i> and <i>piety</i> meant the same thing, "compassion, care, or tenderness." Today <i>piety</i> means "religious reverence."</p></div>`;
