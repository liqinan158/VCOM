It refers to the attraction to iron and other metals in electric currents and magnets, or to the other kind of attraction — where people want to be close to each other.</p><p class="long">Different kinds of magnetism cause some magnets to attract, while others repel. Magnetism can also be called a magnetic force or magnetic attraction. Chemistry and earth science are two classes you might learn about magnetism in. Outside of the classroom, magnetism can be the force of attraction between people — if you have animal magnetism, don’t worry, a giraffe isn’t going to stick to you, but watch out for people with lovey eyes.</p></div>`;
