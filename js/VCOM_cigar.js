A <i>cigar</i> is usually brown, and it's almost always fatter and longer than a cigarette.</p><p class="long">Cigar smoking tends to be more of a special event than cigarette smoking, and the ritual involves cutting off the cigar's closed end, lighting the other side with a match, and puffing the smoke lightly. Another difference between cigar and cigarette smokers is that cigar smoke isn't usually inhaled, but only drawn into the mouth. The word <i>cigar</i> comes from the Spanish <i>cigarro</i>, most likely from a Mayan root, <i>sicar</i>, "to smoke rolled tobacco leaves."</p></div>`;
