And something that's composed is made up of parts. So to decompose is to undo all the parts until they go back to their original state: dirt. Living things decompose. When things like buildings or organizations break down, you typically use words like <i>dismantle</i> or <i>deconstruct</i> to describe the process.</p></div>`;
