It would be <i>coldhearted</i> to stand there, not caring, when you see a little kid fall and hurt herself.</p><p class="long">Most people are sympathetic and warm, but those who don't have much feeling for others are <i>coldhearted</i>. It's coldhearted to blithely hurt someone, and it's coldhearted for a wealthy person to spend money on himself without even thinking about how he can help his needy neighbors. Some days, the world can feel a bit coldhearted. The word first appeared in Shakespeare's play "Antony and Cleopatra," when Antony asks the coldhearted Cleopatra, "<i>Cold-hearted</i> toward me?"</p></div></div>`;
