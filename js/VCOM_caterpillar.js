Many <i>caterpillars</i> are striped and colorful.</p><p class="long">A caterpillar is officially the larva, or immature form, of a flying insect â€” generally, a butterfly. Because caterpillars are growing rapidly, they tend to eat constantly, and for this reason they're considered pests by gardeners and farmers. The word <i>caterpillar</i> comes from the Old North French <i>caterpilose</i>, literally "shaggy cat," from the Late Latin <i>catta</i>, "cat," and <i>pilosus</i>, "hairy" or "shaggy."</p></div>`;
