With a few exceptions (think French fries), <i>vegetables</i> are just about the healthiest food you can eat.</p><p class="long">Culinary purists will tell you that some things you think of as vegetables, like tomatoes and zucchinis, aren't vegetables at all â€” they're fruits, because they have seeds. In general, though, it's fine to refer to the parts of plants used for food as <i>vegetables</i>. The word's original meaning was simply "any plant," and soon it came to mean "plant cultivated for food." Since 1921, it's also been slang for "person leading a monotonous, inactive life."</p></div>`;
