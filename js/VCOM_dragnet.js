A <i>dragnet</i> is a coordinated attempt to catch a criminal.</p><p class="long"><i>Dragnet</i> originally referred to a kind of net for catching fish. It can now also indicate a less literal type of net: one that catches crooks. Police may use a dragnet if they know a wanted criminal is in a certain neighborhood. When cops set up a dragnet, they may call in extra officers, fence off areas from civilians, and arm themselves heavily. This word became famous because of the TV show <i>Dragnet</i>, which featured Sergeant Joe Friday.</p></div>`;
