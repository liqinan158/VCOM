There is some evidence that members of the Moche civilization, in what is now Peru, believed that sex with dead bodies provided a spiritual connection with the deceased, but necrophilia has mostly been a rare and abnormal occurrence. The word comes from the Greek <i>nekros</i>, "death," and <i>philia</i>, "love or affection."</p></div></div>`;
