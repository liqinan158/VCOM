If you run around the mall naked, you’ll get in trouble for <i>indecent</i> exposure!</p><p class="long"><i>Indecent</i> describes things that are not decent — the prefix <i>-in</i> often means “not,” like how <i>in</i>dependent means “not dependent.” Decent things are morally sound, so indecent things are offensive. Swearing is considered indecent. Indecent often means rude. A joke might go over well with your friends but is considered indecent when told to a teacher. Not everyone will agree on what’s indecent, but we all agree that you should keep your clothes on at the mall.</p></div>`;
