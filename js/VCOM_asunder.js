It is a somewhat archaic and uncommon word and many people know it only from religious marriage ceremonies: "What God has joined together let no man put asunder." In most cases, you can use its more common synonym "apart" and convey the same meaning, unless you want to express a particularly violent or forceful ripping.</p></div>`;
