You might see a <i>raccoon</i> trying to get into your trash at night, looking for a midnight snack.</p><p class="long">Raccoons live in North and Central America, and they're commonly found in urban areas. They're known for their rascally nocturnal nature, since they can use their paws to open trashcan lids and often nest in people's attics. Raccoons can also carry rabies, and they hiss loudly when threatened. More charmingly, they also use their hands for washing and holding food â€” the Algonquian root of <i>raccoon</i>, <i>arahkunem</i>, means "he scratches with his hands."</p></div></div>`;
