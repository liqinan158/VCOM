Often one that's a bit puffy and overblown, making you think the speaker really likes the sound of his own voice.</p><p class="long"><i>Oratory</i> is from the Latin word <i>oratorius</i> for "speaking or pleading." In fact, oratories often leave audiences pleading for an end to the speech. They're the kind of thing evangelical preachers are good at. An <i>oratory</i> is also a little chapel, from the Latin <i>oratorium</i> for "a place of prayer," or a specific group of Roman Catholics, who name their oratories after where they're built, like the Brooklyn Oratory.</p></div>`;
