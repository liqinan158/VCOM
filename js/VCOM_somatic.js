You may be tired of hearing your great-grandfather's <i>somatic</i> complaints, but give him a break - his body has been working for 80 years!</p><p class="long"><i>Soma</i> means body in Latin, so <i>somatic</i> means of the body and is most often used in connection with one's health. You may be more familiar with the related word, psychosomatic, which describes a physical condition or illness caused by the mind rather than a virus or a sprain. If you don't want to go to school so much that you begin to feel sick, that is psychosomatic. But sometimes, your somatic symptoms mean you really do have a cold!</p></div></div>`;
