While your parents might want you to pursue a <i>lucrative</i> career, you're committed to your plan of becoming a professional mime.</p><p class="long">This adjective is from the Latin word <i>lucrum</i>, meaning "profit." In Latin, <i>lucrum</i> also meant "greed," a negative sense preserved in the English phrase <i>filthy lucre</i>, or "shameful profit or gain." But the word <i>lucrative</i> doesn't carry a similar sense of shame â€” if your lawn-mowing job proves lucrative over the summer, you might be able to buy yourself a used car.</p></div>`;
