It comes in a tube and is used commonly by plumbers and carpenters trying to seal up cracks where air or water might push through. When a plumber <i>caulks</i> a tub, he's applying <i>caulk</i> to its seams to make it watertight.</p><p class="long"><i>Caulk</i> can be used to describe both the process of applying caulk and the sealant itself. The word caulk comes from the Old Northern French <i>cauquer</i>, meaning "to press down." After you lay the caulk down over the seam you press it down by either running your finger over it or using a specific tool to force the caulk to settle into the hole you're trying to cover.</p></div>`;
