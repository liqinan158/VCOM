These hard-shelled nuts are similar to walnuts and used for sweet treats like praline candy and <i>pecan</i> pie.</p><p class="long"><i>Pecan</i> comes from an Algonquian word that means "nut that takes a stone to crack." It takes some work to break open a pecan, but it's well worth the effort. There are at least three "correct" ways to pronounce this word, so your best bet is to pick your favorite and stick with it. Pecan wood is used to make furniture and for smoking meats, and four U.S. states claim the pecan as their official state nut.</p></div></div>`;
