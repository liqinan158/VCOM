You can only be nonplussed. People are nonplussed when they’re astounded, exasperated, or at a loss. "I'm <i>nonplussed</i>," you say when your mother tells you she's marrying her 25-year-old personal trainer. "I'm <i>nonplussed</i>," you say when your boss fires you, even though he tells you you’re the best employee he's ever had. Since so many things are confusing and odd, there’s a lot in life that can leave you nonplussed.</p></div></div>`;
