You might march up to a bully, ready to give them a piece of your mind, only to end up saying something wishy-washy like, "Um, maybe you could be a little nicer?" Or you could find yourself being wishy-washy as you choose an ice cream flavor, wavering between vanilla and double-fudge mocha with marshmallows.</p></div>`;
