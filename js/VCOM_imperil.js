For example, an approaching storm with hurricane-force winds might <i>imperil</i> the geraniums you just planted in your front yard.</p><p class="long">A city's budget cuts might imperil a school's ability to hire new teachers and buy supplies. The lack of money, in other words, is a threat to schools. Likewise, a factory's refusal to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions will imperil the air quality nearby â€” and ultimately, imperil the health of the whole planet. The word <i>imperil</i> comes from <i>in</i> and <i>peril</i>, meaning "danger."</p></div></div>`;
