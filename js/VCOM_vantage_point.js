var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">vantage point</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>vantage point</i> is the particular perspective or position from which you can see something. The hike up may be difficult, but the mountain top is a great <i>vantage point</i> for viewing the fields of sunflowers below.</p><p class="long">A physical vantage point is the place you sit or stand that gives you a good view, like your favorite vantage point at a baseball game, directly behind home plate. A more figurative meaning of this term is something closer to "viewpoint," so you might say, "From my vantage point, our city should be spending more money fixing sidewalks than it does repairing potholes." The Old French source is <i>avantage</i>, "advantage or profit."</p></div>`;
