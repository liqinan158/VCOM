The figurative use of <i>etch</i> is just as common as its literal sense. A particularly powerful memory, image or emotion is said to "<i>etch</i> itself" into your mind, meaning, like that piece of graffiti you etched into the tree trunk, it won't be likely to be erased anytime soon. <i>Incise</i> and <i>carve</i> are often interchangeable with <i>etch</i>.</p></div>`;
