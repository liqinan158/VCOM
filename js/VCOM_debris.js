Although <i>debris</i> usually refers to the trash leftover after some kind of explosion or crash, it can also be what's on your floor after hosting a kid's make-your-own pizza party, or what you shouldn't leave at the park after a picnic. Sometimes Mother Nature leaves <i>debris</i>, such as a pile of rocks, or that car on your lawn after the flood recedes. Don't pronounce the "s": <i>debris</i> rhymes with "be free."</p></div></div>`;
