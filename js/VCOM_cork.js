It shows up in shoes, insulation, wall tiles, and badminton shuttlecocks, as well as bottle stoppers, which are also called <i>corks</i>. The word is from the Spanish <i>alcorque</i>, "cork-soled sandal," which ultimately comes from the Latin name for the cork oak tree, <i>quercus</i>.</p></div></div>`;
