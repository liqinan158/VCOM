If you want to be sure to get your picture in the <i>yearbook</i>, join a lot of clubs and teams.</p><p class="long">A traditional yearbook is a large, bound book organized by class, which includes a photograph of every student. Most yearbooks also feature pictures of teams, school groups and clubs, faculty members, staff, and candid photos taken throughout the school year. In many schools, it's traditional to get your yearbook signed by friends and even teachers. Yearbooks have become less common over the years, as digital equivalents have increased in popularity. Online yearbooks may eventually replace the printed version.</p></div></div>`;
