For cameras, it means finding a point where the subject is clear or "in <i>focus</i>." For students, it means paying attention.</p><p class="long"><i>Focus</i> is all about finding a center — of a parabolic curve, of a lens, of a meditative state. In Latin, <i>focus</i> meant 'domestic hearth,' which just goes to show that not much has changed — since kitchens remain the <i>focus</i> of the modern home. <i>Focus</i> can be used as a verb, as in "I need to focus on my work, so I can play video games later;" and as a noun, as in "What is the <i>focus</i> of this essay? I can't tell, since the writer seems to be all over the place."</p></div></div>`;
