You might also notice that you’ve seen the word before, either in late-night infomercials or in various advertisements in magazines, when they talk about <i>commemorative</i> plates, or stamps, or coins: little things that are supposed to honor events or people by recalling them to our collective memory.</p></div></div>`;
