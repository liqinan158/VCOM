A week of <i>nonstop</i> rain can cause flooding, and be pretty gloomy too.</p><p class="long">You can use the word <i>nonstop</i> as an adjective or adverb, and while it can literally mean "without stopping," it's also frequently used in an exaggerated way, to mean "a lot of the time." Your friend's description of a nonstop dance party or a nervous substitute teacher who giggles nonstop are examples of this. A nonstop plane flight, on the other hand, literally flies from one city to another without landing at another airport on the way.</p></div>`;
