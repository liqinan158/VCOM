Your <i>advocacy</i> for an animal rights group might help raise money to save stray pups.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>advocacy</i> comes to English from a term used in Roman law. An advocate was a professional whose job was to plead cases in front of a court of law. That meaning led to the verb form <i>advocate</i>, as well as <i>advocacy</i>, to describe the work of an advocate. "The lunchroom staff were <i>advocates</i> for healthier school lunches; their <i>advocacy</i> was supported by parents and the school board; however, the students were reluctant to give up their cookies and chips."</p></div>`;
