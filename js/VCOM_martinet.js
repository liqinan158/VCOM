Jean Martinet, the man for whom the word was coined, would insist you say his name correctly. He was a legendary drillmaster for the French army during the reign of Louis XIV. In 1779, a hundred years after Martinet's death, <i>martinet</i> came to mean any officer who was as strict and demanding in adhering to the rules as Martinet himself.</p></div>`;
