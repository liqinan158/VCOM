var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">tandem</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Tandem</i> describes an arrangement where people or animals are in formation, one behind the other. Couples attached at the hip sometimes like to ride <i>tandem</i> bicycles, which allow two people to pedal the same bike. How cute.</p><p class="long">In 1785, <i>tandem</i> first came into existence as a noun meaning “carriage pulled by horses harnessed one behind the other.” About a hundred years later, people started to use <i>tandem</i> to refer to bicycles with two seats. This type of bicycle has two sets of pedals and two seats, but only one set of wheels. To transform <i>tandem</i> into an adverb, just stick <i>in</i> in front of it. "In <i>tandem</i>" can just mean "together" — like two departments working in tandem on a project.</p></div>`;
