var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">rocky</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Anything <i>rocky</i> is covered with rocks, like a <i>rocky</i> beach or hillside. You can also use <i>rocky</i> for something that moves in a bumpy or uneven manner, like a <i>rocky</i> ride in a Jeep.</p><p class="long">There's a figurative sense of <i>rocky</i> that means "difficult, rough, or up-and-down" like your rocky relationship with your sister or a struggling business's rocky future. This meaning comes from a combination of the "uneven and covered with rocks" definition and the verb <i>rock</i>, or "sway back and forth." The Rocky Mountains, which aren't actually all that rocky, were named for the local Native American people, called "the stone Sioux" by their Cree neighbors.</p></div>`;
