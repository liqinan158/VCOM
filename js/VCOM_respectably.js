var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">respectably</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To do something <i>respectably</i> is to act in a proper, presentable, or acceptable way. If your dad asks you to dress <i>respectably</i> for a family wedding, he probably wants you to wear formal, tidy clothes.</p><p class="long">Sometimes <i>respectably</i> means "decently," or "politely," as when a teacher says, "Stop tap dancing on my desk! We behave <i>respectably</i> in this classroom." Other times, it means something more like "not bad," as when a business owner says, "Our sales team did <i>respectably</i> this quarter." At the root of this adverb is the Latin <i>respectus</i>, "regard," or "act of looking back at one."</p></div>`;
