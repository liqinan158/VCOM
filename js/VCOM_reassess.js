Now that you know the parents won't be home, you should <i>reassess</i> letting your kids go to the party.</p><p class="long">There are two sets of double <i>s</i>s in the word <i>reassess</i>. The prefix <i>re-</i> means "again," so <i>reassess</i> means to assess again. When you reassess a situation, you may change your position, but you may come to your original conclusion again. The word does not necessarily imply a change of opinion, just another review of the situation. In light of some math errors in the family budget, you reassess the costs of the vacation, but conclude it is still doable.</p></div></div>`;
