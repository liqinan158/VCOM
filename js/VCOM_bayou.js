Perhaps the most famous <i>bayou</i> in the United States is found in Louisiana.</p><p class="long">The term <i>bayou</i> is a true Americanism, most probably evolving in the early 19th Century from the Choctaw word <i>bayuk</i>, meaning "small stream," and making its way into the Louisiana French language. There is a culture specific to the Gulf of Mexico bayou areas from Texas to Florida, a mingling of the early Arcadian settlers, known as "Cajuns," and the Creole culture. The bayou is a fragile ecosystem that is threatened by pollutants and environmental disasters, such as oil spills.</p></div></div>`;
