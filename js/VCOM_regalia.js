If you see Miss America at the grocery store, you might not recognize her because she's not wearing her pageant <i>regalia</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Regalia</i> looks like <i>regal</i> and in fact, can refer to things owned by members of royalty that convey their official positions. Crowns, sashes, scepters, tiaras? Regalia. The prince's riding boots and the duchess's bath robes? Nope. Technically, <i>regalia</i> is a plural word, from Latin (the singular would be <i>regalis</i>) but it can be used with a singular or plural verb: Here is Queen Elizabeth's regalia. Her regalia are exquisite.</p></div>`;
