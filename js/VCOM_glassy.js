You can also describe shiny, glossy substances as <i>glassy</i>: "The <i>glassy</i> surface of the ice-covered sidewalk made her walk with tiny, careful steps." <i>Glassy</i> comes from the Old English <i>gl√¶s</i>, "glass," and its Proto-Indo-European root <i>ghel-</i>, "to shine."</p></div></div>`;
