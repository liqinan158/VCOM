We all feel <i>unappreciated</i> at times, but feeling that way might help us appreciate others.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>unappreciated</i> took shape in the mid-19th century. It evolved from the Latin <i>appretiƒÅre</i>, "to set a value on something." The word <i>unappreciated</i> can refer to anything that does not receive full credit, either positive or negative. For example, we might say that the possibilities of disaster due to global warming are still unappreciated by most people.</p></div>`;
