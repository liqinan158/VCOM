If you are a historian, you know that new evidence often controverts commonly-held beliefs, so history is constantly being revised and updated. Many children grew up learning that Christopher Columbus landed first in America, but now we have evidence to controvert that idea and other explorers such as Leif Eriksson beat Columbus to America.</p></div>`;
