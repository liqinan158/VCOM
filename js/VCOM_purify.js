You might decide to <i>purify</i> your tap water if it tastes like chlorine.</p><p class="long">While scientists purify various chemicals during experiments, the substance that people most often purify is water. Water needs to be treated before it's safe to drink, and cities purify the water they send out to people's houses. You can also use the verb <i>purify</i> in a figurative way, to mean "make ritually or religiously clean or pure." This is the word's earliest meaning, from the Latin root <i>purificare</i>, "to make pure."</p></div>`;
