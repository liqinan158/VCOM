If a dove builds a nest outside your open window, you'll be able to hear its <i>coos</i> every morning.</p><p class="long">There is a small, gray pigeon that's called a mourning dove because its coo is so sad sounding. When you hear a bird making this distinctive sound, you can also say that it coos â€” and if a person murmurs in a low, soft voice, you can say that she coos too. The word <i>coo</i> has been used since at least the late 1600s, and its origin is probably imitative, the word sounding very much like the sound it describes.</p></div>`;
