When kids play with <i>dolls</i>, they might dress them up, push them in toy strollers, and have pretend tea parties with them.</p><p class="long">Some dolls are the size of real babies and are played with in a way that's a kind of practice parenting â€” like pretending to feed and bathe a doll. Other dolls are much smaller and represent people of varying ages, like a family of dolls that are played with in a doll house, sitting at little tables and sleeping in tiny beds. The word <i>doll</i> is also an old-fashioned, slightly offensive term for a woman, especially one who's young and pretty.</p></div>`;
