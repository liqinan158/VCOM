When you're on a boat far out at sea, with no land in sight, there's water all <i>around</i> you.</p><p class="long"><i>Around</i> means "surrounding," and it can also mean "the opposite direction," as when you tell someone to turn around. You can also scatter things around, or put them here and there, or all over the place. When you need to estimate an amount, you can say, "We have <i>around</i> five dollars left." The word <i>around</i> wasn't used much before the 15th century, and today many of its uses are purely American â€” British speakers would say <i>about</i> instead.</p></div>`;
