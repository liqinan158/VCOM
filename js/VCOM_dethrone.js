var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">dethrone</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>dethrone</i> means to remove a king or queen from power, like when Mary, Queen of Scots was kicked out of Scotland. You can also <i>dethrone</i> someone less formally, as when you <i>dethrone</i> your school's fastest runner by beating her mile time.</p><p class="long">In today's politics, to force a leader out of office is to depose them â€” except in the case of a monarchy, when we use the word <i>dethrone</i>. It literally means "to remove from the throne" and therefore refers specifically to those who sit on thrones: namely, kings and queens. You can also use this word in a figurative way to mean "remove from a dominant position." So, for example, you can say that the new jump rope champion dethrones the previous record holder.</p></div>`;
