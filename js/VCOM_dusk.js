Many parents allow their children to roam freely in their neighborhood as long as they are home by <i>dusk</i>.</p><p class="long">For some, dusk is seen as a mysterious, almost magical time, serving as the bridge between the brightness of day and the darkness of night. The English language contains numerous synonyms for <i>dusk</i> including <i>crepuscule</i>, <i>evenfall</i>, and <i>gloaming</i>. Owing perhaps to the mystical qualities associated with dusk, these words are better suited for poetry than for daily use.</p></div></div>`;
