A radiator gets hot, and it sends that heat out into the room â€” in other words, it radiates heat. In fact, the word <i>radiator</i> originally meant "anything that radiates," including heat, light, or energy. By the 1850's, <i>radiator</i> had come to primarily mean "heater in a building or house."</p></div>`;
