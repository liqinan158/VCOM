"The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico <i>decimated</i> the wildlife along the coast."</p><p class="long">The verb <i>decimate</i> originally referred to a form of capital punishment for Roman troops. If there was a rebellion, one out of every <i>ten</i> men (thus the <i>dec</i> in <i>decimate</i>) was put to death. So the word's first expanded usage was to mean a ten percent reduction or a ten percent tax. Modern usage gives the word <i>decimate</i> its "drastically reduced" meaning, but the verb can also be used to mean "to wipe out" or "to eliminate."</p></div>`;
