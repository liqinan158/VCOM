Think very carefully before you <i>banish</i> someone from your group. Someday, you may want that person around again.</p><p class="long"><i>Banish</i> rhymes with <i>vanish</i>, which is exactly what happens when you banish someone. Suppose a king, angry with some of his subjects, banishes them. They have to leave the kingdom and vanish — not just go home and wait for the king to change his mind. <i>Banish</i> comes from the Old French word <i>banir</i>, which means “proclaim as an outlaw.” It is serious and absolute. You can see the word <i>ban</i> in <i>banish</i>, but to ban something is not as harsh as banishing it.</p></div></div>`;
