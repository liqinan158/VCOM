It takes <i>perceptiveness</i> to tell the difference between a genuine Matisse oil painting and a well-done copy.</p><p class="long">You use your perceptiveness to distinguish the flavor of a perfectly ripe peach from one that's not quite ready to be eaten, or to recognize a particularly well-written short story. You can also use the noun <i>perceptiveness</i> to mean a kind of understanding or comprehension â€” your perceptiveness can help you understand why a tired child is acting out. The Latin origin, also the root of <i>perceive</i>, is <i>percipere</i>, "obtain, gather, or seize," and also "to grasp with the mind."</p></div>`;
