Figuratively, <i>parallel</i> means similar, or happening at the same time. A story might describe the <i>parallel</i> lives of three close friends.</p><p class="long"><i>Parallel</i> is from Greek <i>parallēlos</i>, from the prefix <i>para-</i>, "beside," plus <i>allēlōn</i>, "of one another," from <i>allos</i>, "other." As a noun, a <i>parallel</i> is a way in which things resemble each other — you might draw parallels between the Vietnam War and the U.S. invasion of Iraq. In specialized use, a <i>parallel</i> can mean one of the imaginary circles on the surface of the Earth that are parallel to the equator — the 49th parallel divides the U.S. and Canada.</p></div>`;
