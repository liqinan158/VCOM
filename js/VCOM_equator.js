If you're freezing up there in Iceland, get yourself on down closer to the earth's <i>equator</i>, where it's nice and warm.</p><p class="long">An <i>equator</i> is an invisible line that divides a globe into two parts, north and south. To remember <i>equator</i>, recall the root "equa" from the Latin word <i>aequus</i>, meaning "equal." An equator makes things "equal." If you drew a line that divided a globe into two parts that were not equal, the line couldn't be called an <i>equator</i>. If you live at the North Pole and you're buddy lives at the South, meet halfway, somewhere along the equatorâ€”perhaps in Brazil, for Carnaval.</p></div></div>`;
