Geographers use <i>antipodal</i> for places that are on the exact opposite sides of the earth from each other.</p><p class="long">Parts of Spain are antipodal to New Zealand â€” in other words, if you drew a line straight through the center of the earth, you could connect those two countries. The Greek root of <i>antipodal</i> is <i>antipous</i>, "with feet opposite ours." You can also use this adjective figuratively to mean "opposed." If you and your brother couldn't be more different (you like vanilla, he prefers chocolate; you're a dog person, he loves cats), the two of you are antipodal.</p></div></div>`;
