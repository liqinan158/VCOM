Most kids go to school <i>clad</i> in jeans and t-shirts, but students in the Shakespeare club might show up <i>clad</i> in velvet gowns or leather breeches.</p><p class="long">As a verb, <i>clad</i> is the past tense and past particle of “clothe,” as in “the leprechaun clad himself in green.” It’s also an adjective that describes being covered or clothed, so a building can be clad in brick, while a person can be clad in head-to-toe sequins. It’s an old-fashioned word, kind of like “shod,” which means “wearing footwear.”</p></div>`;
