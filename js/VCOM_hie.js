It's the kind of word you are more likely hear in a Shakespeare play, like when a character demands, "<i>Hie</i> thee hither!"</p><p class="long">The verb <i>hie</i> is extremely old fashioned, so you're much more likely to read it in a book than to hear someone say it. Still, it's good to know when you read, "<i>Hie</i> thee to the castle!" that it means "Hey, get a move on! Go to the castle!" It comes from the Old English word <i>higian</i>, "strive or hasten," from a Proto-Germanic root.</p></div></div>`;
