These lines, cackled by the Weird Sisters in Shakespeare's <i>Macbeth</i>, are part of the most famous <i>incantation</i> — or magic spell made of words — in English literature.</p><p class="long"><i>Incantation</i> shares a Latin source with <i>enchant</i>, both of which are related to <i>chant</i>. An incantation, then, summons a thing or action into being with words that are sung, spoken, or written. Long before it became the catchword of stage magicians, <i>abracadabra</i> was regarded as a powerful incantation capable of warding off serious disease. The phrase <i>hocus pocus</i> may be a corruption of a seventeenth-century incantation spoken during the Roman Catholic liturgy of the Eucharist, "hoc est corpus meum" ("this is my body").</p></div>`;
