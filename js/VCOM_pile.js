If you pile rocks on top of each other, you will eventually have a...pile of rocks. Unlike the word <i>stack</i>, <i>pile</i> implies that your heap of stuff is fairly messy. It can also mean cram. When eight people pile into a car with only five seats, they’re likely to be pretty much squashed.</p></div>`;
