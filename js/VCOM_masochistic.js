His name became the German noun <i>Masochismus</i> and, eventually, the English adjective <i>masochistic.</i> Sometimes <i>masochistic</i> is used incorrectly or as slang to refer to someone who just does something mean, as in "taking the wings off of flies is <i>masochistic</i>," implying that the person enjoys the pain of another, when the word really is specific to the person receiving pain. (It's a sadistic person who enjoys inflicting pain on someone else.)</p></div></div>`;
