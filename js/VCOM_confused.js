If your new friend keeps impossibly showing up in different outfits, you'll be <i>confused</i> until you discover she has an identical twin.</p><p class="long"><i>Confuse</i> is a modern verb, the old form being <i>confound</i> which means "to bring to ruin or disorder." When you are confused, what's ruined is your sense of the order of things. If you return to a city where you used to live, and a dog grooming store has replaced your apartment and a dump has replaced the park, you'll feel emotionally confused. If you think that Tom is Harry and Harry is Tom, you've confused them in your mind.</p></div></div>`;
