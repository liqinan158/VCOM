These powerful athletes are able to lift enormous amounts of weight, often grunting loudly while they do so. Olympic weightlifters have three chances to lift a barbell weighing anywhere from 100 to 250 pounds. If you do bicep curls at home with 20-pound weights, you can still call yourself a weightlifter!</p></div></div>`;
