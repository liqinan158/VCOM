Before you cook dry beans, you <i>soak</i> them overnight first. If youâ€™re not a bean, you can also <i>soak</i> up a cool experience by immersing yourself in it.</p><p class="long">You can soak your dirty laundry in soapy water, or soak rice before you cook it, and you can also soak in a bubble bath. When you do this, you give these things (including yourself) a soak. Informally, the verb also means "immerse in an activity or experience," like when you soak up the applause after your masterful violin performance.</p></div></div>`;
