And in her most tender moments, you might have heard her in the yard, saying, “Here, pussy-pussy.” That’s because <i>pussy</i> is another word for <i>cat</i>. It’s also a word for a woman’s genitals. Generally, it’s considered offensive when it refers to a woman’s body. It’s probably not a word you should say to your math teacher or your mother. Unless you’re talking about the neighbor’s cat.</p></div>`;
