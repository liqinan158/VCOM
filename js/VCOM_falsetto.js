It's a voice so high it sounds false. A guy singing a mean <i>falsetto</i> could break a wine glass!</p><p class="long"><i>Falsetto</i> is a musical term for a male voice that's artificially high. <i>Falsetto</i> means “artificial voice” and comes from the Italian word <i>falso</i> for “false.” When men suddenly sing way up high above their speaking voices, it can sound almost fake. This word can also be used as an adjective — you could say he's a falsetto singer or a certain part should be sung with a falsetto voice. When you see the word <i>falsetto</i>, think "high voice."</p></div></div>`;
