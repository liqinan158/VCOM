When a surgeon uses a scalpel, she holds it using either the "dinner knife" grip, for large incisions, or the "pencil" grip, for smaller cuts. A medical student dissecting an animal also uses a scalpel, and in some cases artists use them for making fine cuts. In Latin, a <i>scalpellum</i> is a "surgical knife," from <i>scalpere</i>, "to carve."</p></div></div>`;
