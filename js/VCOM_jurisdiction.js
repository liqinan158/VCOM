var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">jurisdiction</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Jurisdiction</i> means having a legal right over something. A court can have <i>jurisdiction</i> over a legal question, and a government can have <i>jurisdiction</i> over another country or territory. Even your parents could be said to have <i>jurisdiction</i> over you while you're under 18.</p><p class="long">This noun <i>jurisdiction</i> descends from Latin <i>jūrisdictiō</i>, formed from <i>jūris</i> (from <i>jūs</i> "law") plus <i>dictio</i>, "the act of saying." Think of it as who has the right to "say" what "the law" is. In the U.S., certain crimes are tried in state courts, but when a crime involves more than one state, jurisdiction moves to the federal court system, just as the local police step down and the investigation is handled by the FBI.</p></div>`;
