If you find yourself approaching someone with a <i>malevolent</i> look in her eye, best to run the other way.</p><p class="long"><i>Malevolent</i> comes from the Latin word <i>malevolens</i>, which means "ill-disposed, spiteful"; its opposite is <i>benevolent</i>, which means "wishing good things for others."  A malevolent person might display satisfaction at someone else's problems. But it's not only individuals who can be malevolent. If you think that television violence influences viewers to violence, you see television as a malevolent force. The stress is on the second syllable: muh-LEV-uh-lent.</p></div></div>`;
