If you accidentally step on your cat's tail, you'll probably hear her <i>yowl</i>. Poor kitty.</p><p class="long">Use this imitative word as a noun or a verb, any time you're describing a wild cry of distress. Your new puppy may yowl all night long the first couple of times you make him sleep in a crate at the foot of your bed â€” and if his yowling goes on too long, you may find yourself starting to yowl along with him.</p></div></div>`;
