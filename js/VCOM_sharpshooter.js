The <i>sharp</i> bit is a bit of a stretch, but it is presumed to refer to the marksperson's eye; <i>sharpshooter</i> comes to us as a direct translation of the German <i>Scharfsch√ºtz.</i> Today the terms <i>sharpshooter</i>, <i>marksman</i>, and <i>sniper</i> tend to be used interchangeably.</p></div>`;
