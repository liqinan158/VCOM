If you find yourself in the midst of a pack of <i>clamorous</i> groupies going nuts over a celebrity sighting, you'll need to put your ear plugs in.</p><p class="long"><i>Clamorous</i> comes from the Latin root <i>clāmōr</i>, meaning "shout." If you're a clamorous person, you're not just loud, but you're also kind of aggressive about it. Town hall meetings with touchy subjects on the agenda tend to be clamorous affairs, as do championship playoffs, arguments between siblings, and daytime talk shows.</p></div>`;
