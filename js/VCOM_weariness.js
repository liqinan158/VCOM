Most people feel <i>weariness</i> after a long day of work. Marathons, babysitting small children, standardized tests, and getting old can also cause <i>weariness</i>.</p><p class="long">When you're weary, you're tired. Put a <i>–ness</i> at the end of the word to make a noun, and viola! weariness is the condition of feeling tired or fatigued. In fact, the familiar French loan word <i>fatigue</i> means “weariness.” Physical work (like helping someone move) or mental work (like reading a difficult book) can make you experience weariness. If a busy schedule is making you feel a general sense of weariness, it’s time for a vacation.</p></div>`;
