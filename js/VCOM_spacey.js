You might be a little <i>spacey</i> after you get your wisdom teeth removed.</p><p class="long">When people say funny things as they're coming out of anesthesia, acting silly or out of touch with reality, they're being spacey. You might also have a spacey friend who simply tends to be a little forgetful or quirky. This informal adjective, also spelled <i>spacy</i>, originally meant "roomy" and then "acting or feeling as if you're in outer space," probably from 1965 American slang, <i>spaced-out</i>.</p></div>`;
