var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">sweep</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you use a broom to clean the floor, you <i>sweep</i>. You also <i>sweep</i> when you move in a smooth, confident way, like when you <i>sweep</i> onto the dance floor in a dazzling new outfit.</p><p class="long">A barber sweeps up hair from the the barber shop floor, and your melodramatic brother sweeps his homework off his desk with his arm when he's frustrated. You can also use <i>sweep</i>for things that move fast, like a car sweeping down a driveway or fire that sweeps through a forest. Informally, <i>sweep</i> also means "to win every contest," like when your favorite team sweeps the World Series. This usage comes from an older meaning, "winning all hands in a card game."</p></div></div>`;
