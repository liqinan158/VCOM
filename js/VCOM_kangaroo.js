If you visit Australia (or the zoo), you may see a <i>kangaroo</i>.</p><p class="long">Kangaroos are known for their habits of sitting upright and springing great distances. Female kangaroos have pouches in which they carry their babies. The word <i>kangaroo</i> is thought to come from a now-extinct Aboriginal language's word for a specific kind of kangaroo, <i>gaNurru</i> or <i>gang-oo-roo</i>.
