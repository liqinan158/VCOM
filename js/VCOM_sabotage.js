Loosening the blades on your competitor's ice skates would definitely be considered <i>sabotage</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Sabotage</i> comes from the French word <i>saboter</i>, which literally means “walk noisily.” That's funny, because the last thing you'd want to do when committing an act of sabotage is stomp around and get caught. It’s believed that <i>sabotage</i> came into use in 1910 as a noun, and then later in 1918 as a verb. Apparently, people only became so cruel in the last century or so.</p></div></div>`;
