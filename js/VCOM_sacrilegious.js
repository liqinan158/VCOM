An action that causes deep offense to a believer — like burning a religious text, for example — is <i>sacrilegious</i>.</p><p class="long">The Latin <i>sacrilegus</i>, "thief of sacred things," was used to describe robbers who plundered graves and temples. Anything that's sacrilegious is essentially as disrespectful as a graverobber towards things that others find holy or solemn and serious. In modern ironic usage, a sacrilegious opinion runs contrary to popular wisdom or deeply held beliefs. Calling the movie <i>Citizen Kane</i> boring and self-indulgent is totally sacrilegious to many movie lovers.</p></div>`;
