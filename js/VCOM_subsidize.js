Don't expect your parents to <i>subsidize</i> your addiction to solid-gold puppy figurines.</p><p class="long">We can break down the word <i>subsidize</i> to help us remember its meaning. The prefix <i>sub-</i> means  "under, below" and <i>sedÄ“re</i> means "to sit." (A <i>sub</i>marine is a ship that goes under the sea.) So to <i>subsidize</i> is to underwrite something financially, providing the support that keeps it going. For example, our taxes are used by the government to subsidize many educational and social programs.</p></div></div>`;
