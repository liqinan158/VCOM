Religious leaders, saints, and martyrs are often considered as <i>revered</i>. Celebrities? Not so much. There's a touch of the other worldly about <i>revered.</i></p><p class="long">The origins of <i>revered</i> reveal something about its slightly scary, awesome nature. It comes from the Latin word <i>revereri,</i> meaning "to fear," and the addition of the "re" at the beginning is an expression of intensive force, so the word literally means "to greatly fear." People whom are revered are not necessarily those we feel most comfortable around; we are too busy holding them in awe.</p></div></div>`;
