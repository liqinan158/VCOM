To be <i>mutinous</i> is to behave this way, like when the entire class rises up against a substitute teacher.</p><p class="long">Mutinous behavior is largely associated with the behavior of unhappy crews at sea. A mutinous crew can really mess up a ship captain's day, but then again serve as a fantastic source of material for books and movies. There's something inspiring about mutinous behavior â€” it shows a certain defiant independent spirit that is admirable, unless of course you're the leader being mutinied against.</p></div>`;
