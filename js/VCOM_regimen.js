var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">regimen</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>regimen</i> is a systematic plan for some kind of therapy. If your doctor tells you to eat more vegetables, cut out potato chips, exercise, and take vitamins, she is prescribing a <i>regimen</i> for better health.</p><p class="long">It's easy to confuse <i>regimen</i> with <i>regime</i>. While both words can refer to an organized plan for diet, exercise, or medical therapy, only <i>regime</i> can refer to a system of government. If you wash your face twice a day, apply medicine to your acne, and use a special lotion, that's your skin-care <i>regimen</i>. But if a country votes out the ruling party in favor of new leaders, that's a new <i>regime</i>.</p></div>`;
