You might like to wear <i>couture</i> styles, but your job at the ice cream shop makes jeans and T-shirts a more appropriate choice.</p><p class="long">Haute couture, or "high" couture, is a step above couture, referring to the most exclusive designers and their wares. The closest the average person gets to haute couture is watching movie stars walk the red carpet on Oscar night. If you like couture but live on a budget, you can shop at high-end consignment shops. Or if you can sew and have an artistic bent, you can design your own couture gowns for yourself and your friends.</p></div>`;
