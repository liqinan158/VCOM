Also, anything good <i>profits</i> you — it benefits you.</p><p class="long">When we talk about <i>profits</i>, we're talking about coming out ahead. Businesses need to make a profit — money — or they'll have to fire employees, cut expenses, and maybe go out of business entirely. If more money is coming in than going out, that's a profit. <i>Profit</i> also means a benefit. For example, you could profit from playing baseball even if you made no money from it. Getting exercise and fun would profit anybody quite a bit.</p></div></div>`;
