Once you know the <i>scope</i> of a project, you can decide if you're qualified and how much time it will take to do it.</p><p class="long">If your boss gives you a new task and you don't want to do it, tell him or her it's not within the scope of your duties. A <i>scope</i> is also a device used to see something in the distance.  You'll find one on shotguns, submarines, radars and the like. You can use <i>scope</i> as a verb meaning "to look out or around." When you and your friends go out, you probably scope out a few places to see where the action is.</p></div></div>`;
