If neighborhood dogs got into a cupcake shop, they would probably <i>ransack</i> it.</p><p class="long">You can use the verb <i>ransack</i> to describe a careful search â€” you might ransack your backpack looking for your car keys, for example. Marauding armies, feral cats, burglars, and other troublemakers are often described as ransacking towns, rooms, gardens, or shops, especially if they take things and leave disarray in their wake. The word <i>ransack</i> comes from the Old Norse <i>rannsaka</i>, which has a similar meaning but is literally "search the house."</p></div>`;
