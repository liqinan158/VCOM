The word's roots go back to the Latin word "arcus," which means arc or bow.</p><p class="long">An arched, covered passageway with shops or stalls on the sides is also called an <i>arcade</i> and was a precursor to the shopping mall. The Burlington Arcade in London opened in 1819 and was the first shopping arcade of its kind in Britain. It still exists and is the longest covered shopping street in England. As more of these shopping arcades opened, they also began offering games and eventually the word's meaning came to include video arcades, where you can play coin-operated games.</p></div></div>`;
