When you visit the site of a long uninhabited city, the broken down structures you see are <i>ruins</i> — time and neglect has resulted in ruined buildings. Both words come from the Latin <i>ruere</i>, "to fall." Opening the oven door too soon can yield a ruined soufflé — it could literally fall, or collapse into a squishy mess. Your reputation as a cook might also be described as <i>ruined</i> after such a disaster.</p></div>`;
