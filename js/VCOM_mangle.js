A bad accident will mangle your bicycle, bending it beyond repair, and a paper shredder mangles a document by slicing it up. You can also use the word <i>mangle</i> to describe what happens when your uncle's terrible bluegrass band performs a cover of your favorite classic rock song â€” they mangle it.</p></div>`;
