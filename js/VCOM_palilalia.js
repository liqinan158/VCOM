Sometimes <i>palilalia</i> can be a symptom of Alzheimer's disease.</p><p class="long">The speech condition known as palilalia can sound at first like a stutter — it causes a speaker to involuntarily repeat words, syllables, or even whole phrases. It's also similar to <i>echolalia</i>, a disorder in which a speaker repeats other people's words. But while echolalia tends to make no logical sense, palilalia is correct speech that's repeated automatically. The Greek roots of <i>palilalia</i> are <i>pálin</i>, "again," and <i>laliá</i>, "to speak."</p></div>`;
