The finished books that <i>biographers</i> publish are called biographies.</p><p class="long">In some cases, well-known writers, actors, and other public figures work with biographers in order to collaborate on their own biographies. Other times, biographers research the lives of their subjects after they've died. In the 1660s, they were known as <i>biographists</i>. The root of all variations on <i>biography</i> is the Late Greek <i>biographia</i>, "description of life," from <i>bio-</i>, "life," and <i>graphia</i>, "record or account."</p></div></div>`;
