When you travel for work, you get a <i>reimbursement</i> for your work-related expenses, like hotel bills and plane tickets, but you'll have to pay for that trip to the circus yourself.</p><p class="long"><i>Reimbursement</i> comes from the Latin root words <i>re</i>, meaning again; <i>in</i>, meaning into; and <i>bursa</i>, meaning purse. So the word <i>reimbursement</i> literally means in a purse again. After your parents' basement flooded, they paid to repair the damage and then got a reimbursement from the insurance company, so that they could put the money they spent in their purse again.</p></div></div>`;
