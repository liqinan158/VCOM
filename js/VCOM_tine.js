When you were little, you may have lined up your peas on the <i>tines</i> of your fork despite your parents telling you not to play with your food.</p><p class="long">The tines of a fork are what make it possible to spear pieces of food with it. Other objects with similarly sharp points can also be described as having tines â€” like a pitchfork or the antler of a deer. The pointed end on a dental tool is also called a tine. The origins of the word <i>tine</i> can be traced back to the Old English <i>tind</i>, which means "sharp point," and is related to the German word <i>Zinne</i>, or "pinnacle."</p></div></div>`;
