While a <i>calliope</i> is played using a piano keyboard, the sound is so loud it can often be heard from miles away.</p><p class="long">During the Industrial Revolution, steam was used to power all sorts of things, from trains to riverboats to circus carousels. Calliopes were invented as a perfect accompaniment to this "age of steam." Calliopes were known for their loud, harsh tones that sound very similar to train whistles. Even though no one would argue that a calliope sounds lovely, the name comes from the beautiful-voiced Greek Muse <i>Kalliope</i>.</p></div></div>`;
