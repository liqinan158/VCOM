var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">algorithm</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Whether you are doing simple multiplication or a complicated calculus problem, you must use a predetermined set of rules, called an <i>algorithm</i>, to solve it. An <i>algorithm</i> includes a finite number of steps to solve any given problem.</p><p class="long">The word  <i>algorithm</i> has an unusual backstory. It seems the 9th Century Persian mathematician Al-Khwārizmī wrote about calculations, and when his work was translated into Latin 300 years later, his name was somehow incorporated into the name of the process as <i>Algoritmi</i>. This got confused with the Greek word for number, <i>arithmos</i>, leading to the evolution of the word as we know it. It's a mish-mash, ironic for a word that stands for a rather rigid set of rules.</p></div>`;
