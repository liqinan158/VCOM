Two players compete in <i>checkers</i> to have the last piece on the board.</p><p class="long">The game pieces in checkers — which you can also call <i>checkers</i> — are usually red and black. Players move diagonally on the board, trying to reach the opposite side where their pieces can be "kinged," or doubled, giving them more powers. On the way, a player attempts to jump over her opponent's pieces and capture them. In Britain, the identical game is called "draughts."</p></div>`;
