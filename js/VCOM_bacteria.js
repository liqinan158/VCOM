They can be dangerous, such as when they cause infection, or beneficial, as in the process of fermentation (such as in wine) and that of decomposition.</p><p class="long">In 1676, Anton Van Leeuwenhoek first observed bacteria through a microscope and called them “animalcules.” In 1838, the German Naturalist Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg called them <i>bacteria</i>, from the Greek <i>baktḗria</i>, meaning "little stick." An apt word, as the first observed bacteria were shaped like rods, although bacteria can also be spiral or spherical in shape. A grammar note: The word <i>bacteria</i> is the plural form of "bacterium" and so should be written as plural, as in "Many bacteria are harmless."</p></div>`;
