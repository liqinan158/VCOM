When you give your first speech in front of a crowd, don't be surprised to hear a <i>quaver</i> in your voice.</p><p class="long">The nervous or emotional tremor in a person's speaking voice is one kind of quaver. It's also a primarily British term for an eighth note in music. To quaver can mean both to speak in a trembling voice, or to sing in a similar way, with a little warble or trill. The fifteenth century meaning of <i>quaver</i> is "to tremble or vibrate," and it's related to the earlier <i>cwavien</i>, "to shake," from the Low German word <i>quabbeln</i>, "tremble."</p></div>`;
