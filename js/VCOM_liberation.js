Wild animals raised in captivity are often unprepared for their <i>liberation</i> when they are released back into the wild.</p><p class="long">You'll notice right off the bat that <i>liberation</i> is related to the noun <i>liberty</i> â€” as in "liberty and justice for all." The difference is that <i>liberation</i> refers specifically to the act of being made free, of going from having no freedom to having it. Famous moments of liberation include Europe's liberation from the Nazis, the slaves' liberation from slavery in the U.S., and South Africa's liberation from the oppression of apartheid.</p></div>`;
