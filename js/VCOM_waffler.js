No, chocolate!"</p><p class="long">As a verb, to <i>waffle</i> means to go back and forth between possibilities, rather than making a definitive decision, and to be a waffler is to act this way. It's clear you're a waffler if people tend to sigh impatiently while they wait for you to make up your mind about something. "You're such a waffler, you'll never be able to decide on a kitten â€” let me pick one, or they'll all be adopted and we'll miss our chance!"</p></div></div>`;
