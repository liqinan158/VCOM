In other words, <i>eventual</i> is not used to randomly predict the future. You may hope to win the lottery in the future, but you can't talk about your eventual lottery win because you have no way to guarantee your numbers will be chosen â€” unless you've figured out a way to rig the system. If you have, maybe you should think about your eventual jail time.</p></div></div>`;
