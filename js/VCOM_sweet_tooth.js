Someone with a <i>sweet tooth</i> is likely to have a cinnamon roll for breakfast instead of an omelet.</p><p class="long">Most people who profess to having a sweet tooth are big fans of dessert. The phrase has been used in English for hundreds of years, since the late fourteenth century, and it comes from <i>toothsome</i>, an even older word meaning "delicious or tasty." This sense of <i>tooth</i> standing in for <i>taste</i> gave rise to <i>sweet tooth</i>, or "particularly enjoying sweet tastes."</p></div></div>`;
