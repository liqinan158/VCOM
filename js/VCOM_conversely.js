It is often used to introduce an idea that is different from one stated before.  You say the photo is a fake.  <i>Conversely</i>, the photographer claims it's real.</p><p class="long">The adverb <i>conversely</i> has its origin in the Latin word <i>convertere</i>, which means "to turn about."  In the following quote by Journalist Andy Rooney note how the word balances the two sentences: "The closing of a door can bring blessed privacy and comfort - the opening, terror. <i>Conversely</i>, the closing of a door can be a sad and final thing - the opening a wonderfully joyous moment."</p></div>`;
