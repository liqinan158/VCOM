She's the doctor who examines your eyes and writes the prescription for your contact lenses. The Greek root word is <i>ophthalmos</i>, which means "eye." <i>Ophthalmologist</i> is a tricky word to spell, particularly because many people tend to skip both the "ph" and the first "l" when they pronounce it.</p></div></div>`;
