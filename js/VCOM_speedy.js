If you're a <i>speedy</i> driver, you keep your foot on the gas pedal and zip by all the slowpokes. <i>Speedy</i> is also the nickname for a cartoon who is “the fastest mouse in Mexico.”</p><p class="long">Anything that's speedy moves with rapid speed, whether it's a bullet train or a waiter bringing coffee before you’ve even finished ordering it. If your brother sends you on an errand, he might call, "Be <i>speedy</i>!" especially if you're known for taking your time. The Old English root of <i>speedy</i> is <i>spedig</i>, which curiously means "wealthy." A now old fashioned meaning of "speed," in fact, was "success" or "prosperity.”</p></div>`;
