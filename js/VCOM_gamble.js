When an entrepreneur invests her own money in her business, she <i>gambles</i> on its success.</p><p class="long">If you approach a stray dog, you gamble on its friendliness, and if you turn down a high-paying job to take a more interesting position, you gamble on it eventually paying off. Another way to gamble is to buy a lottery ticket or place a bet on a poker hand: when you gamble like this, you play a game of chance, risking some amount of money. <i>Gamble</i> is from Old English <i>gammlen</i>, "to play, jest, or be merry."</p></div>`;
