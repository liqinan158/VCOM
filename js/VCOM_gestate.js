Did he think of it right away, or did it take months for him to come up with the idea?</p><p class="long">When something is gestating, it's literally in the womb, developing into whatever it will be when it's finally born. Other things besides living organisms can gestate, however. Frequently, <i>gestate</i> is used to refer to ideas and plans while they're in the development phase.
