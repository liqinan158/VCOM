Silk is a common <i>fabric</i>, but you can also talk about "the <i>fabric</i> of society."</p><p class="long">The most common use of <i>fabric</i> is for clothes: for example, denim is the fabric used to make jeans. All clothes are made of some type or combination of fabrics. The basic structure of a building or a vehicle can also be called fabric, and non-physical things can be represented as fabric too. Metaphorically, you could say honesty is part of the fabric of friendship, or love is part of the fabric of family. Fabric is always the foundation or essence of something.</p></div></div>`;
