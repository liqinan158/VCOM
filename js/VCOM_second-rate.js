If you buy a cheap <i>second-rate</i> car, you may end up spending a lot on repairs instead.</p><p class="long">Second-rate things are mediocre, shabby, or inferior. A second-rate production of <i>Hamlet</i> won't be as well done as the Royal Shakespeare Company's performance in Stratford-upon-Avon. And a second-rate cup of coffee might need a lot more cream and sugar than a first-rate cup, but it will cost much less. The adjective <i>second-rate</i> was first used to describe ships, from the British Navy's official classification system.</p></div>`;
