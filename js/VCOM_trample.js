If you fall down during a footrace, another runner might <i>trample</i> you.</p><p class="long">When you trample, you're stomping or stamping: it's the opposite of walking on tippy toes. A dog might trample a flower garden while chasing a ball, and an angry child might deliberately trample her sister's sandcastle, flattening it with her feet. The verb <i>trample</i> comes from <i>tramp</i>, "walk heavily or stamp," which is rooted in the Middle Low German word <i>trampen</i>, "to tramp, stamp, or press upon."</p></div>`;
