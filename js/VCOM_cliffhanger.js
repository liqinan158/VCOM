If your favorite show ends its season with a <i>cliffhanger</i>, you'll have to wait months to find out what happens next.</p><p class="long">The key to a good cliffhanger is a character in some precarious position â€” this keeps the plot exciting, and it also ensures that the audience will return to see how dilemmas are resolved. In the case of a book, a cliffhanger keeps you turning the pages. The use of cliffhangers goes back to Homer's "Odyssey," though the word itself dates from 1937, from serial movies that would sometimes literally leave characters dangling from a cliff at the end.</p></div>`;
