Another kind of <i>thoughtfulness</i> describes deliberate thinking before doing something. It might, for example, require some thoughtfulness to figure out how to hook up your new TV. The word comes from the adjective <i>thoughtful</i>, which originally meant "moody or anxious," but came to mean "considerate" in the 1850's.</p></div>`;
