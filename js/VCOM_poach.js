On the other hand, when you <i>poach</i> an egg, it's perfectly legal — you just cook it in simmering water.</p><p class="long">Hunters are only permitted to hunt certain animals during specific times of the year, and only in certain locations. If a hunter shoots a rabbit on another person's private land, you can say she <i>poaches</i> it. This meaning probably stems from the Middle French <i>pocher</i>, "to thrust." Another theory connects it to the "cook in hot liquid" meaning of <i>poach</i> and its Old French root <i>poché</i>, "put into a pocket."</p></div></div>`;
