When you walk behind a horse, it's important to stay far enough away from its <i>haunches</i> that you won't get kicked.</p><p class="long">You can use the word <i>haunch</i> for the hind parts of a four-legged animal or for the hip and thigh of a person. When you squat like a catcher in baseball, you sit on your haunches, and a cow with an itchy backside might rub its haunch against a fence post. The word stems from <i>hanche</i>, which means "hip or thigh" in Old French, from a Germanic root.</p></div>`;
