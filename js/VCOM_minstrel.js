The <i>minstrel</i> would keep your household amused by playing music and singing songs about faraway places.</p><p class="long">The word <i>minstrel</i> traces back to the Old French word <i>menestral</i>, meaning “entertainer, servant.” In medieval times, nobles would often employ a minstrel to recite poems and sing songs accompanied by music, so the minstrel was both entertainer and servant. A “wandering <i>minstrel</i>” is a singer who wanders from house to house for pay. Minstrel shows were traveling variety shows in 19th century America, considered offensive now because performers often wore "blackface" makeup and performed ugly racial stereotypes.</p></div>`;
