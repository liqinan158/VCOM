The National Basketball Association is an example of the business meaning of <i>association</i> — a formal organization or group that works together. If you ask, "What is your association with Bill?" That just means, "How are you connected to Bill?" You can also make mental associations — you might make an association between the smell of fresh bread and your grandmother's kitchen, for example.</p></div></div>`;
