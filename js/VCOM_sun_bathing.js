Many people enjoy <i>sun bathing</i> when they go to the beach.</p><p class="long">You can spell <i>sun bathing</i> as a single word or as two separate words — and you can also call it <i>sun tanning</i>, although <i>sun bathing</i> can mean simply enjoying the warmth of the sun on your skin, rather than going for a dark tan. The term became popular in the 1940's, when people began to seek the sun — and resulting tanned skin — for health and fashion reasons. The term <i>sunbather</i> seems to have first appeared in 1941, with <i>sun bathing</i> following closely behind.</p></div></div>`;
