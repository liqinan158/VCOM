If you tend to accidentally lock yourself out of your car, it's a good idea to carry a <i>duplicate</i> key with you just in case.</p><p class="long">The word <i>duplicate</i> is useful when you're talking about a copy of something, like a duplicate of your birth certificate that you keep in a file, or a duplicate driver's license that you apply for after losing the original one. The verb <i>duplicate</i> is pronounced differently, with a long <i>a</i> sound, and it means to make a copy of or to multiply times two. The Latin root, <i>duplicatus</i>, means "to double."</p></div></div>`;
