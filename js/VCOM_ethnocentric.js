var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">ethnocentric</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Someone who's <i>ethnocentric</i> judges other cultures by comparing them to his own, familiar culture. An <i>ethnocentric</i> American might compare all the cities of the world to New York City, overlooking their unique charms.</p><p class="long">If you use the standards of your own culture to judge another culture, you're being ethnocentric. One example of this is the mentality that all places should be like one's own country. The word <i>ethnocentric</i> takes the Greek prefix <i>ethno-</i>, "people or nation," and combines it with <i>kentrikos</i>, "center." It was originally a social science term, but it gained popularity in the second half of the 20th century.</p></div>`;
