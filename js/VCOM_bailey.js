The <i>bailey</i> of a medieval castle was usually built of stone.</p><p class="long">You might see a bailey — or the remains of one — if you tour a castle in England or France. The word <i>bailey</i> is used both to describe the defensive wall around a castle courtyard, or sometimes the courtyard itself. This type of castle design was especially common in twelfth century England. The word comes from the Old French <i>bail</i>, "stake, palisade, or brace," which may be rooted in the Latin <i>bacula</i>, "sticks."</p></div>`;
