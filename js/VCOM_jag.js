The walls of a cave, rather than being smooth, might be lined with rocky <i>jags</i>.</p><p class="long">You'll encounter jags when you're mountain climbing or walking along the rocky coast. To "be on a <i>jag</i>" or "go on a <i>jag</i>" means to be completely unrestrained, whether you're on a drinking jag or a crying jag. This second meaning is of U.S. origin, first meaning "a load of hay or wood," and later "as much drink as a man can hold," in the 17th century. By the 1880s, it was "a period of unrestrained activity."</p></div></div>`;
