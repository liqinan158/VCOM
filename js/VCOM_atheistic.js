Or in any gods for that matter.  You’re also probably not interested in praying or participating in religious rituals.</p><p class="long">The French root of <i>atheistic</i> literally translates to “without god,” and that’s how atheistic folks choose to live — with no god talk affecting their decisions.  Some people who are atheistic actually get together to discuss their lack of belief, called <i>atheism</i>. <i>Atheistic</i> is an exception to the rule about “<i>i</i> before <i>e</i> except after <i>c</i>,” so watch out for that.</p></div>`;
