It's so amazing that people often use this word to describe things that remind them of geysers. If you suddenly make a lot of money, you hit a geyser. If someone is crying uncontrollably, that's a geyser of emotion. If you're writing quickly and well, it feels like a geyser of words. Anything powerfully flowing could be considered a geyser.</p></div></div>`;
