The <i>larynx</i> does all sorts of important things besides housing the vocal cords (which are actually folds, not cords). The larynx is involved in breathing, and it also helps keep food from entering your windpipe when you swallow. All mammals have one — the wolf that howls, the lion that roars, and Tarzan, who makes that — whatever that sound is he makes.</p></div>`;
