Many of these businesses and services aren't even located in New York, but they're still part of the finance industry referred to as Wall Street. The eight-block street itself probably got its name from a protective wooden wall built by Dutch settlers, and after the Civil War, Wall Street became the financial center of the country.</p></div></div>`;
