A <i>chauvinistic</i> man might say women are too emotional to hold stressful jobs.</p><p class="long">If you believe that your gender, culture, country, or group is inherently better than another, you are chauvinistic, which is pronounced "sho-van-IS-tick." <i>Chauvinistic</i> is used often to describe sexism, but it also means extreme patriotism, or the belief that your country is better than others. In fact, the root is the French <i>chauvinisme</i>, "exaggerated, blind patriotism," which comes from Nicholas Chauvin, a famously nationalistic Napoleonic soldier.</p></div>`;
