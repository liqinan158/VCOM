If someone asks you to do something <i>pronto</i>, they want it done now.</p><p class="long">Sometimes parents, bosses, and teachers need you to do something fast: one word that carries this meaning is <i>pronto</i>, which comes from Italian and originally applied to playing music quickly. If your dad says, "Take out the trash <i>pronto</i>!" he wants you to take it out now. If your boss asks you to finish a project pronto, she wants you to finish it right away. <i>Pronto</i> means about the same as ASAP, which stands for "as soon as possible."</p></div>`;
