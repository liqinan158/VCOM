If you have steady hands, you can <i>trim</i> your own bangs. If you don't have steady hands, you can save up for a professional haircut by <i>trimming</i> the amount of money you spend on comics and snacks.</p><p class="long">A landscaper trims the grass and shrubs, and a cook trims fat off of meat before cooking it. But when you trim the Christmas tree, you decorate it, and when a sailor trims the sails, she adjusts them so they'll catch the wind just right. And as a noun, a <i>trim</i> is "an act of cutting," while <i>trim</i> is "decoration." All forms of this word are rooted in nautical language.</p></div></div>`;
