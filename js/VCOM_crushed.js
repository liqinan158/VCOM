It's less pleasant to see your car's crushed fender after an accident, or to end up with a crushed toe after accidentally dropping a brick on your foot. A figurative way to be <i>crushed</i> is to be completely devastated or humiliated: "She had a <i>crushed</i> expression on her face after losing the spelling bee."</p></div></div>`;
