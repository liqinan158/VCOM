You can be <i>fortunate</i> to have avoided something terrible and you can be <i>fortunate</i> to have acquired, won, or been bestowed with something better than those around you, like wealth and good looks.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>fortunate</i> comes from the Latin word <i>fortunatus</i>, meaning “prospered,” “prosperous,” “lucky,” or “happy.” <i>Fortunate</i> is related to the word <i>fortune</i> and they have similar meanings, in the sense that those fortunate enough to have a fortune most likely have gobs of money and are sometimes called “the <i>fortunate</i>.” When it comes to predicting the future, you could get bad news from a fortune teller about what’s in store for you, but if you’re fortunate — she’ll say something good.</p></div>`;
