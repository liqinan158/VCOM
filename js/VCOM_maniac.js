Screaming like a <i>maniac</i> is never a good way to get your point across.</p><p class="long">Long ago, the word <i>maniac</i> was an official psychiatric term that meant "a patient suffering from mania," or manic disorder, involving a euphoric mood and extreme energy. <i>Maniac</i> isn't used in a clinical way anymore, but only informally to mean "lunatic." You might describe yourself running around the house like a maniac looking for your car keys, or dismiss your sports-obsessed brother as "a football <i>maniac</i>." The Greek root is <i>mania</i>, or "madness."</p></div></div>`;
