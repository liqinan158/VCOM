Or you may want to cut out the rotted parts and use the rest. And when you walk in the woods, you'll see a lot of rotted things if you look, like rotted tree stumps and last year's layer of rotted leaves. <i>Rotted</i>, from the verb <i>rot</i>, is rooted in the Old English <i>rotian</i>, "to decay or putrefy."</p></div></div>`;
