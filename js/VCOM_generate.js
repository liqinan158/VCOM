A good stock pick might <i>generate</i> cash, and a good idea might <i>generate</i> the basis for an Oscar-winning film.</p><p class="long"><i>Generate</i> and the closely related word <i>generation</i> both come from the Latin word <i>genus</i>, which means "stock or race." Its root, in turn, is the Proto-Indo-European <i>gen-</i>, "to produce, give birth, or beget." Let's say you have two siblings. In that case, your parents' marriage has generated three children. In a hydroelectric power plant, water generates power. And you can get a paper route or babysit if you're looking to generate a little income.</p></div>`;
