A <i>cloudy</i> day isn't ideal for a trip to the beach, and a <i>cloudy</i> night isn't great for star gazing.</p><p class="long">A cloudy sky tells you that rain's on the way, while a cloudy pond or a cloudy glass of water isn't translucent â€” you can't see through it. You can also describe an issue, thought, or memory as cloudy when it's vague or half-remembered or unclear. <i>Cloudy</i> comes from the Old English word <i>clud</i>, "mass of rock," and later "cloud," based on the way a cloud can resemble a rock or hill.</p></div></div>`;
