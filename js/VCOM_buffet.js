var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">buffet</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you see the word <i>buffet</i>, it's hard not to think "all-you-can-eat."  Although the noun can refer to food set out for self-service, <i>buffet</i> also means "a blow, especially with the hand" or, as a verb, "to strike sharply."</p><p class="long">The two meanings of <i>buffet</i> come from very different sources. The self-serve meal <i>buffet</i> — from 18th century French and pronounced buh-FAY —  is named after a piece of furniture, <i>bufet</i> ("sideboard"), on which such a meal might be served. The meaning of hitting, however, comes from the Old French word <i>bufe</i>, "a blow" or "a puff of wind," and is pronounced BUH-fit.  If the wind buffets the windows of your house, it can make them rattle in their frames, and if you are buffeted by bad news, you might shake in your shoes.</p></div>`;
