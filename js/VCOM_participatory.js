In high school, classes are <i>participatory</i>: they require you to join in by doing your homework and taking part in discussions.</p><p class="long">Education research shows that participatory lessons, or lessons in which the students participate in their own learning, are more effective than direct instruction. For example, a participatory activity in which students take a classroom poll of favorite fruits and analyze what percentages of the class like which kinds is much more likely to stick with them than a non-participatory lecture on percentage.</p></div></div>`;
