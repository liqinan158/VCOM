If you <i>resolutely</i> sit down and do your math homework, you'll work hard at it until it's done.</p><p class="long">The adverb <i>resolutely</i> is perfect for describing something you do in a strong, purposeful way. You might resolutely decide to clean your room, and immediately make your bed and start filling up a garbage bag. Strangely, the original meaning of <i>resolutely</i> and its adjective form, <i>resolute</i>, was almost completely opposite to its meaning now: it meant "dissolved, or of loose structure," from a Latin root word, <i>resolvere</i>, "untie, unfasten, or loose."</p></div>`;
