var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">diminution</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you "dim" a light, you reduce the brightness coming from the bulb. <i>Diminution</i> (not actually related to "dim") is the lessening of something to a smaller size or lower status, as a <i>diminution</i> of your "superpowers" when you wake up from a dream.</p><p class="long">Pronouncing <i>diminution</i> (dim-ih-NYOO-shun) only seems to get harder the more you repeat it, but memorizing the meaning and sounds with "diminish" and "ammunition" helps. If you take away the firepower in a battle, for example, you diminish the ammunition, causing a diminution of the army's power. A <i>diminution</i> is a decrease of size, time, or esteem. Does the word still sound funny? Let's try a diminution, or reduction, of the number of times we say it â€” starting now.</p></div>`;
