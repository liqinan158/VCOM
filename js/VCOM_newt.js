A <i>newt</i> looks like a cross between a frog and a lizard.</p><p class="long">Newts are a type of salamander that primarily lives on land but also has gills that enable it to occasionally live an aquatic life. The word <i>newt</i> comes from <i>an ewte</i>, and the Old English <i>efte</i>, "small, lizard-like animal." These little lizard-like animals have four short legs, often with webbed toes, and dry skin. When out of the water, newts seek out shady areas where they can stay cool.</p></div></div>`;
