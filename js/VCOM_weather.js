People tend to talk about the <i>weather</i> when they can't think of anything else to talk about.</p><p class="long">In some places, people say, "Don't like the <i>weather</i>? Wait an hour and it'll change." Every day, experts try to predict the weather, but they never get it exactly right. You can also use <i>weather</i> to mean "endure something," as in "I <i>weathered</i> the storm at work." That's not a real storm, but a stormy situation. Even though the weather drives us all crazy at times, at least it gives us something to blab about.</p></div></div>`;
