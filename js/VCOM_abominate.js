You might abominate your curfew, or the substitute teacher for your math class. Picture a preacher telling you, "<i>Abominate</i> sin!"</p><p class="long"><i>Abominate</i> comes from the Latin verb <i>abominari</i>, which comes from <i>ab-</i>, meaning “away from,” and <i>omin</i>, meaning “omen.” You might consider something you abominate — the sound of nails on a chalkboard, for many — to be as thoroughly bad as a bad omen itself. You avoid that sound at all costs, the way some people avoid a black cat crossing the street.</p></div></div>`;
