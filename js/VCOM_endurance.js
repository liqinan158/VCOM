If you decide to run a marathon, you will need lots of <i>endurance</i> to run over 26 miles.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>endurance</i> contains <i>endure</i>, which means "to suffer or undergo" and the suffix <i>-ance</i> means "the state of." It can be used to describe the physical strength to keep going, as in a marathon or giving birth, but it can also be used when discussing an exhausting mental situation or stressful time â€” the endurance to bounce back from heartbreak, perhaps.</p></div></div>`;
