It's also a casual way of behaving. Your <i>familiarity</i> with your best friend means that you can say whatever you want around her.</p><p class="long"><i>Familiarity</i> is from the Latin word  <i>familiaritatem</i>  for "intimacy, friendship.” Familiarity is used in situations that people know well. A painter has a familiarity with brushes and canvas. When there’s familiarity with a task, people aren’t stressed, because they’ve done it before. This word also refers to a casual way of acting: if you hug someone, it shows familiarity. That kind of familiarity is the opposite of aloofness and formality.</p></div></div>`;
