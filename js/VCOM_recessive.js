In order to have a trait that is expressed by a <i>recessive</i> gene, such as blue eyes, you must get the gene for blue eyes from both of your parents.</p><p class="long">You might remember the word <i>recessive</i> from biology, where it most often appears. Its opposite is <i>dominant</i> and is always living in its shadow. A recessive allele has to team up with another recessive allele in order to show up. We can also use <i>recessive</i> to describe something that has the tendency to withdraw or recede, or something pertaining to an economic recession.</p></div></div>`;
