Extreme poverty, drought and other dire circumstances can contribute to <i>starvation</i>.</p><p class="long">Starvation can be the result of war or famine, leading to the deaths of large numbers of people. Any organism that depends on food for energy is at risk of starvation when there isn't enough to eat. <i>Starvation</i> is thought by some to have entered the language in 1775 during the American Revolution, when a member of the British Parliament suggested starvation as a way to make the American rebels submit.</p></div>`;
