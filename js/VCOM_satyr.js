As you might guess, <i>satyrs</i> were not known for their mild-mannered ways: Like their patrons, they were excessively fond of women, drink, and song.</p><p class="long">In Greek art, the satyr was depicted as a man with the ears and tail of a horse. Roman artists emphasized this creature's relationship to the goat-god Pan by giving the satyr a goat's ears, horns, and haunches. In both cases, the satyr's animal aspect symbolized his immoderate appetites. This noun can also be used metaphorically for a man whose sexual desire is stronger than his sense of decency.</p></div></div>`;
