If you lie around on the couch all day flipping TV channels, your sister may accuse you of being in a <i>vegetative</i> state.</p><p class="long">Watching television can be a vegetative activity, because certain shows require little thinking on the part of the viewer. Someone describing a <i>vegetative</i> state is either talking about a lazy friend, or — more seriously — a patient whose brain is damaged, leaving him unable to move, speak, or think. The original meanings of the word had more to do with growth than inactivity, but by the late 1800's doctors began using <i>vegetative</i> to describe patients who resembled vegetables rather than moving, thinking humans.</p></div>`;
