When you <i>school</i> someone, it means you’ve educated or put that person in his or her place.</p><p class="long"><i>School</i> has its roots in the Greek <i>skhole</i>. That word originally had the sense of “leisure,” which evolved into a “place for discussion,” so you can see how <i>school</i> came to have its modern meaning. <i>School</i>, as in "school of thought," can describe a group of people bonded together by shared principles. The phrase "school of hard knocks" is slang for “rough experience in life.” <i>School</i> also refers to a large group of fish that swim together.</p></div>`;
