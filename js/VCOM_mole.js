This mole doesn't need much oxygen to breathe and has big paws for digging tunnels. Another type of <i>mole</i> is basically a large, sometimes raised freckle on the skin; a third is a spy, especially a double agent who pretends to work for one country while sending secret information to another. The burrowing type of mole comes from an obsolete English word, <i>moldwarp</i>, or "earth thrower."</p></div>`;
