You can use the word more generally — when you're lost in the woods, you’ll be looking for signs of civilization — lights in the distance and smoke rising from chimneys. <i>Civilization</i> comes from Latin <i>civis,</i> "citizen." If you've got citizens, then you've got government and you're moving right along on the path of human advancement.</p></div></div>`;
