We can use <i>convergence</i> to describe things that are in the process of coming together, like the slow convergence of your opinions with those of your mother, or for things that have already come together, like the convergence of two roads, or for the place where two things already overlap, like the convergence of your aunt's crazy wardrobe with avant-garde fashion.</p></div></div>`;
