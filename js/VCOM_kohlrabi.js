You can eat <i>kohlrabi</i> raw in salads and slaws, or you can cook it.</p><p class="long">Kohlrabi gets its name from the German words for "cabbage" and "turnip," <i>Kohl</i> and <i>RÃ¼be</i>, and that's just what this strange vegetable is, a kind of cabbage-turnip. Sliced and eaten raw, kohlrabi tastes a bit like a slightly spicy radish, but if you roast it in the oven, it takes on a sweet flavor. Kohlrabi is especially popular in Kashmir, India, where it's called <i>ganth ghobi</i> or <i>munj</i>.</p></div></div>`;
