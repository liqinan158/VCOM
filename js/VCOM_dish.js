You need an extra large <i>dish</i> to make a casserole big enough to feed your entire extended family.</p><p class="long">You can use the noun <i>dish</i> to talk about the enamel, ceramic, metal, or plastic vessel your food is in, and you can also use it for the food itself. You might say, "This macaroni and cheese was my great aunt Mathilda's favorite <i>dish</i>." When you serve it, you can say that you "<i>dish</i> it out" â€” although figuratively, this also means "administer punishment."</p></div></div>`;
