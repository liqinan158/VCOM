That could be <i>telepathy</i>, communication that involves none of the known senses.</p><p class="long">Scientists can’t quite figure out if telepathy really is possible, but you can still use the word to describe those times when you seem to know what someone else is thinking. With telepathy, people communicate entirely in the mind without saying anything. If you walk into your favorite coffee shop and without a word the guy at the counter hands you your double latte, that could be telepathy. Or it could be you just order that all the time.</p></div>`;
