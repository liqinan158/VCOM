People who are familiar with red cooked lobsters might be surprised to see that when they're alive they are brown, gray, or even blue.</p><p class="long">Lobsters are large crustaceans, which means they're related to shrimp, crabs, crawfish, and even barnacles. They live and feed on the bottom of the ocean, crawling on their ten legs and eating fish, worms, and sea plants. As a food, lobster is considered a delicacy today â€” although before the mid-19th century, it was thought of as food for poor people and prisoners in coastal New England.</p></div></div>`;
