This overgrowth eventually depletes oxygen in the water, killing off fish and other animal life.</p><p class="long">Most <i>eutrophication</i> is caused by stormwater runoff. When water runs off the soil into lakes and rivers, it carries chemicals and other substances from the ground's surface with it. This can cause water pollution, and it also causes eutrophication. If you've ever seen the surface of a pond covered with bright green algae, you know what eutrophication looks like. This "algae bloom" is caused by the phosphates in detergents, fertilizers, and sewage. The Greek root is <i>eutrophia</i>, "nourish well."</p></div></div>`;
