Racially-motivated crimes can spark riots. A killer might be motivated by jealousy, anger and greed. Being motivated doesn't always lead to crime, though. If you’re one of those rare birds that sticks to New Year’s resolutions, people probably ask, “How do you stay <i>motivated</i>?!” They mean, “How you avoid giving up like the rest of us?”</p></div>`;
