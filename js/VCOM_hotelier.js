If you stay at a hotel, you may never see the <i>hotelier</i>, who is responsible for hiring and managing staff and keeping things running smoothly.</p><p class="long">It's probably more common to use the term "hotel manager," but <i>hotelier</i> is a fancy way to refer to the person in charge of a hotel's operation. If you've got a complaint about your room, you might angrily demand to speak to the hotelier immediately. The word <i>hotelier</i> comes from the French <i>h√¥telier</i>, "hotelkeeper or hotel proprietor," and its Old French root <i>hostel</i>, "a lodging."</p></div></div>`;
