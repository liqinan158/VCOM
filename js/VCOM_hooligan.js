People who start a fight during a sports event are acting like hooligans. In fact, this word is used often for people who start fights at soccer matches, but anyone acting rowdy or obnoxious could be considered a hooligan. Often, hooligans are gang members or criminals. If you see a group of hooligans, itâ€™s probably a good idea to avoid them.</p></div>`;
