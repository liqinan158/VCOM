If you're talking about an aim or purpose, then you want <i>intention</i>. <i>Intension</i> with an "s" should only be used in technical discussions about the meaning of language, or semantics. The <i>intension</i> of the word "dog" is the whole concept of dog-ness that the word brings to mind.</p></div>`;
