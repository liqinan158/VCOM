Any other animal that hatches from an egg is also a <i>hatchling</i>. Since you are human, you are NOT a <i>hatchling</i>.</p><p class="long">While <i>hatchling</i> is most often used for a young bird, newly-born turtles, tadpoles, and newts are all hatchlings too. Sometimes people find bird hatchlings in distress and nurse them back to health. Occasionally, these hatchlings seem to see their human caregivers as parents. <i>Hatchling</i> uses the diminutive <i>-ling</i> suffix, like the words <i>gosling</i> or <i>duckling</i>.</p></div></div>`;
