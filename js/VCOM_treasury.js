Originally, the word literally meant "room for treasure," from the Old French <i>tresor</i>, "hoard or treasure." Starting in the late 1300s, it also meant "department that controls public revenue," which remains the most common use of <i>treasury</i> today. The U.S. even has an official Department of the Treasury, the part of the executive branch that prints money and collects taxes.</p></div></div>`;
