If you keep checking your email to see if you've gotten an important message, you can say you check it <i>continually</i>.</p><p class="long">The adverb <i>continually</i> is good for describing something you do repeatedly, or on a regular basis. Your little brother, for example, might complain continually that he's hungry for ice cream. The word <i>continuously</i> is easy to confuse with <i>continually</i> â€” when you do something continually, you take breaks in between, but when you do it continuously, you don't stop at all. Both come from a Latin root, <i>continuare</i>, or "join together."</p></div>`;
