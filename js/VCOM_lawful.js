var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">lawful</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When something's legal, or the rules allow it, you can call it <i>lawful</i>. It's <i>lawful</i> to plant a tree in your yard, but it's not <i>lawful</i> to dig up a tree in the city park.</p><p class="long">Things that are lawful are allowed or permitted, like driving after you've gotten your drivers license or baking your neighbor a cake. Neither of these things is prohibited by law, so they're lawful. You have a lawful right to build a cabin on land you own, and it's also lawful to put up a fence. The adjective comes from <i>law</i>, which has an Old English root, <i>lagu</i>, "ordinance, rule, regulation, or a district governed by them."</p></div></div>`;
