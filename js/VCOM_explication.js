When you carefully explain your performance art piece to your mystified parents, you can describe what you're doing as an <i>explication</i>.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>explication</i> is closely related to "explicit," which essentially means "crystal clear." Both words come from the Latin <i>explicitus</i>, "unobstructed," which itself is a variant of <i>explicare</i>, "unfold or unravel." A good explication unravels any doubt or confusion and results in a crystal clear understanding, whether the explication involves performance art, the plot of a novel, or the complicated route to your grandmother's house.</p></div></div>`;
