var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">acquainted</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you're <i>acquainted</i> with someone, it means you know each other. If you're taking the city bus and realize that you know several of your fellow riders, you could say, "I'm <i>acquainted</i> with half of the passengers on this bus."</p><p class="long">As long as you know something or someone fairly well, you are acquainted with it, so you can be acquainted with a city, a mathematical idea, or a particular poem. The trickiest thing about the word <i>acquainted</i> is the way it's spelled. Like the words <i>acquit</i> and <i>acquire</i>, you just have to keep in mind that a <i>c</i> needs to go before the <i>qu</i>. After you've spelled it several times, you'll be well acquainted with the correct spelling.</p></div></div>`;
