You might note the <i>frostiness</i> of your lawn one early morning in November and realize you should go back and grab your winter coat. Brrrr!</p><p class="long">The frostiness of a snowy field or a vanilla milkshake is all about their temperature, and specifically about <i>frost</i> â€” the frozen white stuff, made of ice crystals, that forms on something when it's very cold. There's also a figurative type of frostiness, a manner of interacting with others that is aloof, cold, and distant: "His frostiness made me think he wouldn't be a great kindergarten teacher."</p></div>`;
