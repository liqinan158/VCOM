Fancier <i>somersaults</i> are done in the air, rather than on the ground.</p><p class="long">There are many types of somersaultsâ€”forward, backward, and sideways, among other variations. In gymnastics, a somersault on the floor is more often called a <i>roll</i>. The word <i>somersault</i>, which works as a verb too, comes from the now-obsolete French <i>sombresault</i>, from the Latin roots <i>supra</i>, "over," and <i>saut</i>, "a jump."</p></div></div>`;
