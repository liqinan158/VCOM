You're sure to get a <i>rebuke</i> if you forget to do your math homework four days in a row.</p><p class="long">The word <i>rebuke</i> can be a verb, meaning to sternly reprimand or scold, but it can also be a noun, because a <i>rebuke</i> is the result of being scolded. The root comes from the Old French <i>rebuchier</i> and means "to hack down," or "beat back." A rebuke, then, is meant to be critical and to chide â€” in today's terms, a rebuke is verbal smack-down!</p></div></div>`;
