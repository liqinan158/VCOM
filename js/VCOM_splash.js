You might, for example, prefer your coffee with just a <i>splash</i> of cream.</p><p class="long">A splash can be wet, like a splash of lemonade in your tea, or it can be bright, like a splash of yellow across the oil painting you're working on. You can also use <i>splash</i> as a verb, as when you splash your sunbathing brother with swimming pool water. <i>Splash</i> first appeared in the early 1800's as a variation on the word <i>plash</i>, which had the same meanings and is most likely imitative â€” in other words, it sounds like its meaning.</p></div></div>`;
