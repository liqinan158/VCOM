During winter, people jump into the ocean to raise money for a charity.  They don’t stay in there long, and if they did, they’d definitely get hypothermia because the water’s so cold.  The word is a combination of the prefix <i>hypo</i>-, meaning “below,” and the Greek word <i>thermē</i>, translated as “heat.”  When your body heat gets below what it should be, please put on a sweater or you’ll get hypothermia and maybe die.</p></div>`;
