The most common use is when someone — like a teacher — asks a question that no one can answer. That's a case of the teacher stumping the class. Also, politicians traveling through a district, making speeches are stumping, giving what are called stump speeches. Once in a while, to <i>stump</i> means the same thing as two similar words, <i>stomp</i> and <i>stamp</i>. If you're stumping, stomping, and stamping around, you're making a lot of noise with your feet.</p></div>`;
