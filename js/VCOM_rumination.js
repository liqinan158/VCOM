If your grandfather answers every question by saying, "Hmm. Let me think about that," he is a fan of rumination. It comes from the verb <i>ruminate</i>, which means "to think deeply," but also means "to chew the cud." Both words come from the Latin word <i>ruminatus</i>, which has the same meaning and which is rooted in <i>rumen</i>, or "gullet."</p></div>`;
