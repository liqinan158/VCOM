When Europeans first colonized North America, <i>trappers</i> often traded animal furs and skins with Native people.</p><p class="long">When you imagine a trapper, you may think of Davy Crockett and his famous coonskin cap, made from the skin, fur, and entire tail of a trapped raccoon. Today's trappers may dress differently, but they still hunt or capture animals using a variety of traps. Some trappers work removing garden pests like squirrels and groundhogs, while others hunt for food or fur.</p></div>`;
