You could make your plain tote bag more exciting if you <i>bejewel</i> it with shiny sequins and beads.</p><p class="long">You might bejewel a young friend's crown so she'll look more like a queen in her Halloween costume, or you could use a hot glue gun and bejewel some barrettes for your sister, who loves to dress in sparkly gowns. The word <i>bejewel</i> dates from the 1500s, with the <i>jewel</i> part rooted in the Old French word <i>jouel</i>, "ornament," possibly from the Latin <i>jocus</i>, "pastime," or in Vulgar Latin, "that which causes joy."</p></div></div>`;
