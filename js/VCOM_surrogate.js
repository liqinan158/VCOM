If a celebrity leaves her seat to use the restroom in the middle of a big Hollywood awards ceremony, a <i>surrogate</i> will take her place until she returns.</p><p class="long"><i>Surrogate</i> comes from the Latin word <i>surrogare</i>, which means "to put in another's place," or "to substitute." An uncle might refer to his niece as a surrogate child if they are very close, especially if he doesn't have his own biological children. Since 1978, <i>surrogate</i> has also been used to describe a woman who carries and delivers a baby for another person or couple.</p></div>`;
