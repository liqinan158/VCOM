If you want to see some local <i>color</i> in an Irish town, you should head to the pub where all the locals hang out.</p><p class="long">As a verb, <i>color</i> can mean to give bias to something. A bad experience on the first day of school will color how you feel about school for the rest of the year. Another meaning of the verb <i>color</i> is to misrepresent or deceive. If someone colors their telling of a story in which they brought a cat down from a tree, they may make it seem like they rescued two little kids, three kittens and a parrot from a burning building.</p></div></div>`;
