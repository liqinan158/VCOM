Have you've ever heard something that sounded like thunder in a song? That's probably <i>timpani</i>!</p><p class="long">You can also call timpani <i>kettledrums</i>. They're big percussion instruments that can be tuned to specific pitches using a foot pedal, and they're played with soft-headed mallets that professional timpanists usually make themselves. Today's timpani evolved from military drums used during the Civil War. When you're talking about one individual drum, call it a <i>timpano</i>.</p></div></div>`;
