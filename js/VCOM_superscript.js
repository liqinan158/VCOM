When you write out the mathematical expression "x squared," you write the <i>2</i> as a <i>superscript</i>, smaller than and raised above the <i>x</i>, like so: x<sup>2</sup>.</p><p class="long">Superscripts are frequently found in mathematical formulas and as footnotes in academic texts. You'll see a superscript printed smaller and higher than the rest of the text, which makes it stand outâ€”so it's clear what it indicates, as in the case of exponents or footnotes. <i>Superscript</i> comes from the Latin <i>superscriptus</i>, "written above," and the roots <i>super</i>, "above," and <i>scribere</i>, "to write."</p></div>`;
