If you’re not careful, your reckless bike riding could result in a crash that causes <i>injury</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Injury</i> often refers to physical damage, but it can be used more figuratively to describe something that's unjust or that causes harm that isn't physical. For example, your estranged grandfather might do you the injury of leaving you out of his will. The word <i>injury</i> comes from <i>in-</i>, meaning “not,” and the Latin root <i>ius</i> or <i>iur</i>, meaning “right.” So an injury is something that's not right — it's something that has gone wrong that leads to damage.</p></div>`;
