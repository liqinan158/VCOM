Chocolate cream sandwiched with <i>wafers</i> is a delicious treat.</p><p class="long">In addition to a cookie, <i>wafer</i> can also refer to the thin bread used during the Christian ritual of Holy Communion. These wafers are small and round. The word is used for other thin, disc-shaped objects as well, like an electronic wafer, a circular sliver of material that helps form a circuit. But the most common meaning is still the original "thin cake of paste," from a root that <i>wafer</i> shares with <i>waffle</i>.</p></div></div>`;
