On a clear night, the full moon is <i>lucent</i> in the sky.</p><p class="long">The literary word <i>lucent</i> essentially means "luminous" or "radiant," glowing with a soft, bright light. You're most likely to encounter it in a poem or novel, describing the stars or white flowers in the dusk, or someone' s beautiful pale face, but it sometimes has a "clear or lucid" meaning as well. It comes from the Latin <i>lucentem</i>, from <i>lucere</i>, "to shine."</p></div>`;
