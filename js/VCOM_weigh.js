You could <i>weigh</i> the tomatoes you're buying or <i>weigh</i> your options when applying to college.</p><p class="long">To weigh something can mean to physically assess its weight â€” is it 3 pounds? 40 kilos? 22 grams? But it's no accident that the symbol for justice is often a scale. That's because all of the facts of a case need to be weighed or evaluated for justice to be served. And hopefully the decision will be balanced and fair.</p></div></div>`;
