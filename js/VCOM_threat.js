In <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, the huge tornado that spiraled across the Kansas countryside posed a <i>threat</i> to the little girl named Dorothy in its path.</p><p class="long">If a huge thug carrying an equally huge knife approaches you in a dark alley and demands, "Your wallet or your life," you feel the imminent <i>threat</i>. Your safety is at risk, especially if you don't hand over that wallet. <i>Threats</i> don't have to be big and scary, though. An extra-large slice of chocolate cake isn't armed and dangerous, but it's still a serious <i>threat</i> to any dieter who's trying to cut calories. Or, you could see a gray cloud as promising the <i>threat</i> of rain showers.</p></div></div>`;
