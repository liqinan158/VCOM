If you have various interests, you have a lot of them, and they represent a range â€” you might love hip hop, movies from the 1940s, fixing cars, and reading fashion magazines. <i>Various</i> can convey a high number, like when you say, "Various people want to get involved with the park clean-up." This means a lot of people want to help.</p></div></div>`;
