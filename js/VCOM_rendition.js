Whitney Houston's <i>rendition</i> of the Star Spangled Banner is still used at games today; Roseanne Barr's is not.</p><p class="long">This word comes from the Old French <i>rendre</i>, which means “to deliver, yield.” So if you want to put your spin on a song or poem or your favorite movie monologue, go ahead and deliver your rendition of it. But know that in modern times this word has also been used as a noun, describing the secret capture and interrogation of a terror suspect in a foreign country that has less strict human rights laws.</p></div>`;
