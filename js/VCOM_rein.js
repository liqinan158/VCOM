You can use the long strap, or <i>rein,</i> on a horse to control its speed and direction, and you can <i>rein</i> in your own tongue by closing your mouth.</p><p class="long"><i>Rein</i> rhymes with <i>rain</i> but the two words describe very different things. Rain comes down all over the place, uncontrolled, while a rein holds things in place or controls what comes out. As a noun, <i>rein</i> is often used as a plural word "reins" when talking about actual leather restraints used in horse riding, but a rein also is something non-physical like when you put a rein on spending by shopping less.</p></div>`;
