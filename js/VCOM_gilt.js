They're covered in <i>gilt</i> â€” a very thin layer of gold leaf, like paper, applied to the surface.</p><p class="long">A common term associated with <i>gilt</i> is <i>gilt-edged,</i> implying something known to be reliably wealthy. Anything can be gilt-edged: a person, a town, or a reputation. The term comes from a form of government-issued bond, known as a gilt, which was originally gilded around the edges. Don't confuse <i>gilt</i> with <i>guilt,</i> which sounds the same but means a sense of knowing you've done something wrong. (Though, if you've stolen a gilt, does that make you <i>gilty?</i>)</p></div></div>`;
