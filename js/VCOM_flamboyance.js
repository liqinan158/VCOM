You might be awed by the <i>flamboyance</i> of the Elvis impersonator at the talent show, with his glittery, rhinestone-encrusted jumpsuit, aviator sunglasses, and fluffy sideburns.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>flamboyance</i> comes from the French <i>flamboyer</i>, "to flame," and its root word, which means "to shine, flash, or burn." Flamboyance is about extravagance, confidence, and showiness. The flamboyance of the high-kicking Rockettes dancers and male peacocks displaying extravagantly colored tail feathers is the same in its intention to draw attention. That group of flashy pink birds standing on one leg? That's actually known as a <i>flamboyance of flamingos</i>.</p></div>`;
