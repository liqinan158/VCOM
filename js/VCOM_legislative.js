Congress is the <i>legislative</i> branch of the United States government. They're the ones who can pass bills, which the president can sign into law or veto.</p><p class="long">A legislator is someone charged with creating and passing new laws in the legislature. All of these words come from the same root words â€” <i>lex</i> and <i>legis</i> (meaning "law") and <i>lator</i> (meaning "proposer"). So a legislator is literally a proposer of law, and their actions are legislative in nature. If you are interested in the legislative process, you might consider going to law school and running for office. Or you might just enjoy a movie about politics instead.</p></div>`;
