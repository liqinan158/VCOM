If you have the ability to crack everyone up at the dinner table, your mom might say that you should be a <i>comedian</i>.</p><p class="long">Comedians perform in various ways: a stand-up comedian, for example, tells jokes on a stage at a comedy club. Other comedians might perform improvisational comedy routines in a group, or be featured in a funny movie.
