A tent erected <i>haphazardly</i> might look more like a big nylon bag of dirty laundry than a place to sleep.</p><p class="long">Ever heard the expression "I'll hazard a guess?" In it, the word <i>hazard</i> means "chance," as in "take a chance."  Think of the <i>hap</i> in <i>haphazard</i> as short for "happen." Combine <i>hap-</i> and <i>-hazard</i> and you get something that happens (or appears to have happened) by chance. If you approach a math problem with haphazard reasoning, you're likely to get it wrong.</p></div>`;
