It's what you use to relieve yourself after you've drunk way too much lemonade.</p><p class="long">A toilet is the most basic feature of a modern bathroom. You can also use this word for the room that houses it, as in "Excuse me, where is the toilet?" â€” although in the U.S. most people say "bathroom" or "restroom" instead. Another meaning of <i>toilet</i> is "the routine of washing and dressing," and this old-fashioned definition is the original one, from a word meaning "cover or bag for clothes."</p></div>`;
