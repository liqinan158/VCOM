Your <i>hobby</i> may be putting together model train sets and driving your mom crazy from all the noise.</p><p class="long">In the 13th century the word <i>hobby</i> referred to a small horse or a pony. It later came to describe a toy horse — a hobbyhorse. It’s from the hobbyhorse that the word’s modern sense of “favorite pastime” evolved. A hobby is something that you do for fun — not money — and you typically do it fairly regularly. Collecting stamps, growing roses, reading — any of these can be hobbies.</p></div></div>`;
