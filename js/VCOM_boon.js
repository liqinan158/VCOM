"Getting called out of school on the day of the test was a <i>boon</i> for Sam, as he hadn't remembered to study."</p><p class="long"><i>Boon</i> derives from the Old Norse <i>b√≥n</i>, a request for a favor. Think of a boon as a favor that no one has necessarily asked for, something extra. "We'd just spent our last dollar on a cup of coffee so it was a real boon to find a ten dollar bill lying on the sidewalk." <i>Boon</i> can also be an adjective for someone friendly and welcoming, as in "a boon companion."</p></div>`;
