It's the place you live, and the places you love: people might feel at home in a bookstore, a park, or certain cities. Old people live in nursing homes, and baseball players try to reach home plate. Animal shelters find homes for pets. Most people feel safe and happy at home, even if it's not perfect. It’s easy to find somewhere to live, but it’s tough to make a real home.</p></div></div>`;
