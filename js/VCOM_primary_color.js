Combine blue and red and you get purple; mixing yellow and blue gives you green. There are no colors you can combine, however, to get one of the primary colors. When this phrase was first used, around 1610, there were believed to be seven primary colors. Later this was amended to the three that are so familiar to us today.</p></div>`;
