It may be a blow to your <i>self-esteem</i>, for example, to find out you didn't get chosen for the scholarship you applied for.</p><p class="long">The "esteem" part of <i>self-esteem</i> comes from the Latin verb <i>aestimare</i>, meaning to value. The "self" part is self-explanatory, referring to you, yourself. So think of <i>self-esteem</i> as how you value yourself. If you think everything you do is wonderful and deserves praise, you have no self-esteem problems, but if you feel like you are not worthy of good things, you may have low self-esteem.</p></div></div>`;
