If a ship is sinking and you refuse to let anyone else into your 4-person lifeboat, you're extremely <i>selfish</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Selfish</i> combines the pronoun <i>self-</i>, meaning to or for yourself, with the suffix<i>-ish</i>, for "having the character of." So if your actions are selfish, they all have to do with getting something for yourself, like attention, or candy, or power. <i>Selfish</i> is usually meant to be an insult; someone selfish goes beyond just taking care of themselves, and actively takes from others. The opposite of <i>selfish</i> is <i>self-sacrificing</i>, which means, "giving everything to others and sacrificing your own needs."</p></div></div>`;
