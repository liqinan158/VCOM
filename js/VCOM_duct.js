var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">duct</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>duct</i> is a pipe, tube, or tunnel through which water can flow. If there's a leaking <i>duct</i> in your kitchen, you may need to patch it or replace it — in any event, you should probably call a plumber.</p><p class="long">Liquids can move through a duct, and when the duct is in a person's body, like a tear duct or a pancreatic duct, it has the same purpose — tears, for example, flow through tear ducts. Some ducts aid the flow of substances other than liquids, like the air ducts that blow warm air from your furnace into the rooms of your house. <i>Duct tape</i>, often incorrectly called "duck tape," is tape that's used for repairing ducts.</p></div></div>`;
