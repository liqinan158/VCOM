If you try to talk a teacher into changing your grade from a “C” to an “A,” your request will probably be dismissed <i>brusquely</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Brusquely</i> often signifies rudeness; it implies that the action is a little too blunt, direct, or curt. This adverb is basically the opposite of <i>tactfully</i> or <i>gently</i>. A political candidate might brusquely reject the position of his or her opponent, or a baseball coach might brusquely challenge an umpire’s call.</p></div>`;
