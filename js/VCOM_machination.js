No, he uses a <i>machination</i> — a complex plot that relies on numerous elements coming together to work.</p><p class="long">Not surprisingly, <i>machination</i> derives from the Medieval French <i>machina</i>, meaning "machine." And, like many a machine, a machination is subject to going wrong, often comically (see James Bond movies). Politicians love a good machination, and their machinations are frequently exposed in the press as scandals.</p></div></div>`;
