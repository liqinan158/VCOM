If you believe that a famous actor isn't worthy of the attention and praise he gets, you can describe him as <i>undeserving</i>.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>undeserving</i> is perfect for talking about someone who has more than he or she is entitled to. You might believe that your cheating classmate is undeserving of the school prizes she wins, or that greedy bosses are undeserving of their high salaries. The word <i>deserve</i> is at the root of <i>undeserving</i>, and it in turn comes from the Latin <i>deservire</i>, or "serve well." In Late Latin, this came to mean "be entitled to because of good service."</p></div>`;
