A <i>dimly</i> lit dining room might have just one flickering candle, for example.</p><p class="long">Adverbs describe the way something is done, and in the case of <i>dimly</i>, it's almost always used to describe the way something is lit â€” just barely. A dimly illuminated library wouldn't be a great idea, because it would be so difficult to read, but a dimly lit movie theater makes perfect sense. <i>Dimly</i> comes from the adjective <i>dim</i>, whose root is the Old English <i>dimm</i>, "dark or obscure," from Germanic origins.</p></div></div>`;
