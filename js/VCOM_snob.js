Of course maybe he's a <i>snob</i> for looking down on your behavior â€” how annoying!</p><p class="long"><i>Snob</i> has a funny history. It used be slang for "shoemaker," then "common person," and then came to mean "someone who doesn't have a degree from a fancy university," and then it started to mean "people who liked to pretend they have degrees and are generally fancy and look down on common people like shoemakers." Nowadays, <i>snob</i> isn't only for people with false pretentions. Rich people who despise less tasteful folks are snobs, too.</p></div></div>`;
