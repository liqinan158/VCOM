You've promised not to tell, but there's something forcing you to call a friend and spill the beans. This force is <i>compulsion</i>, that urge to do something even though you know you shouldn't.</p><p class="long">If you go back to the Latin, you find <i>compulsus</i>, the past participle of the verb <i>compellere</i>, "to compel." You can see the connection with our word <i>compulsion</i>, which means "something compelling."  The word gained a more psychological meaning in 1909 in a translation of Freudâ€™s studies, suggesting a type of neurosis that impels a person to do things in an obsessive manner.</p></div>`;
