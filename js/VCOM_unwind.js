But when someone says they need to <i>unwind</i>, they mean that they need to relax.</p><p class="long">When you come inside on a cold, snowy day, you might first unwind the scarf from around your neck, loosening and untwisting it. If you then grab a cup of hot chocolate and put your feet up on the coffee table, you’ll feel yourself start to unwind, or become less tense. <i>Unwind</i> has been in use since the fourteenth century, but the figurative meaning of “to relax” dates only from the mid-twentieth century.</p></div>`;
