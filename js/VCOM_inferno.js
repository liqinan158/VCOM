Using <i>inferno</i> to mean "hell" is credited to medieval Italian poet Dante Alighieri. Dante's epic poem the <i>Divine Comedy</i> contains one part titled <i>The Inferno</i>, which tells of a journey through the nine circles of hell full of torture, pain, and imagery of red â€” flames, boiling blood, and so on.</p></div>`;
