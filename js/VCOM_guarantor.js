Sometimes you also need a <i>guarantor</i> to rent an apartment.</p><p class="long">If you're young, don't have a regular job, have a bad credit score, or don't have much money in the bank, you may need a guarantor in order to get a loan from a bank. The job of the guarantor is to <i>guarantee</i> that the loan payments will be made â€” by them, if necessary. You can also use this word for people who make other guarantees: "The health department is a guarantor of food safety in our city's restaurants."</p></div></div>`;
