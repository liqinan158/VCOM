To be averse to something is to shun it,  turn away from it, or dislike it.  Some people are averse to the use of cilantro in any food that comes near them, some others are averse to wearing itchy wool sweaters, and others are averse to any form of exercise.  Aversions are really very personal.</p></div></div>`;
