The word <i>spelt</i> is as ancient as the grain itself, going back to Proto-Indo-European language and the word <i>spel</i>, meaning "to split or break off," possibly because of the way spelt husks split during threshing. <i>Spelt</i> is also the past tense of <i>spell</i> in British English, while in the United States, people tend to go with <i>spelled</i>, unless they're talking about non-wheat bagels.</p></div>`;
