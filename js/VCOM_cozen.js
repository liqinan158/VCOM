If someone asks why you lied, you might say "Cuz I didn't want you to know the truth." And to <i>cozen</i> is to keep the truth hidden and deceive or cheat. Using a trick to get something is one way to cozen, and if you tell a partial truth, there's still a part lie or an attempt to cozen and mislead.</p></div></div>`;
