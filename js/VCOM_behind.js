Your shy dog might tend to stand <i>behind</i> you when you meet a friend on your walk.</p><p class="long">When the sun hides behind a cloud, the cloud is in front of it, and when there's fear lurking behind your cheerful smile, the grin is disguising, or covering, your anxiety. <i>Behind</i> can also mean "supporting," as when you're a hundred percent behind your sister's campaign for school president; or "lagging," as when you say: "Slow down! I'm way <i>behind</i> in this race!" Finally, <i>behind</i> is a gentle slang term for "buttocks."</p></div></div>`;
