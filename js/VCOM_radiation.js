The first thing you think of as <i>radiation</i> is probably X-rays, but what cooks your food in the microwave oven is also <i>radiation</i>.</p><p class="long">Radiation has some important medical uses, especially in the treatment of cancer, as "<i>radiation</i> therapy." It’s also associated with such horrors as "<i>radiation</i> sickness" — observed in people exposed to high levels of radiation, as in the aftermath of the 1986 explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, in the Ukraine.  You can also use the word <i>radiation</i>, in more benign contexts, to describe something spreading out from a central point, as the radiation of warmth from your fireplace.</p></div></div>`;
