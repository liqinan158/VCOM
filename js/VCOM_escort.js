Some <i>escorts</i> are there to protect you, some just to share a good time.</p><p class="long">The word <i>escort</i> can be a noun or a verb — "your escort escorts you." This word is derived from the Latin <i>excorrigere</i>, "to set out," and moved through the Italian <i>scorgere</i>, meaning "to guide." In the 1570s it took on a military tone as <i>escorte</i>, used to describe armed protectors for travelers. In the 19th century it came to mean "accompanying a person on social occasions," although we still refer to military <i>escorts</i> today.</p></div></div>`;
