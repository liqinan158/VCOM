Before you let your <i>fury</i> get the best of you, it's good to take a few deep breaths before you speak.</p><p class="long">Fury is anger times ten — it's unrestrained and maybe a little scary. If you've ever seen a little kid have a raging temper tantrum because it was time to leave the park, you have an idea of what fury looks — and sounds — like. Fury can also describe aspects of nature, like the fury of a hurricane. In Greek mythology, a fury was a spirit of punishment, named for the three Furies, goddesses who punished the guilty.</p></div></div>`;
