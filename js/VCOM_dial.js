If you have a watch that glows in the dark, it's the <i>dial</i> you can see even in a dark movie theater.</p><p class="long">Old telephones and televisions both have dials â€” the first has numbers from zero to nine in a circle, and the latter has a round disc for changing channels. When you call someone, you can say that you <i>dial</i> their number. In fact, people tend to use the word <i>dial</i> when they use a phone, even if they're pushing buttons or tapping a touch screen. The Latin root is <i>dialis</i>, "daily," and the earliest dial was a sundial.</p></div></div>`;
