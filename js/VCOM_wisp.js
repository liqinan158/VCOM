Even after you put out a campfire, there may be little <i>wisps</i> of smoke in the air above it.</p><p class="long">Tiny pieces of hair escaping your ponytail are wisps, and tufts of clouds or fog are also wisps. A more figurative kind of wisp, like a wisp of memory or sadness, is just the barest snippet of emotion. A wisp of a child is a tiny girl or boy, and a wisp of hay is used to dry a horse â€” this is actually the original, 14th century meaning of <i>wisp</i>, related to the Swedish <i>visp</i>, "bundle of hay."</p></div>`;
