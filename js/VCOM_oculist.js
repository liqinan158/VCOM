This was a doctor who dealt with eye disorders.</p><p class="long">The root word, <i>oculus</i>, is Latin for “eye.” <i>Oculist</i> is actually a rather out-dated and old-fashioned term. Now, the more popular names for these kinds of doctors are <i>ophthalmologist</i> and <i>optometrist</i>. Ophthalmologists deal with more serious problems and diseases. Optometrists address less serious issues, perform vision tests, and prescribe corrective lenses.</p></div></div>`;
