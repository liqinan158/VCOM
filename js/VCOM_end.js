After your cat unwinds a ball of yarn, you may find one <i>end</i> of it in your kitchen and the other <i>end</i> upstairs in the bathroom.</p><p class="long">A piece of string has two ends, while stories, races, and years have just one end each. When you buy a length of fabric, the leftover bit is an end, and the final point of almost anything — a play or a marriage — is also an end. When you end something, you make it conclude. In football, an "<i>end</i> zone" is the far side of the field, and a "defensive <i>end</i>" is a player near the sideline.</p></div></div>`;
