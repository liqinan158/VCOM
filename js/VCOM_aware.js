If you're <i>aware</i> of a sled zooming towards you, move! And if you’re <i>aware</i> that the other kids wish they had sleds, share yours. That’s being socially <i>aware</i>. Well done.</p><p class="long"><i>Aware</i> is a close relative of <i>beware</i>, "look out for." Julius Caesar is famously warned to "beware the ides of March." Too bad he's not aware of why. <i>Beware</i> and <i>aware</i> share the root <i>ware</i>, from an Old English word meaning "careful." Be aware of your purse at all times, and beware of the snatch-and-grab thief.</p></div>`;
