A homeless person might dress in tatters, and a serious hiker might wear a pair of socks until they're just tatters, then throw them away and put on a new pair. <i>Tatter</i> comes from an earlier word, <i>tatrys</i>, "slashed garments," which has a Scandinavian root and is related to words like the Old Norse <i>t√∂turr</i>, "rags."</p></div>`;
