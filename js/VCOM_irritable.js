Did I say something wrong?</p><p class="long"><i>Irritable</i> means "easy to irritate or bother." If you have irritable skin, you get a rash from just about anything. An irritable person is not easy-going and often not very easy to be around.  You might feel like you're "walking on eggshells," or being extra careful not to upset your brother when he's in an irritable mood.  Is there anything I can do to make you less irritable?  Fetch your favorite blanket?  Maybe I'll just go away now.</p></div></div>`;
