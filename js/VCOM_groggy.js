When you first wake up, you might be <i>groggy</i> until you get up and start moving around.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>groggy</i> comes from the noun <i>grog</i>, which was what the sailors back in the 1700’s called rum diluted with water. Today, <i>grog</i> is slang for any liquor. To feel groggy is to feel drunk, tipsy, weak or dazed. Boxers who’ve sustained numerous blows to the head can get pretty groggy, and they might stagger around the ring — a sign that they are feeling out of it.</p></div>`;
