Many delicious foods are made even more delicious with melted <i>cheese</i>, including pizza and nachos.</p><p class="long">Cheese is made from the milk of cows, goats, sheep, or buffalo, and it's acidified before the solids are separated and pressed. There are many kinds of cheese, ranging from soft, spreadable cream cheese to hard parmesan. An old fashioned meaning of <i>cheese</i> is "stop" â€” you might say, "<i>Cheese</i> it!" This comes from 1800s thieves' slang, while the instruction a photographer gives, "Say <i>cheese</i>!" dates from the early 20th century.</p></div>`;
