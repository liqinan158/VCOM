You've probably seen <i>skittish</i> horses in parades — the loud noises and crowds of people make them very nervous and jumpy.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>skittish</i> isn't just for animals — humans can be <i>skittish</i> too. If you're sleeping in a haunted house, for example, you're likely to be skittish, jumping at every moving shadow. <i>Skittish</i> can also mean flighty in thought — like your boss who's <i>skittish</i> about giving you a raise and avoids discussing it. The word is thought to have come from the Scandinavian word <i>skyt</i>, meaning "very lively, frivolous."</p></div></div>`;
