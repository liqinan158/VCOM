Temper tantrums, whining, and even hitting are all <i>normative</i> behaviors — if you're three. If you're thirty, you might have a problem.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>normative</i> can also mean prescribing rules or standards. The U.S. government's normative rules for living in American society mean that you have freedom of speech, for example, but you don't have the right to slander or libel someone. The words "norm" and "normal" are related to <i>normative</i>, which comes from the French <i>normatif</i>, which itself is from the Latin word <i>norma</i>, "a carpenter's square."</p></div></div>`;
