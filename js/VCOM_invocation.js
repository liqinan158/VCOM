var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">invocation</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">An <i>invocation</i> is an appeal to a higher power for help, such as a prayer for serenity or a plea to the rain gods during a drought.</p><p class="long">An <i>invocation</i> often refers to an appeal to something not of this world, such as a god or a spirit, but it can involve an appeal to any higher power, even one that is flesh and blood. During a close basketball game, for example, you may mutter an <i>invocation</i> to the former NBA star Michael Jordan asking that your team’s star player somehow gain the power to hit his jump shots. The word <i>invocation</i> can also be used in the sense of invoking a notable authority to support a position. If you say, “But my mom said I should never wear cheap clothing,” for example, that is an <i>invocation</i> of your mom in support of your desire to buy designer jeans.</p></div>`;
