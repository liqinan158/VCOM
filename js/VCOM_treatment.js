Hopefully you get the royal <i>treatment</i> when you choose the deluxe pedicure <i>treatment</i>!</p><p class="long">You know how some people treat you with respect but others don't treat you so nicely? You can refer to how people act toward you as treatment. If a restaurant is known for rude treatment of customers, people will stop going there. Doctors also use the word <i>treatment</i> when they discuss a particular medical course of action â€” such as chemotherapy as a treatment for cancer. The root word is the Latin <i>tractare</i>, which originally meant "drag about," but came to mean "manage, handle, or deal with."</p></div>`;
