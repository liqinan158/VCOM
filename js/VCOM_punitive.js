If someone takes <i>punitive</i> action against you, you'll probably whine and complain — you're in trouble and you're about to get punished.</p><p class="long">An easy way to remember the meaning of <i>punitive</i> is that it looks like the word <i>punish</i> — both come from the Latin root word <i>punire</i>, "to inflict a penalty on." <i>Punitive</i> doesn't always refer to a person-to-person punishment, like a mom disciplining a child. It can also describe the unpleasant result of an action on a large scale, like the punitive effect higher taxes will have on the middle class.</p></div>`;
