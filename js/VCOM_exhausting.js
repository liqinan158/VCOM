An <i>exhausting</i> hike up the side of a mountain leaves you gasping for breath and so tired you need to sit down and rest.</p><p class="long">Some things, like a rigorous workout or a difficult type of manual labor, are physically exhausting. Others are mentally exhausting, like a long argument with a friend or a tricky calculus exam. The adjective <i>exhausting</i> is rooted in the Latin <i>exhaurire</i>, "draw off, take away, use up, or empty," which perfectly describes how you feel after an exhausting experience.</p></div>`;
