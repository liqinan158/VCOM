Acrobats and other performers often ride unicycles and sometimes even do tricks like balancing on a tightrope while perched on the seat of a unicycle. The Latin prefix <i>uni</i> gives you a clue about the meaning of this word, since it means "one." In <i>unicycle</i>, it's combined with "cycle," which comes from the Greek word <i>kyklos</i>, "circle or wheel."</p></div></div>`;
