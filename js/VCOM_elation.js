It has a sense of rising or expanding, even to the point of light-headedness. To help remember it, think of the (unrelated) word <i>inflation</i>, which has a similar sound. When you inflate a tire, you pump it up. When you are filled with elation, you are also, in a sense, "pumped up."</p></div></div>`;
