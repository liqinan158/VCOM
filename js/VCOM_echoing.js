The <i>echoing</i> halls of a large building seem full of repeating, reflected sounds.</p><p class="long">An echoing cathedral might resound with the notes sung by a choir, and a creepy haunted house could be echoing too, with mysterious bumps and groans. The adjective <i>echoing</i> comes from the noun <i>echo</i>, a "sound repeated by reflection," which is rooted in the mythical Greek figure of <i>Echo</i>. a nymph who pined for love until only her voice was left, echoing through the mountains.</p></div></div>`;
