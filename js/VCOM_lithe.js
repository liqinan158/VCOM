Those people are, in a word, <i>lithe</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Lithe</i> comes to us from Old English and originally meant "mild, meek." As a meek person bends to the will of others, the meaning of <i>lithe</i> has broadened to flexible and even graceful. Think of a dancer or the ease of a sleek cat when you think of <i>lithe</i>. You can use it to describe a person or the way someone moves.</p></div></div>`;
