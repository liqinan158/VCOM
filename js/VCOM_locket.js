Your grandmother's silver <i>locket</i> might not be worth a lot of money, but it probably has a lot of sentimental value to you.</p><p class="long">Lockets are usually round, oval, or heart-shaped, snapping open and closed and containing a picture of a loved one or a favorite pet, or — in the old days — a lock of someone's hair. These little cases aren't named for hair locks, though, but instead get their name from the Old French <i>loquet</i>, "door-handle" or "latch," for the way their covers move on a hinge and close securely, like a door.</p></div></div>`;
