var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">wrangle</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>wrangle</i> is to take part in a long, angry, intense argument, especially over an issue with lots of details. You can also <i>wrangle</i>, or herd, a bunch of cows. Politicians and lawyers frequently <i>wrangle</i>, no cows necessary.</p><p class="long"><i>Wrangle</i> in its current meaning comes from the nineteenth century American term <i>wrangling</i>, the art of herding cattle, probably with the idea in mind that rounding up those tiresome details is a bit like rounding up all those tiresome cattle; they tend to go flying off in all directions. From <i>wrangler</i> in the cowboy sense we get Wrangler jeans, though not all wranglers wear Wranglers of course.</p></div>`;
