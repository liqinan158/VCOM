Sometimes there are <i>newsstands</i> in train stations, so you don’t have to just stand there and wait, you can read the news!</p><p class="long">The word <i>newsstand</i> is basically <i>news</i> and <i>stand</i> smushed together. Sometimes you still see it hyphenated, as in <i>news-stand</i>, but they’ve been together long enough to ditch the hyphen. It is exactly what it sounds like — a stand that sells news. A newsstand is usually a booth on a busy corner, in building lobby, or anywhere people might like to buy something to read. It’s a good word for hangman because there are two <i>s</i>’s in the middle.</p></div>`;
