If you were to surveil someone, you'd keep a close eye on them, monitoring everything they do. These days, that means keeping track of their online activity as well as their phone calls and physical movement. It's usually authority and governmental figures doing the surveillance â€” although if a company wants to sell you something, they just might surveil your internet history.</p></div></div>`;
