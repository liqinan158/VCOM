var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">biannual</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use <i>biannual</i> to describe something that happens two times a year. Cleaning out the garage may be a <i>biannual</i> project in your household, or your dentist might insist on <i>biannual</i> check-ups.</p><p class="long">When you break apart the word <i>biannual</i>, it’s easy to remember what it means. The prefix <i>bi-</i>, meaning “two,” tips you off that this is something that happens twice. And you’re probably already familiar with <i>annual</i>, which describes something that happens once a year. Put it together and you have <i>biannual</i>: twice a year. Whether you’re describing formal events or the frequency of your haircuts, you can use <i>biannual</i> anytime you need to say that something happens twice a year.</p></div>`;
