Often the word is used more loosely. You might buy a lot of clothes because you're a slave to the latest fashion trends. You could spend all day in the kitchen, preparing 12 casseroles, working like a <i>slave</i>. That kind of exaggeration is common, but don't kid yourself: nothing is really similar to — or as horrible as — being a slave.</p></div>`;
