var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">irreproachable</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the adjective <i>irreproachable</i> to describe something or someone blameless or not deserving of criticism. It can be annoying, but your parents strive to give you <i>irreproachable</i> advice when they tell you, "Study hard in school," and not "Party on!"</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>irreproachable</i> comes from the Old French word <i>reprocher</i>, which meant "to blame." With the addition of the prefix <i>ir-</i>, meaning "not," and the suffix <i>-able</i>, meaning "capable," we get the English meaning of "not capable of being blamed." It is the rare politician who has an irreproachable reputation. So if your background is not irreproachable and you run for office, be prepared for the press to dig up all the skeletons in your closet.</p></div>`;
