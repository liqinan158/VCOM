It's a mark that looks like two dots over a letter, and it signifies a shift in pronunciation.</p><p class="long">Properly speaking, only German and Hungarian words have these two dots over a vowel to indicate a change in sound (as in <i>doppelgänger</i> and <i>über</i>), but loosely, people sometimes refer to its twin, the dieresis (as in <i>naïve</i>) as an umlaut. The word is German and means "change of sound," from <i>um</i>, "about," and <i>laut</i>, "sound."</p></div>`;
