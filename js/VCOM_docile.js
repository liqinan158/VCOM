A docile student is willing to be taught.  A docile animal is easy to handle. If you behave well and do what people tell you to do, you're a docile person. <i>Docile</i> might be a word of praise, but it can also be a criticism of someone for being overly submissive. Some synonyms are <i>amenable</i> and <i>compliant</i>.</p></div>`;
