If you're golfing and dark gray clouds <i>ominously</i> appear, you'd better call it a day.</p><p class="long">Originating from the Latin word <i>ominosus,</i> meaning "full of foreboding," the adverb <i>ominously</i> indicates when an action is done in an ominous manner, possibly indicating danger or evil is in the future. You might want to reconsider that moonlit hike if a wolf ominously howls just as you are about to begin. If gigantic waves are ominously crashing into the shore, it would be wise to devote the day to building a sand castle rather than snorkeling.</p></div></div>`;
