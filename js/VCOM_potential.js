Companies try to reach <i>potential</i> customers through advertising.</p><p class="long"><i>Potential</i>, from the Latin <i>potentia</i> "power," sounds more complicated than it is. It describes something or someone that has the power to become something. A potential success is not yet a success but could be if circumstances are right. When a situation has the potential for disaster, it could turn bad easily. You have potential if you have a natural but undeveloped ability to do something and a building with potential will be really nice once it's fixed up.</p></div></div>`;
