Anthropologists sometimes study <i>pygmy</i> groups.</p><p class="long">The term <i>pygmy</i>, while still used by many who study and write about world cultures and groups, it is somewhat old fashioned and can be offensive to members of these cultures. Anthropologists often refer to groups in which men are on average shorter than four feet eleven inches tall as pygmies, though for the most part these people prefer to be known by their ethnicity. <i>Pygmy</i> comes from the Greek word <i>pugmaios</i>, or "dwarf."</p></div>`;
