Your <i>vivacity</i> makes you a great comedic actor because you attack the stage with endless energy.</p><p class="long"><i>Vivacity</i> comes from the Latin <i>vīvācitāt-</i>, meaning "life force," and shares a root with the word <i>vital</i>. You may know from medical dramas that if someone's vital signs are not good, that means he's dying. But if he is full of vivacity, that means the opposite: he's totally energetically fully alive! If you don't have much vivacity, don't become a motivational speaker.</p></div></div>`;
