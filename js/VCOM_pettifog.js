If you and your brother <i>pettifog</i> over who gets to sit in the front seat when your mom offers a ride to school, you may both end up taking the bus instead.</p><p class="long">If you're looking for a colorful, old-fashioned way to say "quibble" or "squabble," <i>pettifog</i> is the word for you. It shares a root with petty, or "trivial," but otherwise its origin is a bit hazy. Experts see a connection to <i>pettifactor</i>, "legal agent who undertakes small cases." And a <i>pettifogger</i>, rather than a quibbler, is a sneaky lawyer, or one who "deals with petty cases."</p></div>`;
