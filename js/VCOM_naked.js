When piles of snow melt in the spring, they leave naked fields and sidewalks. If your white walls don't have any pictures or mirrors hanging on them, they'll look naked too. If you don't try to hide your sorrow, you'll show naked emotio. And, finally, to see without the aid of glasses or a microscope is called using "the <i>naked</i> eye."</p></div></div>`;
