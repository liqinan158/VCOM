When a person is <i>unctuous</i>, you can't trust their kindness, because they usually want something in return.</p><p class="long">Interestingly, <i>unctuous</i> is derived from the Latin <i>unctus</i> which means "anointed with oil," which is where the <i>oily</i> connotation comes from. <i>Unctuous</i> and <i>oily</i> are synonyms that both suggest that someone is trying to butter you up; they're being nice, because they're hoping you'll give them what they want. Talk-show hosts, used-car salesmen, people who want your job: all of these are people we think of (rightly or wrongly) as being unctuous. Being an unctuous jerk, he gave me a gift, hoping I'd give him a record deal.</p></div></div>`;
