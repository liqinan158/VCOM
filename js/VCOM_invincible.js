Disease, death, destruction? No match for something truly <i>invincible.</i> Mere humans who imagine they're <i>invincible</i>, however, will inevitably prove that they're not.</p><p class="long"><i>Invincible</i> comes ultimately from the Latin verb <i>vincere,</i> "to conquer." Many of the uses for <i>invincible</i> are for describing someone or something victorious or unbeatable at what they do. A company can be invincible when it outsells similar businesses for years, a tennis player is invincible after winning all of the majors in a year or a career, and Superman and the Indomitable Snowman are invincible as long as they stay away from kryptonite and the warm sun.</p></div>`;
