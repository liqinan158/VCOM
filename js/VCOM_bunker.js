(Be sure to stock up on canned food.)</p><p class="long">If you talk about a bunker today, most people assume you mean a shelter that's used during war, like a foxhole, or a safe underground or recessed place. Golfers will think you mean an obstacle on a golf course, a depression that's filled with sand. Another kind of bunker is a compartment that's used to store fuel on large ships  â€” the oil itself is known as bunker fuel. The original fuel bunkers held coal, but today they typically contain oil. <i>Bunker</i> comes from a Scottish word for "bench."</p></div></div>`;
