So think twice about that <i>gaudy</i> rainbow-colored suit and shiny gold shoes ensemble.</p><p class="long"><i>Gaudy</i> is an adjective that means "ostentatious" — in other words, flashy and in your face, and not in a good way. Someone in a gaudy outfit is probably trying too hard to be cool and stylish. <i>Gaudy</i> evolved from the Middle English <i>gaud</i> “deception, trick” in the 1520’s. That word, in turn, came from <i>gaudi</i>, used to describe a “large, ornamental bead in a rosary.”</p></div>`;
