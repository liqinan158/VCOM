If you warp the <i>chassis</i> of your mom’s car when you make a Dukes of Hazzard jump, she's going to be mad. Pronounce <i>chassis</i> CHASS-ee (singular) and CHASS-eez (plural).</p><p class="long"><i>Chassis</i> comes from the Latin <i>capsa,</i> meaning box. In the 1600s, <i>chassis</i> referred to window frames, and starting with early automobile production, acquired its dominant meaning, i.e., the box that is the frame for the car. It also means other kinds of frame/boxes too — if you have a radio or a stereo, the outside box is called a chassis.</p></div></div>`;
