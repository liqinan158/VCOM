A doctor should be au fait with medical advances. A quarterback should be au fait with different team’s defenses. This word has to do with current knowledge. If you haven’t watch a TV show for years, you’re not au fait with it. Being au fait is like being abreast, au courant, or up on.</p></div></div>`;
