Public speakers and announcers commonly use the phrase "<i>ladies</i> and gentlemen" to address a group of men and women, and if you're meeting a noblewoman, she may very well expect to be called "<i>Lady</i> Gertrude." Sometimes, ironically, <i>lady</i> is used in a rough, rude way: "Hey <i>lady</i>, out of my way!"</p></div></div>`;
