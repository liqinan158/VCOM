Revolutions are all about obtaining <i>independence,</i> most famously perhaps the Revolutionary War in America, which led to America's freedom from Britain.</p><p class="long"><i>Independence</i> comes from a nice medieval French word, <i>depenre</i>, meaning "to hang from," or "to hang down." The <i>in</i> at the beginning is Latin for "not," so the word originally meant "not hanging from," which is a neat description of what countries achieve by throwing off their colonizers. Teenagers also commonly seek independence from their parents â€” but perhaps not financial independence.</p></div>`;
