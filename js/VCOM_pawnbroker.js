If you want to hock your engagement ring, head to a <i>pawnbroker</i>!</p><p class="long">If you pawn your bike at a pawnbroker's shop (also called a <i>pawnshop</i>), you will leave with cash, but not quite as much as your bike is worth. To get it back, you'll have to pay back the money plus interest â€” and if you don't, the pawnbroker will eventually sell your bike to someone else. To <i>pawn</i> is to "give an object as security in exchange for money," and a <i>broker</i> is a "seller of other people's goods."</p></div>`;
