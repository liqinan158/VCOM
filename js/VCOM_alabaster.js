In museums, you're likely to see statues and vases carved from <i>alabaster</i>.</p><p class="long">The root of <i>alabaster</i> is a Greek word meaning "perfume vase," <i>alabastros</i>. You'll also find ancient tomb carvings, windows in medieval cathedrals, and Egyptian sarcophagi made of alabaster. Alabaster is usually white, and because it is translucent, seems lit from within. For this reason, it often describes a pale complexion that seems to glow from the inside.</p></div></div>`;
