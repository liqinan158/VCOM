If you've ever had a very high fever, you might have experienced seeing a <i>phantasmagoria</i> of strange images in your half-awake, feverish state.</p><p class="long">The strange, hallucinatory images you might see in a dream are a phantasmagoria. Even when you're awake, if you see odd or fantastic things — either real or imagined — they're a phantasmagoria. The word was invented by a French dramatist in 1801, who used the Greek word for "image," <i>phantasma</i> to make the French word <i>phantasmagorie</i>. The word referred to a "magic lantern" show, which in the 1800s was a popular display of projected images.</p></div>`;
