When making beef stew, the color and flavor are usually better if you <i>sear</i> the meat first.</p><p class="long"><i>Sear</i> comes from the Old English word <i>searian</i> which meant “dry up” or “wither.”  Typically, the verb <i>sear</i> now refers to burning or scorching something with heat, but if you see the phrase “wind-seared,” it means that a place — or something left in that place — has been withered by exposure to the elements. An unpleasant image can be seared into your memory, meaning you can't forget it.</p></div>`;
