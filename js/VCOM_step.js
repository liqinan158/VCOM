When you lift up your foot, move it forward, and put it down, that's a <i>step</i>. You can call the distance you cover in that single movement a <i>step</i> as well.</p><p class="long">Each movement in a dance is a step, and so is the sound of feet on the floor: "I heard his heavy step when he went for his midnight snack." A step is also a stair or a  ladder's rung, and when you achieve something or make progress, you take steps toward your goal. If you're about to step in gum, your friend might warn, "Watch your step!"</p></div></div>`;
