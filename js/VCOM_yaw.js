On a sailboat, an unexpected <i>yaw</i> can make you lurch to one side â€” and it might also make you seasick.</p><p class="long">Both as a noun and a verb, <i>yaw</i> basically means "swerve or twist." It's most common for this word to be used in discussions of a vehicle's movement, especially ships, airplanes, and spacecraft. A pilot might describe a jet that tends to yaw to the right, while a boat captain might warn her crew that an approaching storm will cause the ship to pitch and yaw. Etymologists believe that <i>yaw</i> and <i>yacht</i> share a root.</p></div></div>`;
