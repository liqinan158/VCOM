After a day at the beach, you might come home with <i>gritty</i> arms and legs.</p><p class="long">A baking project involving corn meal might result in a gritty counter and a gritty kitchen floor, and one shake of your dirty dog will leave you with a gritty couch. <i>Grit</i> is a tiny particle of sand or stone, and <i>gritty</i> means "covered in grit." A second meaning of <i>gritty</i> is "showing bravery and spirit." When you stick with something no matter how scary or difficult it is, that's gritty.</p></div></div>`;
