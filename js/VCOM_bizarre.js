var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">bizarre</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Someone or something <i>bizarre</i> is odd or unusual in appearance, style, or character. If your teacher walks into class wearing a purple boa, lime-green cowboy boots, and a scuba mask, you might comment, "How <i>bizarre</i>!"</p><p class="long">Things that are bizarre often involve strange contrasts or unexpected elements. <i>Bizarre</i> was borrowed from French, from <i>bizarro</i> "angry, fierce, strange," from Spanish, "bold, like a knight." The Spanish word was probably influenced by Basque <i>bizar</i> "a beard," since beards were taken as signs of energy and spirit. Nowadays it takes more than a beard to get you labeled as <i>bizarre</i>. Unpredictable behavior is often called bizarre â€” like when your little brother decides that he will communicate only in Pig Latin.</p></div>`;
