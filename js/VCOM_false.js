If you spread <i>false</i> rumors about a friend, you're telling lies.</p><p class="long">When you read a fact in a textbook that you know is mistaken, you can describe it as <i>false</i>. Giving someone a false impression about your family's pizza place — implying that it's a fancy restaurant when it's really a take-out counter and a pizza oven — means you're giving the wrong idea. <i>False</i> can also mean "fake," as in false eyelashes or a false smile. It comes from the Old French <i>fals</i>, which is <i>faux</i> in Modern French: "false,fake, incorrect, or mistaken."</p></div>`;
