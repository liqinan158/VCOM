However, beware because that flattery may come with the underlying intention of persuading you to do something!</p><p class="long">The noun <i>blandishment</i> is related to the old-fashioned verb <i>blandish</i> meaning "to coax with flattery, or kind words." A blandishment is often teasing in tone, and the intention to persuade is usually thinly veiled. Your brother may use a blandishment or two to get you to do his chores, and you're going to know exactly what he's after. But the saying "You get more flies with honey" just might hold true if you find yourself taking out the trash when it's not your turn.</p></div>`;
