Hopefully you've washed them.</p><p class="long">A dresser or a chest of drawers can also be called a <i>bureau</i>, a piece of furniture with drawers for storing things. Another meaning of <i>bureau</i> is "an office or government agency." These two definitions seem unrelated, but the original meaning of the French word <i>bureau</i>, "cloth covering for a desk" helps explain. <i>Bureau</i> gradually evolved to mean first just "desk" (and eventually "dresser"), and around 1720 it also started being used to mean a room full of desks, or an office.</p></div></div>`;
