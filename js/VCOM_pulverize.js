When something is turned into dust, often it becomes useless. That's why <i>pulverize</i> can also mean "to destroy or demolish." Construction crews pulverize a building using wrecking balls and sometimes even explosives. The materials left behind are broken into such small parts that they can't be salvaged for other uses.</p></div>`;
