var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">amorphous</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Amorphous</i> means without a clearly defined form, like the moon's <i>amorphous</i> reflection in a lake. Figuratively, something <i>amorphous</i> lacks focus, be it a work of art, a political movement, or even someone's life plans.</p><p class="long">The Greek roots of this word are clear: <i> morphÄ“</i> means "form," and <i>a-</i> means "lacking or without." When creative works or ideas are described as amorphous, it means they suffer from a lack of organization. An amorphous object lacks a well-defined outline or structure, like amorphous jellyfish drifting on the surface of the ocean.  And scientifically, this adjective simply describes something without a crystalline form, like an amorphous metal or amorphous ice.</p></div>`;
