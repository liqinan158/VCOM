If you're hungry, you might have time to grab a snack during the <i>intermission</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>intermission</i> has a Latin root, <i>intermissionem</i>, "a breaking off or interruption." Originally, it meant any temporary pause, but by the 1850s it was often used in reference to breaks between acts in theatrical performances. In the UK, this is known as an "interval," but in North America, theater and concert attendees wait until the intermission to use the restroom.</p></div></div>`;
