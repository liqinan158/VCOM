In short, you react to an action, statement, or emotion by mirroring it.</p><p class="long">This one comes from the Latin verb <i>reciprocare</i>, meaning to move back and forth. Its root makes it sound as if <i>reciprocate</i> implies only a physical action, but it's also used for the less tangible. If you fail to pay the rent, your landlord might <i>reciprocate</i> by evicting you. If your crush acts like he doesn't know you exist when you pass him in the halls, it's probably safe to say he does not <i>reciprocate</i> your amorous feelings.</p></div></div>`;
