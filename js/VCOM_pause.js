Teachers, for example, often pause after making an important point to check that students understand and to give them time to ask questions. <i>Pause</i> which rhymes with <i>laws</i> and <i>cause</i>, comes from the Greek word <i>pausis</i>, "stopping, ceasing," which comes from <i>pauein</i> "to stop, to cause to cease." Why don't you pause and think about that for a moment.</p></div>`;
