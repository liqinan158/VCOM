It’s a type of high status or distinction for anything considered to be the best at something, like the <i>preeminence</i> of gold or the <i>preeminence</i> of a famous musician.</p><p class="long"><i>Preeminence</i> (or <i>pre-eminence</i> if you love hyphens) comes from the Latin word <i>praeeminere</i> for to “rise above or excel.” People with preeminence include the President, billionaires, and great athletes such as Michael Jordan. By definition, <i>preeiminence</i> suggests superiority, so it can't be a quality lots of people have. A world-famous surgeon is a doctor with preeminence. Anyone considered wealthy, powerful, important, or famous has preeminence.</p></div></div>`;
