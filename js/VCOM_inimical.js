So, most teenagers would argue, are curfews. To be <i>inimical</i> is to be harmful, antagonistic, or opposed to something.</p><p class="long"><i>Inimical</i> comes from the Latin word <i>inimicus</i>, meaning "enemy." It suggests acting like someone's enemy — being adverse, damaging, or downright hostile. It can refer to anything from emotions and actions to public policy. The U.S. government might declare that another nation's actions are inimical to national security — and your mom might declare that eating a dozen doughnuts every morning is inimical to your health. Be careful not to mix up <i>inimical</i> with <i>inimitable</i>, which means too good to be copied.</p></div>`;
