The <i>woebegone</i> expression on your face tells everyone how totally bummed out you are.</p><p class="long">The word <i>woebegone</i> doesn't make its meaning clear at first glance: it seems to imply that <i>woe</i>, or extreme sadness, is <i>gone</i>. This adjective actually stems from a Middle English phrase, <i>wo begon</i>, "beset or surrounded by woe." So if you see your friend looking upset or glum, you might want to ask, "Why so woebegone?"</p></div>`;
