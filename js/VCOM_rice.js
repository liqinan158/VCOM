At some Chinese restaurants, you get a choice between white <i>rice</i> and brown <i>rice</i>.</p><p class="long">White rice is processed or "polished," so the outer germ is removed â€” it's a staple of Chinese and Indian cuisine, among others. There are many varieties of rice, defined by the color and length of the individual grain. When <i>rice</i> is a verb, it means "force through a sieve," or in other words, to take something like a potato and make it look like rice. We can trace the origin of <i>rice</i> back to the Sanskrit <i>vrihi-s</i>.</p></div>`;
