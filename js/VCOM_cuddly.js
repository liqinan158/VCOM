The same is true for animals and dolls â€” there are some things that seem to be made for cuddling. <i>Cuddly</i> comes from the adorable word <i>cuddle</i>, which probably stems from the obsolete verb <i>cull</i>, "to embrace," or possibly the Middle English <i>couth</i>, "known" or "comfortable with."</p></div></div>`;
