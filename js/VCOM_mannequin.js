A <i>mannequin</i> in a department store window can look quite normal, but a <i>mannequin</i> in someone's home can look downright creepy.</p><p class="long">Any store that sells clothes is likely to have at least a few mannequins, so shoppers can see what dresses and sweaters and hats look like on a (fake) person's body. Another kind of mannequin, more often called a "dressmaker's dummy" is helpful to someone who's sewing a skirt or piecing together a suit. Still other mannequins are used to practice emergency techniques, from CPR to water rescues by the Coast Guard.</p></div>`;
