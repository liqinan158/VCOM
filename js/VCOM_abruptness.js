When you act with <i>abruptness</i>, you do something quickly, with no warning or consideration of how other people feel about it.</p><p class="long">Friends will comment on your abruptness if you suddenly walk away from them in the middle of a conversation. If your favorite restaurant is unexpectedly shut down one day, with a sign saying "out of business," you'll wonder at the abruptness of its closing. The word at the heart of <i>abruptness</i> is the adjective <i>abrupt</i> â€” and it is rooted in the Latin word <i>abruptus</i>, which means "broken off or disconnected."</p></div>`;
