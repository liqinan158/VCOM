Weird light from the garden shed at night? That's an <i>emanation,</i> something, often invisible, that is emitted by something.</p><p class="long"><i>Emanation</i> is very similar in meaning to <i>emission,</i> and the two words are often used interchangeably, though there is an important difference; there tends to be something slightly more other-worldy and inexplicable about an emanation, owing in part to the word's theological use in the Christian religion as a means of describing the Holy Spirit. An emission always has a solid base in reality or science, and an emanation may be just plain spooky.</p></div>`;
