You might also describe them as <i>penny-pinching</i> or call them <i>tightwads</i>. All of these terms provide clear images of hands clutching money tightly inside them â€” <i>closefisted</i> came first, around 1800, and <i>tightwad</i> followed about a hundred years later. The opposite of being <i>closefisted</i>, fittingly, is to be <i>openhanded</i>.</p></div>`;
