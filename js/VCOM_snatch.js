You might eagerly <i>snatch</i> the TV remote or your best friend's idea. <i>Snatching</i> can be nasty.</p><p class="long">You might snatch a lost balloon before it gets away, or snatch your cat before he can escape the room. The verb <i>snatch</i> can also be used in a figurative way, like when you snatch the first job offer that comes your way after graduating from college. The origin is most likely the Middle English word <i>snacche</i>, which means "to suddenly snap at," or in its noun form, "a trap."</p></div>`;
