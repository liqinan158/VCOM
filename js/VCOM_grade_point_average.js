Schools calculate this number by adding every numerical grade and dividing the total by the number of credits or classes. If your grade point average is 3.5, you should be proud of yourself, you've worked hard to earn As and Bs! This number might feel important if you're a dedicated student or applying to colleges, but in the end it's just a number.</p></div></div>`;
