If you don't pay rent for months, you run the risk of <i>eviction</i>.</p><p class="long">It's most often a landlord who brings an eviction against someone who's renting an apartment or house. In most states, an eviction follows some kind of legal action â€” the landlord usually has to prove that the tenant hasn't paid rent or isn't following the terms of the lease. The Late Latin root of the word <i>eviction</i> is <i>evictionem</i>, "recovery of property by judicial decision."</p></div>`;
