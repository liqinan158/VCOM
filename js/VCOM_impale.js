When you're preparing shish kebabs, you <i>impale</i> chunks of marinated vegetables and meat on pointy metal skewers and then cook them on a grill.</p><p class="long"><i>Impale</i> comes from the Medieval Latin word <i>impalare</i>, which means "to push onto a stake." <i>Impale</i> can also mean to kill by piercing with a stake or spear. Legend has it that the only way to kill a vampire is to do exactly that: impale him with a wooden stake through the heart â€” and then stuff his mouth with garlic and chop off his head, too, just to be sure.</p></div>`;
