You might describe your math teacher's pop quizzes as <i>satanic</i>, but that would be a bit of an exaggeration.</p><p class="long">The very first recorded use of the adjective <i>satanic</i> was in John Milton's 1667 epic poem "Paradise Lost," where it literally described things having to do with Satan, or the devil. Some people continue to use <i>satanic</i> to describe things they associate with hell or the devil, while many others use it as a synonym for "cruel" or "evil." The Hebrew root, <i>satan</i>, means "to oppose or plot against."</p></div></div>`;
