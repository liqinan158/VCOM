A creep who sells broken wheelchairs while smiling is <i>slimy</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Slime</i> is a moist and clammy substance, like the stuff a snail leaves behind or the mucus that comes out of your nose. Anything that's slimy is like slime, so it's a good word for describing gross substances. If your oatmeal is slimy, it's less than appetizing, and if a pond is slimy, you probably won't want to swim in it. Figuratively, <i>slimy</i> also means "evil" or "despicable."</p></div></div>`;
