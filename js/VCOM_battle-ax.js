Ancient Roman warriors sometimes carried <i>battle-axes</i> when they rode into combat.</p><p class="long">Battle-axes evolved from everyday axes used as tools: swinging a heavy blade turns out to be both an effective way to split logs and to fend off a charging enemy. The Vikings, Normans, ancient Chinese warriors, and Napoleonic troops all carried battle-axes. It was once fairly common to demean a forceful older woman by calling her a <i>battle-ax</i>, too. This American slang was inspired by temperance activist Carrie Nation and is now considered offensive and outdated.</p></div>`;
