They shouldn't scare you too much, because we all have skeletons under our skin and muscles. Skeletons give our body shape, and parts of the skeleton (like the skull) protect important organs (like the brain). Sometimes, the word <i>skeleton</i> is used to mean the "bare bones" of other things: the skeleton of a financial plan is a basic outline of that plan. If you said someone has a "<i>skeleton</i> in their closet," it means they're hiding something embarrassing or incriminating.</p></div>`;
