Instead of using supernatural or spiritual explanations, <i>naturalism</i> focuses on explanations that come from the laws of nature.</p><p class="long">Beyond the belief that everything can be explained using nature, naturalism is also a term for a particular style of art and literature from the 19th century. Naturalism refers to a realistic approach to art that rejects idealized experiences. So when you look at a painting that embodies the spirit of naturalism, you'll notice it capturing the real world rather than trying to make things look better than they are. With naturalism: what you see is what you get.</p></div></div>`;
