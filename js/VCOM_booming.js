var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">booming</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Something that's <i>booming</i> is growing fast or becoming prosperous, like your <i>booming</i> lemonade stand, which has the neighbors lining up down the block to buy a cup.</p><p class="long">Use this adjective to describe an incredibly successful business, like the booming fireworks sales before the Fourth of July, or anything else that's making money, like your city's booming economy. A different meaning is "deep and resonant," as in a basso opera singer's booming voice. This definition is the older of the two, from <i>boom</i>, "make a deep sound," with the "thriving" meaning from a later use of <i>boom</i>, "burst into prosperity."</p></div>`;
