Well, it seems that you’re <i>uncommunicative</i>, and you’re not willing to talk for whatever reason. How lonely.</p><p class="long">Someone who is uncommunicative has trouble communicating. Maybe they’re tired or grumpy, or maybe their cell phone battery died. The Latin adjective for "shared" is a root word, and no matter why, an uncommunicative person won’t share much, maybe only a few words, sometimes no words at all. You can also say that a book is uncommunicative if it’s very confusing and doesn’t make sense to you. Or you can just stop reading.</p></div>`;
