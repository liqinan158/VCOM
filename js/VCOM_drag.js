In this case, <i>drag</i> is often followed by the words "out" or "on." You could describe a class that drags on for hours, or try to drag out your homework to get out of doing the dishes. You can also drag someone unwillingly into a discussion or other situation. Anything that's boring and tedious can also be called a <i>drag</i> â€” like lunches with your great aunt Martha or cleaning the bathroom.</p></div>`;
