When they break up, they <i>disband.</i> The word <i>disband</i> refers to any group or unit of folks who decide to go their separate ways.</p><p class="long">Long before there were rock bands, groups of friends or warriors would band together for protection or companionship. They would become a band of sorts. The prefix <i>dis</i> comes from the Latin word for "apart." So if people come together to form a band — like Robin Hood's Merry Men — then if they disband, they decide to separate and break apart. Groups don't always disband because they want to. Sometimes police officers or government officials disband groups they believe are a nuisance or a threat.</p></div></div>`;
