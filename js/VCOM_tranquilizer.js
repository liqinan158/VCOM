If someone suffers from severe anxiety, their doctor might prescribe a <i>tranquilizer</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>tranquilizer</i> is commonly used for anti-anxiety or anti-psychotic drugs, but it's not the term most medical professionals use. They are much more likely to use <i>sedative</i>, <i>neuroleptic</i>, or <i>anxiolytic</i> for a calming medication. <i>Tranquilizer</i>, from <i>tranquility</i> or "the state of being calm," was first used for sedatives in 1824, and for anti-anxiety drugs in 1954.</p></div>`;
