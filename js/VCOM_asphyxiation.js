Gangsters in crime movies are always practicing asphyxiation, usually by holding a pillow over someone's head so they can't breathe. You have to be especially careful with small children and asphyxiation risks â€” if they play with a plastic bag and put it over their head, they could accidentally <i>asphyxiate</i> themselves.</p></div></div>`;
