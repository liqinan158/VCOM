Wood carvers <i>whittle</i> pieces of wood, removing bit by bit until what's left is a sailor with a yellow raincoat or a lone wolf howling at the moon.</p><p class="long"><i>Whittle</i> can also mean to reduce an amount or number of items. In this sense, it is commonly paired with the words <i>away</i> or <i>down</i>. A courtroom attorney might "whittle away" at a defendant's alibi until the truth emerges. You might "whittle down" a to-do list or "whittle away" at your student loan debt every month. But only a highly skilled wood carver can whittle a chunk of pine into that old salty dog with a yellow raincoat.</p></div></div>`;
