When a child tries to make dessert by himself, he may make an <i>unaided</i> attempt at baking cookies.</p><p class="long">Use the adjective <i>unaided</i> to describe something that doesn't require help or assistance. The word often refers to a physical process that you can do on your own, like unaided walking: you don't need crutches, a cane, or people to help you. It can also be used to refer to other forms of assistance. For example, someone may say that a politician was unaided by her speechwriters when composing her acceptance speech.</p></div>`;
