Seeming uncertain or confused can <i>destabilize</i> a teacher's ability to control a class.</p><p class="long">Political protesters might seek to destabilize a government or other institution, and lying to your best friend can destabilize your relationship. In both cases, the underlying stability of a situation is shaken, or made less sturdy. The earliest use of <i>destabilize</i> was in a physical sense, if something was literally unstable or shaky. By the 1920s, the word came to also have a more political meaning.</p></div></div>`;
