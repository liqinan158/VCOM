var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">millipede</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>millipede</i> is a long, worm-like bug with a disturbing number of tiny legs. Some <i>millipedes</i> roll into a tiny ball when they're threatened — and you might roll into a tiny ball if you see one in your bedroom. Eek!</p><p class="long">Millipedes have many similarities to centipedes. Both are arthropods (not insects, but tiny animals with exoskeletons), and both have segmented bodies. Rather than a centipede's single pair of legs per segment, a millipede has two pairs. In other words, twice as many legs — which explains the name, <i>millipede</i>, with its roots <i>mille</i>, "thousand," and <i>ped</i>, "foot." Unlike centipedes, millipedes aren't poisonous, which doesn't mean you'll be happy to discover a family of millipedes living in your bathroom.</p></div></div>`;
