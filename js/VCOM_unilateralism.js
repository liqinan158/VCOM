If a government wages war on a neighboring country without the advice of any outside groups, allies, or nearby countries, it's adopting a policy of unilateralism. Any action described this way is completely one-sided, and the roots of the word <i>unilateralism</i> reflect this â€” <i>uni</i> means "one" in Latin, and <i>lateralism</i> comes from <i>latus</i>, or "side."</p></div></div>`;
