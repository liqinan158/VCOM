Whooping cranes were once plentiful in the upper Midwest, where they lived in the marshes of the plains, before nearly being wiped out in the early 20th century. If you're lucky enough to see a whooping crane, you'll recognize it from its white body, dark wing tips, and distinctive "whooping" cry.</p></div>`;
