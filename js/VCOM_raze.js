You can raze the sand dunes in order to make the beach perfectly flat. <i>Raze</i> comes from the word <i>rasen</i>, meaning "to scrape or erase," and it sounds similar to the word <i>erase</i>, which can help you remember its meaning. If you <i>raze</i> something, in a way it has been erased â€” it no longer exists in its previous form.</p></div>`;
