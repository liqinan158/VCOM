Some people think <i>tropical</i> areas make ideal vacation spots; others think they’re just good places for getting mosquito bites.</p><p class="long">This word calls for a crash course in geography. If you stand at Earth’s equator at certain times of the year, you’ll see the Sun directly overhead. However, the Sun “wanders” a bit, and sometimes you have to move north or south to see the Sun right above you; latitude lines called tropics show just how far north and south you have to go. The region between each tropic and the equator is considered tropical. For more details, see your travel agent.</p></div></div>`;
