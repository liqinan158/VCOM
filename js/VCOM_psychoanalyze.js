When doctors <i>psychoanalyze</i> patients, they encourage discussion of their feelings, childhood, and dreams.</p><p class="long">If a therapist psychoanalyzes you, you'll probably sit in a chair or lie on a couch while you talk about your feelings. A doctor who practices this kind of therapy is called a <i>psychoanalyst</i>, and her goal may be to help you realize the unconscious conflicts that make it hard for you to feel happy. The first person to psychoanalyze a patient was the Austrian doctor Sigmund Freud, in the 1890s.</p></div>`;
