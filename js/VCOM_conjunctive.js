A <i>conjunctive</i> effort between two people is a combined attempt to get something done, and the word "and" in this very sentence is <i>conjunctive</i> since it's joining two phrases together.</p><p class="long">The word <i>conjunctive</i> often comes up in medical terminology, in phrases like "<i>conjunctive</i> tissue," or tissue that connects different parts of the body. Another kind of <i>conjunctive</i> is a part of speech — like the words "but" and "or" — that connects phrases or words within a sentence. <i>Conjunctive</i> comes from the Latin word <i>coniunctivus</i>, "serving to connect," with its root of <i>coniungere</i>, "to join together."</p></div>`;
