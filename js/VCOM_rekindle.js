Likewise, if you've lost touch with a childhood friend, you might try to rekindle your relationship when you meet again as adults. <i>Re</i> means "again," and <i>kindle</i> means "start a fire," probably from the Old Norse <i>kynda</i>, "to light a fire." <i>Rekindle</i> has been used in the figurative sense from around 1300.</p></div></div>`;
