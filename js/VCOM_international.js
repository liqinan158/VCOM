The first half is the prefix <i>inter</i>-, which means “among,” or “between.” In the second half, you can see the word <i>nation</i>.  Put them together and the word literally means “among or between nations.”  Driving from the United States into Canada is an international road trip since you travel from on nation to another, and an international conference has guests from all over the world.</p></div></div>`;
