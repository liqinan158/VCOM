That was in 1859. You can picture an accused person approaching a judge, or "coming up" to the front of a courtroom. Guilt, innocence â€” comeuppance can be either, and it can apply to things beyond the justice system. Nowadays you'll most likely hear this word describe something bad. If someone gets a deserved punishment, you'd say "He got his comeuppance."</p></div>`;
