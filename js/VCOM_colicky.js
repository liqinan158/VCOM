A <i>colicky</i> baby doesn't get much sleep â€” and neither do her parents.</p><p class="long">While there are different sorts of colic, or abdominal pain, the adjective <i>colicky</i> is most often used to describe human infants. Because babies can't tell you where it hurts, long bouts of crying frequently result in a diagnosis of a colicky baby. Doctors guess that being colicky is a result of intestinal gas or other digestive troubles, and the root of the word is the Greek <i>kolon</i>, "lower intestine."</p></div>`;
