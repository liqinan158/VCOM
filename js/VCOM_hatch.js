Then, when the chick emerges from the egg, you can also say it <i>hatched</i>.</p><p class="long">Humans don't <i>hatch</i> eggs like birds do, but they can still incubate and then hatch a plan, invention, or idea. You may hatch a plan to surprise a friend for her thirtieth birthday party, but to ensure you don't end up with egg on your face, you should verify your friend isn't actually twenty-nine for the third year in a row! As a noun, a <i>hatch</i> is a trapdoor or other opening in the floor, ceiling, or wall that allows access.</p></div></div>`;
