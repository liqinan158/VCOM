Politicians and schoolteachers are the usual suspects of this manner of behavior, known as <i>grandiloquence,</i> but it can refer to anything that's overbearing or pompous in style or manner. Architecture, especially, is highly guilty of being grandiloquent â€” if you check out just about anything built in the Baroque style, you could describe it as grandiloquent.</p></div>`;
