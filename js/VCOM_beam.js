The beams in your kitchen ceiling help support the upstairs floor just above it.</p><p class="long">In construction, beams are made of wood or metal and are used to frame a building and provide structure. In gymnastics, a <i>beam</i> is used for balancing and doing tricks on. If someone comments that you're getting "broad in the <i>beam</i>," they're disparaging the width of your body, especially your hips. In Old English, a <i>beam</i> first meant a tree, and later a rafter or a ship's timber.</p></div>`;
