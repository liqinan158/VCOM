Putting a dozen dogs and a dozen cats in the same room would probably lead to utter <i>chaos</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>chaos</i> derives from a Greek word meaning "chasm" or "void," which makes sense, given that <i>chaos</i> also refers to the formless state of matter before the cosmos was created. In math and science, <i>chaos</i> describes a system that will develop in wildly different ways with only tiny changes to the initial conditions. "Controlled <i>chaos</i>" is a phrase often used casually to describe something that looks out of control but which functions according to unseen rules or organization.</p></div>`;
