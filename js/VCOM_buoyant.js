Since floating is happier than sinking, <i>buoyant</i> also refers to things are fun and upbeat.</p><p class="long">Someone with a buoyant personality is fun to be around, laughs a lot, smiles, and cheers other people up. Buoyant people are lively and lighthearted — the opposite of sad, depressed, and bummed out. Buoyant people are also called <i>bubbly</i> and <i>cheerful</i>, and it should help to remember that buoyant objects float — just like a buoyant person can seem like they're floating too (as in the expression "floating on air").</p></div>`;
