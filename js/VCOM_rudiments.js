In any introductory course, you're going to learn the rudiments of a subject. For example, Psychology 101 will teach the rudiments of psychology. For very complex subjects — like nuclear physics — even the rudiments might be hard for the average person to understand. But if you don't master the rudiments first, you're not going to get very far.</p></div>`;
