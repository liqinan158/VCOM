If you have what your doctor describes as "<i>ocular</i> pain," it means your eye hurts.</p><p class="long">The word <i>ocular</i> is a medical term meaning "of the eye." An ocular nerve connects to the eye, and an ocular specialist is an eye doctor. If you get an ocular exam, you'll have your vision tested or your eyes examined. If you get ocular damage from a stray baseball, you've got a hurt eyeball. <i>Ocular</i> comes from a Latin root, <i>oculus</i>, "an eye."</p></div></div>`;
