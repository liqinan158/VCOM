Not getting enough sleep night after night can be self-destructive. Other self-destructive actions are dangerous in a different way. It's self-destructive for someone to spend their paycheck gambling at a casino, or for an office worker to steal money from the company they work for. <i>Destructive</i> is rooted in the Latin <i>destruere</i>, "demolish," or literally "un-build."</p></div></div>`;
