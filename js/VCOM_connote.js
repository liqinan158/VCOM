For example, if you fold your arms and look away from someone as he speaks to you, you are connoting your discomfort.</p><p class="long">When you act a certain way to show how you feel rather than just outright saying it, you're <i>connoting</i> or suggesting that emotion. Words can often connote or suggest certain meanings or ideas.  The word <i>turbulent</i> connotes the image of a bumpy ride on an airplane, for example. <i>Connote</i> is also used in formal logic. If A connotes B, then for A to be true, B has to also be true.</p></div>`;
