Bummer.  <i>Fleeting</i> comes from the Old English word <i>flēotan</i>, which means “float, swim.”  Like a ghost ship floating by on a foggy night, fleeting things disappear as fast as they appear.  Fleeting love may last more than a moment, but it won’t stay for very long, and that’s why it’s called fleeting.</p></div>`;
