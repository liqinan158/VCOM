Don't cry â€” he just wants to <i>abridge</i> your masterpiece, trimming it down to the more readable essential elements.</p><p class="long">Synonymous with <i>abbreviate</i>, <i>condense</i> and <i>cut short</i>, <i>abridge</i> comes from the Latin word <i>abreviare</i>, which means "to shorten." Although it's usually used in reference to wordy texts, one can also <i>abridge</i> or shorten a piece of clothing; a miniskirt is just an abridged version of the old floor length hoop skirt, for example. But abridging something isn't always good: If your civil rights are abridged, they've been lessened in some way.</p></div></div>`;
