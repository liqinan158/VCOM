Then you tell me what brand, year and model it is, because in this case <i>make</i> means "type made."</p><p class="long">The noun <i>make</i> is either a type or a fancy card move, but as a verb, it has tons of uses, either related to forming things (you made a pie!), or forcing things (you made me make a pie). You can also make money. It can mean "act," like when you "make like a dog." You can make first place, and then make out with someone to celebrate. You really do make a nice couple.</p></div></div>`;
