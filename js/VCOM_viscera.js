Your <i>viscera</i> are your innards or your guts. In popular usage the term refers to the intestines, but technically it includes all soft internal organs.</p><p class="long"><i>Viscera</i> comes from the Latin <i>viscus</i>, meaning "an inner part of the body." You won't hear it much nowadays unless you're studying anatomy or describing particularly gory special effects. (Parents object to ultra-violent videogames where bodies explode, spewing viscera.) Don't confuse it with the related <i>visceral</i>, which does crop up often today and means "instinctive." "She had a <i>visceral</i> reaction to seeing her boyfriend and his hunting pals covered in deer blood and <i>viscera</i>, and dumped him the next day."</p></div>`;
