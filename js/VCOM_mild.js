There’s nothing wild about <i>mild</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Mild</i> comes from the Old English word <i>milde</i> for "gentle." Indeed, mild people are gentle. They don't brag or do cartwheels in supermarkets. They're mellow and submissive. Things can be mild too. Mild salsa doesn’t have many hot peppers. Mild can also mean slight, or small amount, as in a mild cold that doesn’t keep you home from school. If you skip school because you have a mild headache, you might just get a mild punishment.</p></div>`;
