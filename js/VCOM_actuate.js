The "act" in <i>actuate</i> can remind you of this word's meaning — to put into action. A lever might <i>actuate</i> a pump, or malice might <i>actuate</i> a crime.</p><p class="long">Coming to us from the Latin word <i>actus</i>, which means "to act," <i>actuate's</i> meaning is simpler than it sounds — it just means to set in motion or activate some kind of motion. Think of one of those complex Rube Goldberg mouse traps; you know, the one where the boot kicks the ball that drops on the plank that tips over the ladder which rings a bell that cracks an egg that knocks over the cage onto the unsuspecting mouse. The boot actuates the whole shebang.</p></div></div>`;
