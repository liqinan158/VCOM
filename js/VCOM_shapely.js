You might start going to the gym to run and lift weights with the goal of becoming more <i>shapely</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>shapely</i> most often describes a woman, but there's no reason you can't use it to talk about a nicely shaped man as well. You could describe a mountain climber you know as being physically fit, with shapely legs, or complain that fashion magazines are full of identical shapely models, with no variation of body types. <i>Shapely</i> has been used in English since the fourteenth century, from the Old English root word <i>gesceap</i>, or "creation, form, or destiny."</p></div>`;
