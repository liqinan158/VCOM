When you ride your bike at dusk in the summertime, right through clouds of <i>innumerous</i> mosquitoes, it's important to keep your mouth closed.</p><p class="long">There are innumerous stars in the sky and innumerous grains of sand on the beach. You could also write a poem about the innumerous things you love about your girlfriend. <i>Innumerous</i> is primarily a literary adjective, so using it in a poem is a good idea. It comes from the Latin <i>numerus</i>, "a number," and the "not" prefix, <i>in-</i>, essentially "not able to be numbered."</p></div></div>`;
