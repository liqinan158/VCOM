A <i>distressing</i> phone call from your dad might involve him telling you your grandma is in the hospital.</p><p class="long">When something causes <i>distress</i>, "anxiety, sorrow, or pain," you can describe it as <i>distressing</i>. Both words come from the Vulgar Latin <i>districtia</i>, "restraint, affliction, or narrowness," from <i>distringere</i>, "draw apart or hinder" in Latin. Distressing headlines in the newspaper convey terrible news, and distressing text messages from your friend might make you worry for her safety.</p></div>`;
