If you're on a cargo ship, you're probably at work; if you're on a <i>yacht</i>, it's probably your day off.</p><p class="long">While today a <i>yacht</i> is usually a pleasure vessel, and associated with wealth and recreation, its origins are anything but: the word <i>yacht</i> comes from the early modern Dutch <i>jaghtschip</i>, which referred to “a fast pirate ship,” and <i>jacht</i> meant “hunting.” You won’t find many yachts doing any hunting today — but you might find one cruising around the bay or parked at the yacht club. <i>Yacht</i> can also be a verb meaning  to travel in a yacht.</p></div>`;
