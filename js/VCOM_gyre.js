You'll see a gyre when you look straight at certain blossoms â€” the rings of petals in a rose, for example, form a gyre. Some plants have gyres of leaves making concentric circles. In late Middle English, to <i>gyre</i> was to "spin something around in circles," from the Greek root word <i>gyros</i>, "circle or ring."</p></div></div>`;
