There's no school. During summer vacation, you'll do lots of things — but you won't be in school. You might even go somewhere for a vacation. Another meaning of <i>vacation</i> is "voiding something legal," like the vacation of the old law about not tying your horse in front of City Hall.</p></div>`;
