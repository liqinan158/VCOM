Usually, it’s the police, FBI, or other law-enforcement officials who <i>interrogate</i> suspects, but your father-in-law may <i>interrogate</i> you about your career plans.</p><p class="long"><i>Interrogate</i> comes from the Latin prefix <i>inter-</i>, “between” added to the Latin verb <i>rogare</i>, “to ask.” To interrogate someone is not just asking a few polite questions over a cup of tea. When you interrogate someone there is usually a method to the questioning with a specific mission in mind, like determining a criminal's motive or where she stashed the loot. Your college entrance interview may feel like an interrogation, but their mission is really just to get to know you.</p></div></div>`;
