You might keep socks in one <i>drawer</i> and t-shirts in another.</p><p class="long">Dressers have drawers, and so do other pieces of furniture, including desks, bureaus, and kitchen cabinets. Your kitchen drawers might be full of silverware, while the drawers in your office are a jumble of pens, paper clips, and Post-It notes. <i>Drawer</i> comes from the verb <i>draw</i>, from its "pull" meaning â€” the original idea of the word was that it's a container that's "drawn" out of a cabinet.</p></div>`;
