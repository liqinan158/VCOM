You can watch the <i>withering</i> of a flower bouquet in water â€” over the days and weeks, the blossoms become droopy and faded.</p><p class="long">You might talk about the withering of trees in a drought or the withering of people's bank accounts during an economic recession. <i>Withering</i> can also be used as an adjective, to describe something with a terrible, destructive strength, like a withering hurricane. It comes from the verb <i>wither</i>, to dry up or shrivel, from the Old English word <i>wydderen</i>, which is a variation on <i>wederen</i>, "to expose to the weather."</p></div></div>`;
