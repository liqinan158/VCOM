That's because <i>perpetrate</i> means to commit or be responsible for something â€” usually something mischievous or bad.</p><p class="long">If you manage to slip a whoopee cushion under your teacher's rear without her seeing it, then you've perpetrated a classic prank. But if you use your wily ways to break into the bank's safe, then you've just turned yourself into "a felony-class <i>perpetrator</i>." So do yourself a favor and stick to perpetrating lesser crimes.</p></div>`;
