You might scream in <i>fright</i> while watching a scary movie or riding a roller coaster.</p><p class="long">Some fright is so intense that it makes you jump; other fright is caused by anticipating something vaguely scary, like a trip to the dentist or an encounter with your mean neighbor after your baseball breaks her window. Although it's old fashioned, you can also use <i>fright</i> as a verb, to mean "cause fear." The Old English root of <i>fright</i> is <i>fyrhtu</i>, "fear, dread, trembling, or horrible sight."</p></div>`;
