You can also call a general state of uncleanliness filth. You might say that the filth in your brother's room makes it impossible to open the door. Some people also use this word for material they deem to be obscene. The Old English root word is <i>fyl√∞</i>, which means "rotting matter." Ew.</p></div>`;
