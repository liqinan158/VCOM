You might admire the fact that your friend is kind, generous, and an excellent pool player <i>withal</i>.</p><p class="long">While you'll come across the noun <i>wherewithal</i> from time to time, you're much less likely to hear someone use <i>withal</i>, which is considered archaic, or extremely old-fashioned. This curious word was used to mean "in addition," but also "nevertheless" and sometimes "with." So you might read sentences like "They were excited but nervous withal." And if you read a lot of Shakespeare, you'll come across <i>withal</i> frequently. It stems from the Middle English <i>with alle</i>, "wholly."</p></div></div>`;
