You can think of a <i>frittata</i> as an Italian omelette.</p><p class="long">The origin of the word <i>frittata</i> is the Italian <i>friggere</i>, "fried," and in Italy it was once a common way to describe any egg dish cooked in butter or oil in a pan. Some chefs describe frittatas as "open-faced omelettes," since omelettes are eggs folded around a savory filling, while a frittata's ingredients are incorporated into the egg mixture. Next time you have a bunch of eggs and some cheese and peppers, you should try making a frittata.</p></div></div>`;
