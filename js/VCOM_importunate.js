Importunate restaurant patrons tend to inundate their unfortunate waiter with demands, and one student's importunate questions can keep a teacher busy through an entire class period. You'll see in <i>importunate</i> the Latin root <i>port</i>, which means "harbor." From this came <i>importunus</i>, "troublesome," but also "having no harbor."</p></div>`;
