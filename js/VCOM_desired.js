Something desired, then, is an object of desire. A desired job is one that many people seek. A desired cake looks delicious —  you see it and you want to have it. When a type of clothing becomes popular, it’s desired by many. Some things are desired because they are rare, like a comic book with the first appearance of Batman. Anything desired is coveted.</p></div>`;
