A <i>clarinet</i> has a simple, straight tube with intricate keys, a single-reed mouthpiece, and a flared, bell-shaped end.</p><p class="long">When you play the clarinet, you blow through the mouthpiece and make notes with your fingers on the keys. Clarinets are distinctive because they are straight, with a black body and silver keys, and have a large pitch range. The word <i>clarinet</i> comes from the French <i>clarinette</i>, the diminutive form of <i>clarine</i>. "little bell," which comes from <i>clair</i>, "bright or clear."</p></div></div>`;
