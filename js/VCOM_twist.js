You might <i>twist</i> off a bottle cap, or you might even <i>twist</i> the plot of a story you are writing.</p><p class="long">A kite's tail twists in the wind, curling around itself, and a baker twists a piece of dough into a pretzel shape. You can also twist out of someone's grasp (to escape your godmother's cheek pinching), or twist your ankle hurrying away. As a noun, <i>twist</i> means a bent and curved shape, like the twist of a curl or a twist of soft serve ice cream. In a book or movie plot, a twist is a shocking development.</p></div></div>`;
