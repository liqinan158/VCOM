Your least favorite thing about the kids you babysit might be their <i>petulance</i>.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>petulance</i> is the quality of being fretful, complaining, petty, or generally cranky. It's not a pleasant characteristic â€” it's almost always described negatively, like when you talk about the childishness and petulance of your constantly whining boss or the petulance of a hotel guest who complains about the pillows being too fluffy. <i>Petulance</i> comes from the Latin <i>petulantia</i>, which means insolence or immodesty.</p></div></div>`;
