You'll listen <i>avidly</i> to your grandfather's stories if he makes them vivid and enthralling.</p><p class="long">People who participate avidly in a club or group are seriously involved, and if you avidly follow college basketball, you're a huge fan and watch as many games as you can. Doing things avidly means really throwing yourself into the spirit of things. <i>Avidly</i> comes from its related adjective, <i>avid</i>, or "having enthusiasm for something," from the Latin <i>avidus</i>, "longing, desirous, or greedy," from the root <i>avere</i>, "to desire eagerly."</p></div></div>`;
