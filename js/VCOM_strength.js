The strength of something can be the measure of how much force or pressure it can withstand over time (like a flood wall). Or its potency (like a pesticide). Or its intensity level (like a radio signal). Its fighting capabilities (like an army). Or its specialty: A chameleon's strength is actually in its ability to blend in with its surroundings.</p></div></div>`;
