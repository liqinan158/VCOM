Many Christians believe in the <i>inerrancy</i> of the Bible.</p><p class="long">You're most likely to come across the noun <i>inerrancy</i> in a religious context. It usually describes Christian religious writing — particularly the Bible — and the word of God. People who believe in a literal interpretation of the Bible are most likely to emphasize its inerrancy. In other words, they think that everything in the Bible is the literal truth. <i>Inerrancy</i> comes from <i>inerrant</i>, which originally referred to stars in the sky, and which is rooted in <i>inerrantem</i>, "not wandering" in Latin.</p></div></div>`;
