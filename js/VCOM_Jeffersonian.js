Jefferson strongly opposed the Federalists because he saw them as being too British and too accepting of aristocratic traditions, and Jeffersonian philosophy emphasized the right of the working man to vote. Another highlight of the Jeffersonian era included a non-interventionist foreign policy — more recent presidents, including Barack Obama, are sometimes described as having Jeffersonian policies.</p></div>`;
