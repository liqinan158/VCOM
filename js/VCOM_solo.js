Until the end of the 17th century, just the Latin form was used, usually in stage directions. Then it entered musical terminology, as <i>sola</i>, in 1695. The adjectival use developed in the 18th century, and in 1864 the form <i>soloist</i>, referring to one who performed a solo, first appeared. It wasn't until the mid-19th century that the word was used as a verb.</p></div>`;
