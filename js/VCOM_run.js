If you're plotting your escape from the Tower of London, you can "make a <i>run</i> for it," and if you're a baseball player, you're a hero if you make a home run. When your play opens on Broadway, you hope it will have many performances — "a long <i>run</i>" — and if you're lucky, the New York Times will run a rave review.</p></div></div>`;
