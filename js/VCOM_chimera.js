And it breathes fire. No creature like that has ever existed, but the idea seemed real and terrifying to Greeks, and that’s another meaning: an idea that feels real but is impossible, like the idea of a world without evil.  Pronouncing the word is very possible though; just try it one of two ways: either kye-MEER-uh or kih-MEER-uh. Both work.</p></div>`;
