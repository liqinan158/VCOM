A stressed-out mother of four little kids might find her patience <i>depleted</i> after a crazed birthday party at the roller rink.</p><p class="long">The word <i>depleted</i> comes from the Latin <i>deplere</i>, "to empty," or literally "to un-fill." You may have seen depleted shelves where bread and milk used to be if you visit a grocery store before a big snow storm. If you tend to get sick a lot, it may be because your immune system is depleted, or worn out, and a river can become depleted, or dried up, after a long drought.</p></div>`;
