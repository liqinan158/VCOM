If the <i>postage</i> for mailing your brother's collection of porcelain pigs is too high, you might want to bring them with you when you drive to his house instead.</p><p class="long">Use the noun <i>postage</i> for the expense of mailing letters and packages, or for the stamps themselves: "Don't forget to attach the postage before you put that in the mailbox!" Some people, in fact, refer to them as "postage stamps." <i>Postage</i> comes from <i>post</i>, "mail system": early mail carriers were "posted" along a road, like a relay race, to speed delivery.</p></div>`;
