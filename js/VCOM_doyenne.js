Then you can call yourself the <i>doyenne</i> of cupcakes. A <i>doyenne</i> is an undisputed expert at something.</p><p class="long">Since 1905, <i>doyenne</i> has been used to mean "leading or senior woman in a group or society," from the French <i>doyen</i>, "senior member." While you can refer to any elder as a doyenne (like the leader of your Girl Scout troop), these days it's most commonly used for someone who's considered one of the most respected in a field. Oprah Winfrey has been called the doyenne of daytime TV more than once in her life.</p></div></div>`;
