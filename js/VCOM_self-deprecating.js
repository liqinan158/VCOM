The opposite type of person is self-deprecating, dwelling on his own faults and even joking about how he's short, unsuccessful, or not that smart. Being self-deprecating is usually considered a good trait, a quality of someone with a wry sense of humor. When being self-deprecating goes too far, it can become self-loathing and self-sabotaging, which are less amusing forms of putting yourself down.</p></div>`;
