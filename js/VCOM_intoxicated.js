var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">intoxicated</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Someone who's <i>intoxicated</i> has had too much to drink. Visit an Irish pub on St. Patrick's Day and you're sure to see at least one <i>intoxicated</i> person.</p><p class="long">When you describe someone as <i>intoxicated</i>, you usually mean that he's been drinking alcoholic beverages until he feels dizzy and sick. You can also use the word to talk about someone who's really excited or happy about something: "She was <i>intoxicated</i> by Paris the minute she stepped off the airplane." Before <i>intoxicated</i> was first used to mean "drunk" in the 1570's, it meant "poisoned," which especially makes sense when you know the Latin root word, <i>intoxicare</i>, "to poison."</p></div></div>`;
