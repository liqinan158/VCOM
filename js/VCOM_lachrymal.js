Your dramatic friend's <i>lachrymal</i> outburst after you forgot her birthday probably included a lot of weeping and wailing.</p><p class="long">When you spell <i>lachrymal</i> with a <i>y</i>, it tends to be literary or old-fashioned, like the lachrymal heroine of a nineteenth century novel. When it's spelled <i>lachrimal</i>, the meaning is usually more scientific, like the lachrimal gland in your eye, from which tears fall when you're sad or chopping onions. <i>Lachrymal</i> comes from the Greek <i>dakryma</i>, "tear," by way of the Latin <i>lacrima</i>, also "tear."</p></div></div>`;
