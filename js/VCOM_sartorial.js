In English the adjectives <i>sartorial</i> and <i>sartorially</i> are used to refer to any matter pertaining to the consideration of clothing or fashion. The root word <i>sartor</i> has also made its way into the field of biology. The sartorius — a muscle in the leg and the longest muscle in the human body — gets its name because it is used when crossing the legs, also known as the “tailor's position."</p></div>`;
