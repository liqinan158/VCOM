Your travel bag of <i>toiletries</i> might include tiny bottles of shampoo, dental floss, deodorant, and soap.</p><p class="long">You'll often find this word in its plural form, <i>toiletries</i>. Aid organizations often distribute toiletries to disaster victims so they can clean and care for themselves. And when you pack for a trip, your toiletries are nearly as important as your clothing â€” without them, you can't brush your teeth or wash your hair! This word stems from <i>toilet</i> and its somewhat old-fashioned meaning, "the process of washing, dressing, and attending to one's appearance."</p></div></div>`;
