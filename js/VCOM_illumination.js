Kids up past their bedtimes have been known to read entire books under their covers using only the <i>illumination</i> from a flashlight.</p><p class="long">Use the noun <i>illumination</i> to talk about light, like the illumination of the moon on the surface of a lake. <i>Illumination</i> can also refer to an understanding or a spiritual awareness, like when a mystery of your faith suddenly makes sense to you. The Latin root is <i>illuminationem</i>, "throw into light" â€” you can picture the light bulb over a person's head in a cartoon to remember the various meaning of <i>illumination</i>.</p></div>`;
