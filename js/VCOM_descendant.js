For example, everyone is a <i>descendant</i>, or the end of a line of ancestors, just as modern art is a <i>descendant</i> of past art that contributed to its style and technique.</p><p class="long">The word <i>descendant</i> comes from the word "descend" which means to move in a downward direction.  Note that the word can also be spelled with an "-ent" ending. Philosopher  Herbert Spencer wrote, “The wise man must remember that while he is a descendant of the past, he is a parent of the future.”  Have you ever wondered what your descendants will know about you?  Perhaps you could leave them your peanut butter and banana sandwich recipe.</p></div>`;
