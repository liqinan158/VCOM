The first has a short, stiff skirt attached to a bodice, and the second has a longer, flowing skirt. Many tutu skirts are made of <i>tulle</i>, a kind of netting that's stiff and lightweight, and this may be the origin of the word <i>tutu</i>, although neither word experts nor ballet experts are certain.</p></div></div>`;
