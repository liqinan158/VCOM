The lower the number on the <i>pH</i> scale, the more acid a substance contains.</p><p class="long">The pH scale goes from 0 to 14, with 0 being the most acidic. The higher, low-acid numbers on the pH scale are <i>basic</i> â€” they feel slippery and have an astringent taste. Substances at around 7, the middle of the pH scale, are neutral, like water. Lemon juice has a pH of 2.2, since it's acidic. <i>pH</i> comes from the German word <i>Potenz</i>, "potency or power," and <i>H</i>, the chemical symbol for hydrogen.</p></div></div>`;
