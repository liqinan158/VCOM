If an expensive restaurant has soft lighting and peaceful music, it has a pleasant, soothing <i>ambience</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Ambience</i> is one of those words that we've out and out stolen from French. In French, the word meaning the same thing is, you guessed it, <i>ambience</i>. This is a word you're going to want to know if you have any interest in restaurant reviews â€” they always want to talk about the ambience. As a funny quirk, the word has a positive feel to it; it can be used to mean nice atmosphere without even using the word, nice, as in, "Hey, this place really has <i>ambience</i>."</p></div>`;
