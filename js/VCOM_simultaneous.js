var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">simultaneous</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The adjective <i>simultaneous</i> describes something that is done at the same time as something else. "The teachers all assigned <i>simultaneous</i> projects to the students that week. The kids were grumbling and sleep-deprived due to the grind."</p><p class="long">The Latin root of <i>simultaneous</i> is <i>simul</i>, which also means "at the same time." One way to remember this word is to think of <i>simulcast</i> programs that are <i>simultaneously</i> available through different television networks, radio stations or Web sites â€” so you can catch that concert on TV while your friend is listening to it on his car radio.</p></div>`;
