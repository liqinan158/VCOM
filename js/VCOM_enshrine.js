To <i>enshrine</i> is to put something special, often religious, into a protective place.</p><p class="long">A shrine is a place considered holy because something special happened there or a case that holds sacred items. Places where people have claimed to see Jesus sometimes become shines. When you enshrine something, it means you are creating a shrine around it, or you are giving it its own protected revered space. This can be literal or figurative. At a funeral, the minister might say that the deceased will forever be enshrined in the memories of those who loved him or her.</p></div>`;
