If you are down and can't rise before the ref counts to ten, consider it a <i>knockout</i>.</p><p class="long">In full-contact fighting sports, including boxing, karate, and kickboxing, the ultimate goal is a match-winning knockout of the opponent. Not all boxing matches end this way, but a knockout is the most exciting (and dangerous) way for a match to end. This word is also used to mean "gorgeous person," so if someone tells you you're a knockout, you can be sure they mean it as a compliment.</p></div>`;
