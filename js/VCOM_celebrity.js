If you single-handedly save an entire family from a burning building, you'll become a local <i>celebrity</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Celebrity</i> comes directly from the Latin <i>celebritatum</i>, meaning famous, and is related to the verb <i>celebrate</i> which means to honor something with the proper ritual. We usually use <i>celebrity</i> now when we talk about entertainment stars, but someone doesn't have to be on the supermarket tabloids to be a celebrity. <i>Celebrity</i> can also be used to mean the state of fame. If you are seeking celebrity, develop a thick skin for nasty rumors.</p></div>`;
