It also can mean deeply evocative. A <i>resonant </i> speech moves you by bringing to mind all that is good in the world: family, friends, laughter.</p><p class="long"><i>Resonant</i> comes from the Latin <i>re</i>, meaning again, and <i>sonare</i>, meaning to sound––or literally to sound again or echo. So <i>resonant's</i> meanings all have that sense of reverberating or echoing. Not only does it mean echoing or evoking meaning, but it also refers to sound that echoes through a room. Don't confuse the spellings of resonant (the adjective) and resonate (the verb).</p></div></div>`;
