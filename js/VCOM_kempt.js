Your unkempt, scraggly beard might contrast, for example, with your brother's closely shaven, kempt face. The unkempt bedroom your sister is happy to inhabit is much messier than your own orderly, uncluttered, kempt room. <i>Kempt</i> shares a root with <i>comb</i>, which explains why it usually describes someone's tidy hair.</p></div>`;
