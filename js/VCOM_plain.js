Being a <i>plain</i> talker means you don't use pretentious, fancy words. But having a <i>plain</i> face means you're not much to look at.</p><p class="long"><i>Plain</i> comes from the Latin word <i>planum,</i> meaning "level ground." That's one meaning of the word, as in a flat prairie or low lying coastal flood plain. If something is in plain view, it's out in the open with no obstructions. But usually we use <i>plain</i> as an adjective to describe unembellished, bare, or unimpressive things. A white room with just an old bed and a chair is pretty plain.</p></div></div>`;
