You can buy <i>aspirin</i> at a drug store, supermarket, or convenience store.</p><p class="long"><i>Aspirin</i> is an anti-inflammatory drug â€” it reduces pain, swelling, and fever. Some people take aspirin in very small amounts to reduce the risk of having a stroke or heart attack, and since the late 1800s people have taken it to ease the pain of head and body aches. The word <i>aspirin</i>, coined by a German chemist, was originally a trademarked brand name, from the Latin <i>Spiraea</i>, the plant from which aspirin's chemicals were originally extracted.</p></div></div>`;
