Look up at the sky during a violent thunderstorm and chances are you'll catch thunder and lightning <i>fulminate</i> or explode loudly and violently overhead. But you needn't look to the sky alone for this kind of intensity. If you find yourself in a room with passionate Republicans and Democrats debating, you might see them <i>fulminate</i> or severely rail against each other's beliefs.</p></div></div>`;
