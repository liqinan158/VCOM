A <i>dovish</i> president is more likely to sign peace treaties than to start a war.</p><p class="long">While <i>dovish</i> can mean simply "peaceful and innocent," it's much more common to find it in political writing or speech, particularly in contrast to <i>hawkish</i>. Dovish advisors and cabinet members can influence a government to strive for peaceful resolutions to conflict, while hawkish politicians tend to favor aggressive policies. This political meaning dates from the 1960s.</p></div>`;
