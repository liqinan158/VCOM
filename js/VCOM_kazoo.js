The sound a <i>kazoo</i> makes is a silly, buzzing one. You wouldn't want to spend a relaxing evening listening to <i>kazoo</i> tunes.</p><p class="long">Kazoos are small, simple toys made of metal or plastic. All you have to do to play a kazoo is hum a tune. A membrane inside the kazoo vibrates, turning your humming voice into a musical sound. Kazoos were invented in the 1880s, and in the US they were given the imitative name <i>kazoo</i>, from the earlier slang <i>bazoo</i>, or "trumpet." In the UK, kazoos were originally called "Timmy Talkers."</p></div>`;
