If you imagine taking that bitter taste on your tongue and turning it into an emotion, you've got another meaning of <i>bitter</i>: a resentful, angry feeling. And if you turn that bitter flavor into a physical feeling, you've got an adjective that describes a sharp, unpleasant sensation, like a cold, bitter wind.</p></div></div>`;
