This word is too old-sounding and unusual to be very insulting. Still, you shouldn't call anyone a <i>harlot</i>, because it's a term — just like "whore," "strumpet," and "lady of the night" — for a woman who has sex for money. That's never been a compliment, even though today the world's oldest profession has a much nicer term: <i>sex worker</i>.</p></div></div>`;
