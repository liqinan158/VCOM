If you forget to hold your breath when you go underwater, you're sure to come up sputtering. The noun <i>hold</i> means the cargo area on a ship or airplane. When you check your bag, it's stored in the hold of the plane during the flight. If you packed your book and your snacks in it, it might make more sense to hold onto it instead.</p></div>`;
