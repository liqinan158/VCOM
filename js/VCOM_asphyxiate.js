Choking on a piece of food can <i>asphyxiate</i> a person.</p><p class="long">Your body needs to breathe oxygen in order to function, and when it's deprived of oxygen that's called <i>asphyxia</i> or <i>asphyxiation</i>. If a person stops being able to breathe, you can also say they <i>asphyxiate</i>. The origin of this verb is <i>asphyxia</i>, "stopping of the pulse," in Greek, which originally had the same meaning in English, before it came to mean "suffocation."</p></div>`;
