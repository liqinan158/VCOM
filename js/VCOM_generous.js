It's <i>generous</i> of your friend to take the couch and let you sleep in the bed when you stay over at her place. She didn't have to do that.</p><p class="long">When you decide to go one step beyond what's expected of you, you're being generous. A generous helping of food is a bigger than expected scoop of mashed potatoes. A generous teacher is one who volunteers to stay after school to help you with your homework. Be generous yourself: don't forget the letter <i>o</i> when you spell the word <i>generous</i>. Just think of it as a generous act, throwing that extra letter in there.</p></div>`;
