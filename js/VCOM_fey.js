That’s a <i>fey</i> person, someone who seems like they come from another world, kind of like an elf.</p><p class="long">There’s a <i>fey</i> girl, let’s call her Faye. Fey Faye is not an elf nor a witch, but she seems supernatural in a vague way, and her voice sounds like a magic flute.  <i>Fey</i> comes from the Old English word <i>fǣge</i>, or literally “fated to die soon,” which refers to that odd good mood a person is in right before they die.  Don’t worry, that definition isn’t used anymore, and fey Faye isn’t dying.  But she is kind of spooky.</p></div>`;
