A writer might describe a cowboy as speaking in a lazy <i>drawl</i>.</p><p class="long">A drawl tends to lengthen and extend vowel sounds in particular, so that words like "pet" or "pen" might be pronounced with two syllables, rather than one short one. While the Southern states are best known for inhabitants with drawls, Australian and New Zealand natives are also sometimes said to drawl. The word probably stems from the Dutch <i>dralen</i>, "delay" or "linger."</p></div>`;
