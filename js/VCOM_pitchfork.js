If you want to see an image of a <i>pitchfork</i>, just google an image of the famous painting "American Gothic."</p><p class="long">With a pitchfork, a farmer can easily scoop beneath a pile of hay or straw, lift it, and toss it into a pile. Most pitchforks have wooden handles and metal prongs, and they've been around since the Middle Ages. Back then, they were sometimes used as a weapon too. The word <i>pitchfork</i> comes from the "toss or throw" meaning of <i>pitch</i>, plus <i>fork</i>, from the Old English <i>forca</i>, "forked instrument or weapon."</p></div></div>`;
