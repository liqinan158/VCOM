In other words, <i>bye</i> is a shorter way to say, "Goodbye."</p><p class="long">When you need a quick, informal way to bid your friend adieu, you'll probably say, "<i>Bye!</i>" It's shorthand for "goodbye," and when adults speak to babies and children, there's a tendency to double it: "<i>Bye bye</i>!" Another kind of <i>bye</i> is when an athlete moves directly into the next round of a competition without playing, a meaning that originated with the game of cricket.</p></div>`;
