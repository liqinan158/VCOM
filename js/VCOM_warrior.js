This  eventually morphed into the word we know as <i>warrior</i>. The word can also refer to someone fighting a philosophical or political war. Author Carlos Castandeda said, "Nobody is born a warrior, in exactly the same way that nobody is born an average man. We make ourselves into one or the other.‚Äù  After ridding the kitchen of ants, you felt like a proud warrior.</p></div></div>`;
