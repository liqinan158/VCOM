In certain areas, a <i>drought</i> can last for weeks, months, sometimes even years! Forget about running your lawn sprinkler during a drought; the water is needed for drinking, bathing, and toilet flushing.</p><p class="long">Another way <i>drought</i> can be used is to refer to a shortage of something (other than rainfall) that lasts for a long period of time, like a <i>drought</i> in job growth during a recession. Typically a drought is not a good thing and something you hope to avoid. For example, if your friend Kenny hasn't gone on a date in five years, it's safe to say that he is having a romantic <i>drought</i>.</p></div></div>`;
