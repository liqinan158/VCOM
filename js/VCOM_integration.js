When you integrate things, you bring them together. So <i>integration</i> is the act of doing just that, like the integration of African-American students into mixed-race schools after segregation was outlawed in the 1950s, or the integration of computers in businesses that had previously only used paper-based record-keeping.</p></div></div>`;
