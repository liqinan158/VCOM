In the 1960s, civil rights activists combatted the ideas and policies of white <i>supremacists.</i></p><p class="long">The word <i>supremacist</i> first appeared in the mid-20th century in the sense of "white supremacist," and that is still the most common use of the word. <i>Supremacist</i> comes from the word <i>supremacy</i>, "the condition of being superior to all others," and ultimately from the Latin word <i>supremus</i>, "highest." Supremacists believe they are the best, or highest, typically because of their race or ethnicity.</p></div>`;
