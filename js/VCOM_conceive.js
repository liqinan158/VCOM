If you <i>conceive</i> a plan for your little brother's birthday, you dream up the perfect party, complete with a magician, rented ponies, and a cake shaped like a rocket.</p><p class="long">Latin roots for <i>conceive</i> (by way of French) point to "take into" either "the womb" or "the mind." An idea is sometimes called "a seed" or "the seed of an idea," and <i>conceive</i> means to produce something from inside the mind â€” or to become pregnant. Another expression is "pregnant with ideas" or "pregnant with possibilities," and someone who can "<i>conceive</i> of a thousand ways" to solve a problem or design something is full of new ideas.</p></div></div>`;
