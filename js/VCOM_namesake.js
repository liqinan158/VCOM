Less often, the word also means anyone who shares a name with someone else, so you could refer to all the Emmas in your school as namesakes. The first recorded use of the word <i>namesake</i> was in the mid-1600s, and it probably began as the phrase "for the name's sake," before being condensed into a single word.</p></div></div>`;
