Originally designating falling tones especially at the end of lines of music or poetry, <i>cadence</i> broadened to mean the rhythms of the tones and sometimes even the rhythm of sounds in general. Think of the cadence of the marching band at a football game or the cadence of the crickets on a warm spring night. You can remember the "fall" idea by thinking of one of the only words that contains it — <i>decadence</i> — which has the prefix <i>de-</i> at the front to mean down, or downfall.</p></div></div>`;
