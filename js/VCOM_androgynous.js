If you are looking for an <i>androgynous</i> name, for example, choose Pat.</p><p class="long">You can see the meaning of <i>androgynous</i> in its parts: In Greek, <i>andros</i> means "male" and <i>gyn</i> means "female." Someone who is androgynous has both male and female characteristics, and therefore may be mistaken for being a member of the opposite gender. Don't confuse <i>androgynous</i> with <i>unisex</i>, which describes objects or places used by both males and females, like a unisex restroom.</p></div></div>`;
