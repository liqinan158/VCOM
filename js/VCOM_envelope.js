It usually refers to the thing you stick a stamp on and snail mail.</p><p class="long">In the early 1700s, <i>envelope</i>, the noun for "wrapper," evolved from the French <i>enveloppe</i>, meaning “to envelop.” <i>Envelope</i> is always a noun, unlike the verb <i>envelop</i> which means “to wrap, cloak.” Synonyms for <i>envelope</i> range from <i>casing</i> and <i>enclosure</i> to <i>pouch</i> and <i>sheath</i>.
