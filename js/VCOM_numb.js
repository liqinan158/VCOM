After skiing all day, your toes might be <i>numb</i> from the cold. You'd feel <i>numb</i> for hours after hearing that your favorite band broke up.</p><p class="long">People can feel numb in terms of their feelings and emotions. For example, if you've had your heart broken lots of times, you start to become numb â€” the breakups don't upset you so much. <i>Numb</i> can also describe being so frightened that you can't move, like being numb with fear when you saw the bear near your campsite. <i>Numb</i> can also mean "to make insensitive," like when the dentist numbs your gums so you won't feel any pain.</p></div></div>`;
