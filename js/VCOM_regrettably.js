If you forgot that today, May 5th, is your brother's birthday, you might say, "<i>Regrettably</i>, I thought today was the fourth."</p><p class="long"><i>Regrettably</i> is often used at the beginning of a sentence that tells something you wish you had done â€” or hadn't. You can also use it in the middle of a thought to signify sadness, apology, or regret, like when you're lost in the woods with a guide who's <i>regrettably</i> choosing one wrong path after another. <i>Regrettably</i> also describes things that are disappointing, like your regrettably brief career as a fire juggler.</p></div>`;
