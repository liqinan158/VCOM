It can also mean the style in which a project is carried out, like a ballet's creative execution. <i>Execution</i> can also refer to the death of a person, either a prisoner who's been sentenced to death by a court of law, or a deliberate, targeted murder, especially when it's done for political reasons.</p></div></div>`;
