You might love your English teacher's musing responses to students' questions or grow bored by a French film's slow, musing quality. You can also use the word as a noun meaning "period of reflection," although it's most often written as the plural <i>musings</i>: "This book is nothing but the author's musings about his cat."</p></div>`;
