If your brother's Halloween costume is so elaborate that you can't even tell it's him under all that makeup, he's unrecognizable.</p><p class="long">This adjective is often used for things that have been badly damaged: "After the hurricane's destruction, the town was unrecognizable." You can also use it in a more positive way: "Once my bike was repaired and painted it was completely unrecognizable!" <i>Unrecognizable</i> comes from the prefix <i>un-</i>, or "not," and the Latin <i>recognoscere</i>, "recall to mind or know again."</p></div>`;
