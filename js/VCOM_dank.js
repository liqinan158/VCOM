If you have ever visited a cave or an unfinished basement, you know how a <i>dank</i> place feels. Yuck.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>dank</i> is often used to describe places that would have moist or damp walls. A dank cave can provide hundreds of bats shelter, but you probably wouldn't want to visit them. Tunnels can also be choice dank locations: "The tunnel under the harbor was always dank, and the workers constantly had to battle mold and lichen on the tile walls." One way to remember <i>dank</i>'s meaning is to think of <i>dark</i> since they share three letters and seem to go together; a dank place is often a dark one as well.</p></div>`;
