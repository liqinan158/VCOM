Sometimes the word <i>quote</i> is used as shorthand for <i>quotation</i>, a passage of speech or writing that’s repeated word for word.</p><p class="long">As a verb, to <i>quote</i> means to repeat someone’s words, attributing them to their originator. If you’re giving a speech on personal organization, you might want to quote Ben Franklin in it — he’s the master. When you write out a quote, you put the other person’s words in quotation marks (“Aha!”). Sometimes a price estimate is called a quote, like when a mechanic looks at your engine and gives you a quote for the cost of repair.</p></div></div>`;
