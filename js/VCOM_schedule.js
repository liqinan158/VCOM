It is the thing you write down in your planner. If you're a student, you probably have your class <i>schedule</i> memorized within the first few weeks of school.</p><p class="long">This noun derives from Middle English <i>sedule</i> "slip of parchment or paper, note," from Late Latin <i>schedula</i>, from <i>scheda</i> "a strip of papyrus," from Greek <i>schida</i> "a splinter of wood." The modern spelling <i>schedule</i> did not become established until the mid 17th century. And the current American pronunciation, patterned on words such as <i>scheme</i> and <i>school</i>, was not in use until the 19th century.</p></div>`;
