var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">upright</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Something that's <i>upright</i> stands straight up. When you sit <i>upright</i>, your back is straight and vertical. Even your grandmother would approve of your posture.</p><p class="long">Most cars have seats that can fold forward or lean back, and then snap upright, back into a normal sitting position; and when you're in class, you're usually expected to sit upright, facing your teacher at the front of the room. Another way to use <i>upright</i> is to mean "upstanding" or "trustworthy," so if your friend finds a wallet full of money and returns it to its owner, you can call her an <i>upright</i> citizen.</p></div>`;
