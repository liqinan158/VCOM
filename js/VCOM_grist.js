var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">grist</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When grain like wheat or oats is ground into flour, it's called <i>grist</i>. Maize or corn that's made into coarse <i>grist</i> is called "grits." Grits. Yum.</p><p class="long">When grain is prepared for grinding, the grist is separated from the chaff, or the thick seed covering. You may have heard the saying, "It's all <i>grist</i> for the mill." What that basically means is that anything at all can be useful or profitableâ€”or that someone can put a positive spin on anything. It comes from the idea that any grain at all is useful to a miller who grinds it into flour.</p></div></div>`;
