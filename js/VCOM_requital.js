Your friend might insist that no <i>requital</i> is necessary for the cookies she gives you, but you may want to bake cupcakes for her tomorrow anyway.</p><p class="long">Use <i>requital</i> for the sincere return of a favor, like going to your brother's band concert after he's dutifully attended your poetry reading. You can also use it for retribution for a wrong that's been done: "As <i>requital</i> for the Silly String attack, she put a whoopie cushion on her classmate's chair." <i>Requital</i> comes from <i>requite</i>, which is based in the Middle English root <i>quite</i>, "clear or pay up."</p></div>`;
