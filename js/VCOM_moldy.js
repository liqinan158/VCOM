Things become moldy from being stored in dark, damp places or in the case of some food, from not being refrigerated. If you wait months to clean out your locker and throw away your old lunch bags, you might find mold growing on bread crusts, yogurt, or containers of leftover ravioli. Ditch those moldy remnants!</p></div>`;
