Remember the time you knocked the ball out of the park, scoring a home run but breaking a house's window in the process? You had to make <i>restitution</i> for the broken window, paying for its replacement.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>restitution</i> means both "restoring something to its original state" and "returning something to its rightful owner," like a public apology that leads to the restitution of a person's honor and reputation.  <i>Restitution</i> also has a specific legal meaning â€” an order given by a judge to a convicted criminal to make amends for the crime. For example, judges often order people to pay restitution for the damage they cause.</p></div>`;
