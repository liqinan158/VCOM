If your friends are constantly complaining about your <i>arrogance</i>, you might want to lose the haughty attitude and try to be more humble.</p><p class="long"><i>Arrogance</i> comes from the Latin <i>arrogans</i> which means overbearing. If you show arrogance, your pride is overbearing and offensive to others. Arrogance can also be attributed to corporations who fail to take consumer opinion into account and to nations that seem to do whatever they want with no regard for other countries.</p></div>`;
