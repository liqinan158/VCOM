An inspiring speech can <i>galvanize</i> people into making a change.</p><p class="long">The word <i>galvanize</i> was coined to honor the 18th-century scientist Luigi Galvani, who found that a spark could make a frog's legs move. This discovery led to further studies in what Galvani called "animal electricity," and became the basis for Mary Shelley's <i>Frankenstein</i>, (a novel in which a mad scientist attempts to use electricity to galvanize a monster to life). <i>Galvanize</i> also means to cover steel or iron with zinc so it doesnâ€™t rust.</p></div>`;
