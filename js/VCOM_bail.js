When you <i>bail</i> (verb) someone out of jail, you post money, also known as <i>bail</i> (noun), to assure the authorities that person won't try to run away before going to trial.</p><p class="long">As a noun, <i>bail</i> means bond money. This comes from the Middle English word <i>bayle</i>, for "captivity." As a verb, the idea of "bailing out" comes from the later word <i>baile</i>, which means “dipping out,” a meaning you can use when you are trying to empty something flooded.  If your boat has a leak, you should bail it out (then plug the leak).  When you <i>bail</i>, in the colloquial sense, you escape in some way.</p></div>`;
