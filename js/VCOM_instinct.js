Babies cry by <i>instinct</i>, and ducks follow their mother by <i>instinct</i>.</p><p class="long">Animals and humans learn a lot of things from other animals and humans. But if there isn't any learning involved, then the behavior is an instinct. Instincts come naturally, like a baby's desire to feed. Some behaviors are a combination of instinct and learned behavior, like language. Others happen without any teaching at all, like the instinct to run when you see a big, hungry looking bear. When you see the word <i>instinct</i>, think <i>natural response</i>.</p></div>`;
