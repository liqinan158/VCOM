Remember that Elvis had a knack for moving his <i>pelvis</i>, and then you may more easily remember this body part!</p><p class="long">In humans, hip bones make up either side of the pelvis, with the sacrum and coccyx bones at the back. This bony pelvis makes it possible for us to walk upright with jointed legs, and it also forms a protective case for the internal organs that sit low in the body. In Latin, <i>pelvis</i> means "basin," from the Greek <i>pelike</i>, "goblet or bowl."</p></div>`;
