If you are constantly worried that you have a grave illness, you might be suffering from <i>hypochondria</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Hypochondria</i> comes from the Greek <i>hupo</i> meaning "under" and <i>khondros</i> meaning "sternal cartilage." This refers to the soft space under the ribs where the liver, gallbladder and spleen are located. Long ago, people believed that melancholy or sadness came from these organs. A person with hypochondria is convinced that her minor symptoms are signs of a more serious illness.  Often hypochondriacs become paranoid about their health â€” either visiting doctors a lot or avoiding them altogether out of fear.</p></div></div>`;
