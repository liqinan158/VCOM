Your <i>benefaction</i>, volunteering every day and donating monthly, helps your local animal shelter immensely.</p><p class="long">Benefaction is the process or action of benefitting someone, particularly when you're motivated by kindness. When your neighbor is gravely ill and everyone on your street takes turns cooking meals for their family, that's a type of benefaction. Another way to use the word is to mean "donation." Your mom might appreciate it if you give a benefaction to her favorite charity instead of buying her a birthday gift this year.</p></div>`;
