If someone is butting into your business, telling you what you should do, they're giving unsolicited advice. Junk mail is unsolicited. Phone calls trying to sell you something are unsolicited. <i>Unsolicited</i> seems negative, but it can be used positively. If you give compliments that are unsolicited, then you offer them spontaneously and honestly â€” that's something people like.</p></div>`;
