You can also call an <i>entr'acte</i> an intermission â€” and it's a good time to stretch your legs or check your text messages.</p><p class="long">This theatrical word comes from the French <i>entre</i>, "between," and <i>acte</i>, "act," giving it the literal meaning "between the acts." It works as a synonym for "intermission," or the Italian "intermezzo," but it's also used for the music that's played during an intermission or scene change. In musical theatre, an entr'acte works as a melodic introduction or overture for the next act.</p></div></div>`;
