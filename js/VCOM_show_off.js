var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">show off</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you boast or brag about something, you <i>show off</i>. If you insist on spelling difficult words all through dinner, even though the spelling bee is over, your little brother might accuse you of <i>showing off</i>.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>show off</i> often has a negative connotation, so if your friend asks why you always show off, it's not a compliment. When people show off, they generally go overboard flaunting their skill or accomplishments: "It's great he won that award, but why did he have to show off about it?" Sometimes this phrase simply means "display proudly," though, like when a kid shows off their brand new roller skating skills.</p></div>`;
