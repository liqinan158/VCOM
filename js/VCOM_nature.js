You might notice the frantic nature of a political debate, or you might question the nature of your brother's friendships. <i>Nature</i> can also refer to the physical world made up of plants and animals: what you think of as "the great outdoors." You might be a nature lover who enjoys hiking. <i>Nature</i> can also describe natural forces, such as the destructive elements of nature, like a tsunami or a tornado.</p></div>`;
