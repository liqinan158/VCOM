Soda poured over ice in a glass effervesces, and waves on a beach sometimes effervesce as they break, leaving tiny bubbles on the sand. Things that are bubbly or carbonated are <i>effervescent</i> â€” and both words come from a Latin root, <i>effervescere</i>, "to boil up or boil over," combining <i>ex</i>, "out," and <i>fervescere</i>, "begin to boil."</p></div></div>`;
