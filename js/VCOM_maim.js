Wartime battles have a tendency to <i>maim</i> soldiers.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>maim</i> is related to <i>mayhem</i>, which, historically, was the act of hurting another person so badly that they couldn’t defend themselves. To maim a person or animal, even if it’s an accident, is to render them defenseless or disfigured, and it frequently includes the loss of a limb. The goal of driving defensively is to avoid an accident that could maim you, your passengers, or other people on the road.</p></div></div>`;
