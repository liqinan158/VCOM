If you’re leaving a job after being there a long time, your co-workers might throw you a farewell party. <i>Farewell</i> is an expression, like "goodbye," but also a noun — if you like to leave without a lot of fuss, you don’t like long farewells. <i>Farewell</i> is a combination of <i>fare</i> and <i>well</i>. <i>Fare</i> comes from the Old English word <i>faran</i>, which means "to journey."</p></div>`;
