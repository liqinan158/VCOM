In some parts of Britain, the word <i>scullery</i> is still used to mean "kitchen," although few people would claim to employ a "<i>scullery</i> maid," or a low-ranking member of a household staff. The root of the word is in doubt, but it probably comes from the Latin word for wooden platter, <i>scutra</i>, or the Old Norse <i>skola</i>, "to wash."</p></div></div>`;
