The term <i>undertow</i> isn't really accurate, since these currents won't pull you under the water. A figurative meaning of <i>undertow</i> is "underlying mood or feeling." For example, your festive birthday party might have an undertow of sadness if your best friend didn't show up.</p></div></div>`;
