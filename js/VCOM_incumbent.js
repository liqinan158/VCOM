It was first used in English for someone holding a church office, and then someone holding any office. You'll most likely hear it today for political officials. In a race for mayor, the incumbent mayor faces a challenger. <i>Incumbent</i> also means "required by obligation." It is incumbent upon you to do the dishes.</p></div></div>`;
