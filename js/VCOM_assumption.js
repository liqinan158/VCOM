For example, people might make the <i>assumption</i> that you're a nerd if you wear glasses, even though that's not true. Or very nice.</p><p class="long">From the Latin <i>assumptionem</i>, meaning “a taking or receiving,” <i>assumption</i> was recorded circa 1300 as a noun describing “the reception of the Virgin Mary into heaven.” The word later shook its religious roots and developed into the noun we hear more often today, usually when a person takes something for granted or literally takes possession of something.</p></div></div>`;
