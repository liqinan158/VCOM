When you eat at an Indian restaurant, you can ask for extra <i>chutney</i> on the side.</p><p class="long">Some chutneys resemble jam — and, in fact, many types are made with fruit that's been cooked or pickled in vinegar, lemon, or tamarind, and often sugar. Other chutney is made with vegetables and flavored with various spices. European chutneys tend to be sweet, while in India they're just as likely to be very hot and spicy. The word <i>chutney</i> has a Sanskrit root, <i>caṭnī</i>, "to lick."</p></div></div>`;
