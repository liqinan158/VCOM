Young girls are traditionally dolled up in <i>pink</i> outfits, until they eventually rebel and refuse to wear pink as tweens.</p><p class="long">The color pink varies from a soft, pastel shade to a bold, bright one â€” but they're all a lighter version of red, or red with some white added. Many flowers are pink, and there are even a few known as <i>pinks</i>, or <i>garden pinks</i>. If your doctor tells you you're "in the <i>pink</i>" after your checkup, she means you're very healthy. The word began as the flower name, probably from Dutch, in which <i>pink</i> means "small."</p></div></div>`;
