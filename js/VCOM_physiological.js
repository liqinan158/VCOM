That root comes from the Greek word for nature. Add the suffix <i>ology</i>, which means "the study of" (see where we're going?), and finally, tack on that little <i>ical</i>. Ta-taa! You have turned the root into an adjective to describe the way your body works. Let's get <i>physiological</i>!</p></div></div>`;
