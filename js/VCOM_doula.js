Most <i>doulas</i> provide support before or after childbirth as well.</p><p class="long">Unlike a midwife, nurse, or doctor, a doula doesn't have a medical role in childbirth, but is there to give expectant parents whatever kind of support they need. A doula might answer questions and provide information before the birth, rub a woman's back while she's in labor, and give advice about parenting concerns. Death doulas provide a similar type of support to patients at the end of their lives.</p></div></div>`;
