var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">apprise</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>apprise</i> someone about something is to fill them in, to give them the scoop. If someone in your immediate family wins the mega-bucks lottery, you want to be the first one to be <i>apprised</i> of that event!</p><p class="long">Don't confuse the verbs <i>apprise</i> and <i>appraise</i>. <i>Appraise</i> means to determine the value of something â€” either its quality or its monetary worth. <i>Apprise</i>, on the other hand, means to inform or make aware. This word has a rather formal, weighty tone. Presidents get apprised of foreign affairs, but you will most likely not get apprised of weather conditions or dinner plans.</p></div>`;
