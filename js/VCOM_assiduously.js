If you <i>assiduously</i> count your lemonade stand earnings, you tally up the dimes and quarters very carefully, possibly counting them twice to make sure you get it right.</p><p class="long">Diligence, care, thoroughness, precision — all of these describe what's needed to do something <i>assiduously</i>. It comes from the Latin word <i>assiduus</i>, which means "busy, incessant, continual, or constant." The people who shelf books at your local library do so assiduously — they take great care to put the books exactly where they belong in the stacks so that others can find them.</p></div></div>`;
