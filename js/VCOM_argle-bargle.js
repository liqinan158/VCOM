If you ask a politician and she responds in a confusing, absurd way, you can say her answer is nothing but <i>argle-bargle</i>.</p><p class="long">It's more common to hear the word <i>argle-bargle</i> in Britain than in the US, but wherever you are, it's a great way to refer to gibberish or foolish talk. You can also use the word to mean an argument or a quarrel. <i>Argle-bargle</i> comes from the 1580s word <i>argle</i>, "to argue obstinately," which might be a combination of <i>argue</i> and <i>haggle</i>. The variation <i>argy-bargy</i> comes from a Scottish rhyme.</p></div>`;
