It can also be the sound itself. Want to hear a <i>screech</i>? Take a little kid’s lollipop away.</p><p class="long">A screech is another word for a scream, shriek, or cry. It’s not fun to listen to. If a woman in a horror movie finds a bad guy in her closet, she’ll probably screech. If you surprise someone in the middle of the night, expect a screech. Things can also screech, like when a car screeches to a sudden stop at a red light.</p></div></div>`;
