Usually, these earthly worries have to do with material things, like jobs, money, cars, and houses â€” rather than spiritual concerns like love, faith, and beauty. The word <i>earth</i> is at the root of <i>earthly</i>, and you can think of it as "things that only matter to humans on the Earth."</p></div>`;
