var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">pullover</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>pullover</i> is a sweater or sweatshirt that you put on over your head. Don't forget your wool <i>pullover</i> â€” it's cold outside!</p><p class="long">You can refer to a jacket as a pullover if you put it on by pulling it over your head, rather than zipping or buttoning it up. The same goes for any other garment, no matter its materials. Pulling it on over your head makes it qualify as a pullover. Originally, a <i>pullover</i> was a type of shoe, and today it's still the name for a shoe prototype, a sample used by shoemakers to check the fit.</p></div>`;
