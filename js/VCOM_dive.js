You might dare your friend to <i>dive</i> off a boat into a cold lake.</p><p class="long">When you dive, you plunge into a pool or other body of water. A bird or airplane also dives when it descends suddenly. The plunge or drop itself is also a <i>dive</i>: "When the plane went into a <i>dive</i> I had to close my eyes." Since 1871, <i>dive</i> has also been used informally for a low-rent or slightly dangerous bar, possibly from the idea that descending to a basement-level establishment involved a "dive" of sorts.</p></div>`;
