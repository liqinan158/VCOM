While one octogenarian might live in an assisted living residence and use a wheelchair, plenty of octogenarian folks drive their own cars and live in houses or apartments. Just like teenagers or thirty-somethings, octogenarians don't necessarily have much in common with each other aside from their age.</p></div></div>`;
