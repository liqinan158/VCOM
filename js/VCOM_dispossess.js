var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">dispossess</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you take something away from someone, especially land or property, you <i>dispossess</i> them of it. Your parents might <i>dispossess</i> you of the tent you pitched in the yard to set up the grill for their upcoming cookout.</p><p class="long">At the heart of <i>dispossess</i> is the verb <i>possess</i>, which you may think of as meaning "to own," but which also means "to occupy" or "to hold as real estate." When people are deprived of their property or possessions, they are dispossessed. In fact, the verb <i>dispossess</i> is sometimes used in place of the more direct <i>evict</i>. If a homeowner misses too many mortgage payments, the bank may dispossess them, forcing them to move out.</p></div>`;
