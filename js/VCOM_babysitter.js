A dad might hire a <i>babysitter</i> to watch his daughters while he goes to his yoga class.</p><p class="long">A babysitter usually spends an evening or an afternoon at someone's house, playing with or caring for kids while their parents are away. While a nanny is more of a full-time, long-term childcare worker, a babysitter works once in a while, for just an evening or an afternoon, and often for several different families. The word <i>babysitter</i>, or <i>baby-sitter</i>, was first used in 1937, and some people use the shortened form, <i>sitter</i>.</p></div></div>`;
