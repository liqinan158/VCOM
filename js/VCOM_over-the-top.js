Your sister's outfit can be described as over-the-top if she is wearing a sequinned dress, a feather boa, and a black silk top hat. The gift you give your fourth grade teacher is also over-the-top if it's two tickets to a Broadway play and a diamond ring. When something's over-the-top, it's a little outrageous.</p></div></div>`;
