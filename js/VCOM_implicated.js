The word is often used in a negative sense, suggesting an involvement in something wrong, with the person being <i>implicated</i> by the facts of the case.</p><p class="long">The Latin word <i>implicātus</i>, which means "folded in," is the past participle of <i>implicāre</i>, meaning to interweave ideas or objects. In the 17th century, the word referred to a general entanglement in a complicated situation. By 1797, the definition had come to focus on the idea of criminal involvement, suggesting someone "folded in," or involved, in a crime or scandal. Today, the word <i>implicated</i> is not necessarily tied to crime, but it's generally negative.</p></div></div>`;
