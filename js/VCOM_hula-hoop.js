Some experts can get several <i>hula-hoops</i> spinning at the same time.</p><p class="long">Twirling a hula-hoop around your waist is fun, and it's also good exercise. Hoops have been used as playthings for centuries, but the hula-hoop was invented in 1958. The toy made from plastic tubing was based on traditional hoops made of rattan or bamboo, and it was wildly popular. At one point, the manufacturer produced 50,000 hula-hoops a day. The word <i>hula</i> was used because the hip movements were seen as similar to the Hawaiian hula dance.</p></div>`;
