That image comes from the most familiar use of the word, which was to name an order of angels.</p><p class="long">The image we have of a <i>cherub</i>, chubby-cheeked babies with wings, actually wasn't around until the Renaissance, when artists depicted the lower-order angels as children. Prior to that, the word evolved from the Hebrew <i>kĕrūḇ</i>, and was taken from the Aramaic <i>kĕ-raḇyā</i> which meant "child-like." It was this translation that encouraged the idea of a cherub as being portrayed as a child. The plural form, "cherubim" also follows the Hebrew grammar rule of creating plurals by adding the suffix <i>-im</i>.</p></div></div>`;
