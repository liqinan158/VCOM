When you <i>upbraid</i> people, you scold them, tell them off, and criticize them.

Although this word doesn't have anything to do with hair, <i>upbraid</i> and <i>braid</i> are, in fact, related.  The original meaning of <i>braid</i> was "to move quickly from side to side," which is what you do with your fingers when you're braiding someone's hair.  When you upbraid someone, you're quickly bringing up different reasons why you're mad at them.</p></div></div>`;
