You're more likely to see a <i>lunette</i> in a cathedral than in your own home.</p><p class="long">During battles, military lunettes gave protection to troops taking cover behind them â€” they were temporary forts, curved into a protective shape and placed near but outside the main fortification. The curved window or opening also called a <i>lunette</i> is most often found in large structures like the Sistine Chapel and the Library of Congress. In Middle French, <i>lunette</i> means "little moon."</p></div>`;
