But hosting also has an ickier side: In biology, a <i>host</i> is an animal, plant or person that provides a home for another organism — like a parasite. <i>Host</i> also functions as a noun, meaning a multitude, horde, or great number. As in, "You will pick up a host of funky germs from drinking the water in rural India."</p></div>`;
