If you watch a parade with a long line of floats traveling one after another down the street, that's a <i>caravan</i> of floats.</p><p class="long">The word <i>caravan</i> comes from the Persian <i>karwan</i> meaning "group of desert travelers." A caravan can be a large group of people traveling together in one long line. It's also the term used for a camper that has a living area in it.  In history, pilgrims often traveled like this, lugging all of their belongings with them in caravans, or covered horse-drawn carriages. It's also a verb: caravan with your neighbors on a group road trip.</p></div>`;
