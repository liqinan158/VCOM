A cold burst of wind, a swig or a serving of a drink, the act of pulling a heavy load, and the depth of a ship below the surface of the water: each of these can be called a draught. It's easy to confuse the British <i>draught</i> with <i>drought</i>, which means "a shortage of rainfall" and rhymes with "out."</p></div></div>`;
