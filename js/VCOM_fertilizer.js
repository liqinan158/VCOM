If your rosebushes are looking a little sad, you might want to try using <i>fertilizer</i>.</p><p class="long">To <i>fertilize</i> is to make something fertile, or to encourage it to grow or reproduce. These words, along with <i>fertilizer</i>, come from the Latin <i>fertilis</i>, "bearing in abundance, fruitful, or productive." The most common kind of organic fertilizer is animal manure or peat, and other fertilizers are made of specific nutrients like nitrogen or potassium. Fertilizers are usually solid, though they come in liquid form as well.</p></div>`;
