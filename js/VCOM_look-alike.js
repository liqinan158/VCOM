Running into your <i>look-alike</i> in a big city would be quite shocking.</p><p class="long">Some look-alikes are related, like identical twins or cousins who resemble each other to an uncanny degree. Other look-alikes are so similar to celebrities that they can make a living impersonating them. If you are a Michael Jackson look-alike, you could dress like the singer and perform at a talent show, lip syncing his song "Billie Jean" and attempting the moonwalk. <i>Look-alike</i> is an American word, coined around 1937.</p></div></div>`;
