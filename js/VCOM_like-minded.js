If youâ€™re really into kittens but all your friends like dogs, go to the cat show to meet <i>like-minded</i> people. Then you can chat about kittens all day long.</p><p class="long">Like-minded people stick together. If you love jousting, you might go to a Renaissance Faire to meet like-minded people. If you love Henry VIII, you might find like-minded friends to eat giant turkey legs with. If most of the citizens of your city agree about politics, it won't be surprising that your like-minded mayor is easily re-elected. Like-minded people get along.</p></div>`;
