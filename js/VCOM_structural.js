While we all look different on the outside, for the most part, we all share the same structural components â€” we're built the same way. Some buildings, such as the Eiffel Tower, reveal their structural design completely. They are nothing but structure. Other buildings work hard to hide their structural qualities. You can discuss the <i>structural</i> nature of ideas too, as in "<i>structural</i> economics" or even human relationships.</p></div></div>`;
