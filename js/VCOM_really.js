If your ring is <i>really</i> pure gold, does that mean he <i>really</i> likes you?</p><p class="long">Although the actual origin of <i>really</i> is unknown, it was first used in the 15th Century in the Eucharist, referring to the actual presence of Christ, and that definition holds today. Another use of the word, that of a questioning interjection ("Oh, really?"), was first recorded in 1815 and carries with it a sense of disbelief.  Oh, really?  You're late to work because the bus was attacked by a pack of wild boars?  Do you really expect your boss to believe that?</p></div></div>`;
