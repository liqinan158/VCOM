This word is stronger than just <i>sad</i> — <i>morose</i> implies being extremely gloomy and depressed. We all can be morose at times, like after the death of a friend or family member. Whether you're morose due to an event or just because you're feeling blue, you should try skipping or whistling a little tune to perk things up.</p></div></div>`;
