Instead, a <i>horseshoe</i> is an arc-shaped piece of metal that gets nailed into the horse's hoof.</p><p class="long">Ever since humans started using horses for riding, pulling carts, and working on farms, they've found ways to guard their hooves against wear and injury. Horseshoes can be nailed onto the thick, fingernail-like hoof, or glued on. Some people consider horseshoes to be lucky symbols as well, while others enjoy the game called <i>horseshoes</i>, which involves throwing large horseshoes toward a metal stake in the ground.</p></div>`;
