When a drought ruins a farmer's crop and he has nothing to harvest, his bad luck may leave him and his family impoverished, or poor.</p><p class="long">The Latin prefix <i>in-</i> is changed to <i>im</i> when in front of a word starting with the letter p-, but its meaning "in" or "into" stays the same. With roots in the French word <i>povre</i> meaning "poor," <i>impoverish</i> means to make poor or drive someone "into poverty."
