A <i>funicular</i> is pulled by a moving cable and involves complex, counterbalanced movements of the cars.</p><p class="long">It's a coincidence that the word <i>fun</i> is in <i>funicular</i>, though riding a funicular would likely be very fun indeed: it's a railway that goes up a mountain. The real origin of the word has to do with ropes, cables, and pulleys and the complex way these devices are used to move things: such processes were called <i>funicular</i>. From there, <i>funicular</i> became the name of a train that used a similar cable-operated system to move.</p></div>`;
