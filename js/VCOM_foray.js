If you're in the army, that's a literal excursion into enemy territory. For the rest of us, it means trying something out. "My <i>foray</i> into rugby ended with my spending a week in the hospital."</p><p class="long">This word derives from the Latin <i>fuerre</i> 'straw', which led into Old French as <i>fourager</i> 'forage,' or search for food. Think of soldiers stealing food from the enemy as maybe how this word first came to be used. Even if that is historically inaccurate, your <i>foray</i> into amateur word-sleuthing will help you remember this word.</p></div></div>`;
