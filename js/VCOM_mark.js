When you <i>mark</i> something, you leave a mark on it, check it off, cross it out, or label it. You can also mark something by noticing or acknowledging it: "Let's <i>mark</i> your birthday with a big party!" Shopkeepers mark prices on goods, and a "<i>mark</i> down" is a reduction in price.</p></div></div>`;
