A corrupt government is one kind of <i>scourge</i>, and a plague of insects that destroys a farmer's crops is another kind of <i>scourge</i>.</p><p class="long">Dating from the 13th century, <i>scourge</i> originally meant "a whip used as punishment." It wasn't long until the figurative meaning of "something causing pain or misery" became even more common. A scourge tends to be something that causes folks to suffer terribly, whether it's a tsunami or unjust laws. You can also use this word as a verb: "Cutting the city's transportation budget will do nothing but scourge people without cars."</p></div>`;
