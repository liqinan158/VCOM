City dwellers commonly accuse those who live in the country of narrow-minded <i>provincialism</i>.</p><p class="long">Talking about someone's provincialism is fairly derogatory and critical â€” the word implies a view of the world that is very small and cut off from the wider world. You're most likely to be seen as having this trait if you're from the suburbs or a rural area.
