You're outdoing yourself, exceeding expectations, and overcoming the task at hand.</p><p class="long">This word comes to us from the Old French verb for <i>mount</i>, or climb. Maria sang "climb every mountain..." in The Sound of Music. But she could have just as well meant "<i>surmount</i> every obstacle" â€” because to <i>surmount</i> means to both reach the highest point of something, like a mountain, and to totally overcome a mountain-size problem.</p></div>`;
