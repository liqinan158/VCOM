You can also rinse your mouth out, either with water or mouthwash. When it's a noun, <i>rinse</i> means the act of rinsing, or a hair treatment: "After the red <i>rinse</i>, you'll barely recognize yourself." <i>Rinse</i> shares the Latin root <i>recens</i>, "fresh or new," with <i>recent</i>.</p></div>`;
