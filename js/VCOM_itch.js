If you're allergic to poison ivy and you go hiking through a field of it, you'll have a terrible <i>itch</i> all over your legs.</p><p class="long">Sometimes people confuse <i>itch</i> and <i>scratch</i>. An itch is the sensation that causes you to scratch, and when <i>itch</i> is a verb, it either means "to feel or sense an <i>itch</i>," or "to have a strong, restless urge," as when you itch to try out your uncle's motorcycle. Somehow, the word <i>itch</i> arose from its Old English root <i>gicce</i>, or <i>gycce</i>, "an itch."</p></div>`;
