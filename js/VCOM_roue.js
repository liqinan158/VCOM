You could also call him a lady's man, a rake, or a Lothario.</p><p class="long">This one deserves a full etymology: it's French, a participle of <i>rouer</i>, "to break on the wheel," and it's also the name first applied to the profligate companions of the Duc d'Orl√©ans. So in other words, a <i>roue</i> is a really bad dude. <i>Roue</i> is not common in conversation but that didn't stop Oscar Hammerstein from lyricizing it in "The Sound of Music:" "Eager young lads and roues and cads / Will offer you food and wine."</p></div>`;
