A <i>seat belt</i> is the strap you buckle over your lap or shoulder that keeps you secure in a car, airplane, or even a roller coaster.</p><p class="long">A seat belt is sometimes called a <i>safety belt</i>. In 24 states, you're legally required to wear a seat belt, even in the back seat. Other vehicles also have seat belts — when travelling in an airplane, you need to fasten your seat belt during takeoff and landing, and when the plane experiences turbulence.
