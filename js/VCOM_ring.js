And if you've ever ordered onion rings, you know that they're circle-shaped slices of onion that are battered, fried, and eaten with ketchup. Then there's the ring, usually made of silver or gold, that's worn as jewelry on a finger. As a verb, to <i>ring</i> is to form a circle, as in the children's song and game "<i>Ring</i> Around the Rosie."</p></div>`;
