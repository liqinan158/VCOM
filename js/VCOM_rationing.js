During World War Two, Americans participated in the <i>rationing</i> of food, gasoline, and other materials.</p><p class="long">When something is in short supply, like rubber and metal during the Second World War, a government will often institute rationing to save that material, making sure there's enough of it for emergencies. Rationing during the war meant that people had a specific amount of food they could buy each week, and once an item was used up, they had to wait until they got a new ration book to buy more. <i>Ration</i> means "hand out in fixed amounts."</p></div></div>`;
