It's not a natural disaster â€” like an earthquake or a volcano; a <i>fiasco</i> is usually the result of human failure.</p><p class="long"><i>Fiasco</i> comes from the Italian term that means "to make a bottle." How it came to describe an utter, embarrassing, disaster in the English language is still unknown. Today, you'll hear <i>fiasco</i> used in situations that have gone so horribly awry that they are almost laughable, like the Thanksgiving dinner fiasco in which the turkey burnt to a crisp, the dog ate all the side dishes, and everyone had to eat frozen pizza instead.</p></div></div>`;
