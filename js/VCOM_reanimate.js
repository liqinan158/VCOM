A new lead singer might be just the thing your band needs to <i>reanimate</i> its concerts.</p><p class="long">You can reanimate someone in a literal way by giving them CPR after a heart attack â€” and you can also reanimate them more figuratively, simply by getting them excited about a fun weekend plan. Even if your friend is half asleep on a Monday morning in math class, the idea of a Saturday at the amusement park might be enough to reanimate her. The Latin root <i>animare</i> means "give breath to" and "endow with spirit."</p></div>`;
