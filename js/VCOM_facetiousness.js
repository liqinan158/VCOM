Your <i>facetiousness</i> might make it hard for your friends to take you seriously.</p><p class="long">A stand-up comedian's facetiousness can be seen in her tendency to be sarcastic, or to playfully joke about serious issues. The facetiousness of a play might make critics describe it as a farce or a parody. Facetiousness can come across as lighthearted humor, but it can also be a little bit inappropriate or bitterly ironic. <i>Facetiousness</i> comes from the French <i>fac√©tie</i>, "a joke," with its Latin root word, <i>facetia</i>, "jest or witticism."</p></div>`;
