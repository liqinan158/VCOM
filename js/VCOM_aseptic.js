Hospitals make every effort to keep operating rooms <i>aseptic</i> so that patients don’t contract infections after surgery.</p><p class="long">The prefix “a-” almost always means that a word means the opposite of its base. The adjective <i>aseptic</i>, “a-” plus the root “septic,” describes anything that is not septic or is without sepsis. The origin of septic is the Greek word <i>septikos</i> meaning “characterized by putrefaction.” Putrefaction is the rot that happens to flesh after it dies, and when something is <i>aseptic</i> it is free of any rot, filth, bacteria or viruses that could cause disease or death.</p></div></div>`;
