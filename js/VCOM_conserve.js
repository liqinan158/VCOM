People are also encouraged to <i>conserve</i> energy by turning off lights and not cranking the air conditioner.</p><p class="long"><i>Conserve</i> is from the Latin for "to keep, preserve, guard" (<i>conservare</i>). <i>Con</i> means "together," so "together" we can "serve" the planet by not doing doughnuts in the wetlands on our jet skis. You can <i>conserve</i> the planet or a little something for yourself â€”  you might conserve hot water so you can wash your hair later, or try to conserve your old bedroom when you go off to college (and your mom is ready for a home office).</p></div></div>`;
