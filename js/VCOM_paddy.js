If you plan on farming a rice paddy, you'll probably want to invest in a good pair of waterproof boots.</p><p class="long">There are a few kinds of rice that can grow in dry soil, but most need the soggy soil that a paddy provides. Most rice paddies are located in various parts of Asia, although they can also be found in Spain, Haiti, and the state of California. Another meaning of this word is "unmilled rice." The Malay root of <i>paddy</i> is <i>padi</i>, "rice in the straw."</p></div></div>`;
