If your dance moves bring to mind a marionette being jerked around by a five-year-old but you jump on the dance floor anyway, you could be considered <i>dauntless</i>.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>dauntless</i> is a variant of the noun <i>daunt</i>, which means "to intimidate or cause fear."  Both words are related to another family of "D" words — <i>dominate</i>, <i>domestic</i>, <i>domain</i>.  They all go back to the Latin root <i>domare</i>, which means "to tame."  If you're dauntless, it means you're like a tiger or a wild horse — you can't be dominated or tamed.</p></div>`;
