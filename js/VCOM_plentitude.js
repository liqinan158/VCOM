So whenever there's plentitude, there's plenty of something, whether it's a plentitude of sunny days in your summer or a plentitude of pillows on your comfy bed. Despite its kinship with <i>plenty</i>, this word is actually more commonly spelled without the first <i>t</i>, as <i>plenitude</i>.</p></div>`;
