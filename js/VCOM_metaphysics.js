If you have ever contemplated your own existence in the universe, you were dabbling in <i>metaphysics</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Metaphysics</i> comes from the Greek <i>meta ta physika</i> ("the works after the Physics"), which refers those of Aristotle's writings that followed the natural sciences. This field of inquiry was later understood as "the science of things transcending what is physical and natural," like the existence of god or the origin of human knowledge. Metaphysics must therefore rely on philosophical logic, rather than scientific experiments, in exploring these questions.</p></div>`;
