When plants <i>mutate</i>, their genes change in a way that makes them look, grow, or reproduce differently.</p><p class="long">The word <i>mutate</i> comes up most often in biology, to describe the natural — or artificial — process of genetic change. If a scientist alters an animal’s DNA, for example, it mutates. Another way that scientists mutate organisms is in food production: often the genes in a plant are changed in a way that helps it resist insects or weeds, or makes it grow much larger than normal. The Latin root word of <i>mutate</i> is <i>mutare</i>, which simply means "to change."</p></div></div>`;
