If you wrestle with big questions involving the meaning of life, you may be having an <i>existential</i> crisis.</p><p class="long"><i>Existential</i> can also relate to existence in a more concrete way. For instance, the objections of your mother-in-law may pose an existential threat to the continuation of your Friday night card game. Often the word carries at least a nodding reference to the philosophy of existentialism associated with Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Sartre, and others, which emphasizes the individual as a free agent responsible for his actions.</p></div>`;
