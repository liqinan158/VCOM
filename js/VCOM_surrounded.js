On TV shows, you'll often hear police officers say to a criminal: "Come out with your hands up. You're surrounded!" If a criminal is surrounded, then the police have every exit covered — there are police on all sides. If you look closely at <i>surrounded</i>, you'll see <i>round</i> in it — just picture that round circle trapping someone in, and you will remember the meaning of <i>surrounded</i>.</p></div></div>`;
