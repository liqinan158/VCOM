Nervous parents might worry that someone will <i>kidnap</i> their children, and not let them play outside alone.</p><p class="long">The original meaning of <i>kidnap</i>, dating from the late seventeenth century, was "steal children to provide servants to the American colonies," from <i>kid</i>, "child," and <i>nap</i>, "snatch away." After the particularly notorious Lindberg baby kidnapping in 1932, the U.S. Congress passed a law allowing the FBI to investigate all kidnappings. Today the word <i>kidnap</i> includes all abductions, of both children and adults.</p></div></div>`;
