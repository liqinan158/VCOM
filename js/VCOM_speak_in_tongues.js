To speak in tongues, according to these believers, is to speak an actual unknown language sometimes called "the language of the angels." The Christian Bible mentions speaking in tongues in several places/ Language experts call this phenomenon <i>glossolalia</i>, from the Greek roots <i>glōssa</i>, "language" or "tongue," and <i>lalia</i>, "speech."</p></div>`;
