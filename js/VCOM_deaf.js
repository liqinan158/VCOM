People who have been deaf their whole lives and are actively involved with the deaf community consider deafness a "difference in experience," not a disability. When someone accuses you of being "<i>deaf</i> to" their argument, they mean that you are refusing to pay attention or listen. Until the 18th century, <i>deaf</i> was pronounced so it rhymed with <i>beef</i>.</p></div>`;
