Some triptychs are made up of three carved panels, sometimes connected to each other with hinges. The Greek root word, <i>triptykhos</i>, "three-layered," comes from <i>tri</i>, which means "three," and <i>ptykhos</i>, "fold or layer" in Greek. A related artistic term is <i>diptych</i>, which means two panels.</p></div></div>`;
