Joists are usually made of wood, although they can also be concrete or steel, materials strong enough to provide support. Ceiling joists often connect to beams, which tend to be larger and run perpendicular to joists. <i>Joist</i> comes from the Old French word <i>giste</i>, "beam supporting a bridge," from the Latin <i>iacere</i>, "to rest."</p></div></div>`;
