A person can get lost in the unfamiliar, winding streets of a strange city. You can also describe someone as lost if they're confused or desperately in need of some kind of help. The origins of the word <i>lost</i> come from the Proto-Indo-European <i>leu</i>, "to loosen, untie, or separate". The meaning "to be defeated," like when you've lost a game or lost a battle, came later, around 1530.</p></div></div>`;
