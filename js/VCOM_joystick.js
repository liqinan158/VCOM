If you want your character to move left, you generally move the <i>joystick</i> to the left.</p><p class="long">Originally, a joystick was the control an airplane pilot uses to adjust the movements of the plane â€” by moving the joystick back and forth, the pilot adjusts the roll, and moving it up and down controls the pitch of the plane's nose. <i>Joystick</i> was aviators' slang for this lever, and the makers of the earliest video games, in the 1970s, adopted the word for their similarly-shaped control.</p></div>`;
