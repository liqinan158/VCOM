Men had better sleep with one eye to avoid this legendary seductress who takes advantage of them.</p><p class="long">First used in the late 14th century, the noun <i>succubus</i> has origins in the Late Latin word <i>succubare</i>, meaning to "lie under." This is exactly what a succubus might do to men as she engages in sexual intercourse as they sleep. This female demon of the sleep first appeared in medieval folklore and has taken on many forms, ranging from beautiful enchantress to a ghastly supernatural being portrayed in literature, film, music, and video games.</p></div></div>`;
