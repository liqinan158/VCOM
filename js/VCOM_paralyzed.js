Some accidents and illnesses can cause <i>paralyzed</i> muscles, and some emotional traumas may make you feel <i>paralyzed</i> to move on with your life.</p><p class="long">A car crash can leave a driver paralyzed, while a stroke might result in a paralyzed left arm and difficulty speaking. This adjective can also describe something (other than a person's body) that's halted or frozen, like a paralyzed subway system during a hurricane.
