The word <i>punt</i> can be used as both a noun and a verb: "She could <i>punt</i> that ball half way across the field like it was nothing." The root of <i>punt</i> is probably the word <i>bunt</i>, a dialectical variation from the Midlands in England that means "to butt or push with the head."</p></div></div>`;
