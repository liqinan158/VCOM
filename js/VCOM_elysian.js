While it might seem at first like a place a tourist might want to see, don’t try to book airline tickets! Although the term is now often equated with a paradise, the Greek Elysian Fields were a heavenly resting place to go in the afterlife. The concept was probably originally conceived to encourage valor in soldiers during battle. Nowadays, people tend to use <i>elysian</i> to describe any heavenly scene — even a golf resort or a spa.</p></div></div>`;
