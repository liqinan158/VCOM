If something is introduced into a larger whole, like when you add a set of sit-ups to your work-out routine, you can say it is <i>incorporated</i>.</p><p class="long">You may recognize part of the Latin root <i>corpus</i>, meaning "body," in this English word. Essentially, <i>incorporated</i> means "formed or added into a body." This word is often used when new elements have been added to something that already existed, like when new clothes are incorporated into a person's old wardrobe. On a slightly different track, <i>incorporated</i> can also be used when a corporation, or company, is formed.</p></div></div>`;
