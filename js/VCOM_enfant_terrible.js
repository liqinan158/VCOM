Many <i>enfants terribles</i> are successful or famous, which they may think excuses their behavior.</p><p class="long">The phrase <i>enfant terrible</i> literally means "terrible child" in French, and originally this is the way it was used in English too â€” to describe a badly-behaved child whose speech tends to be so direct and candid that he embarrasses his parents. The meaning changed over time to mean an artistically successful person who behaves like a spoiled child.</p></div>`;
