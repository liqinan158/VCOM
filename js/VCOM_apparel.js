Hopefully the <i>apparel</i> you wear to work — suits and heels — is very different from the <i>apparel</i> you wear on the weekends — pajama pants and bunny slippers.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>apparel</i> got its start from the Latin <i>apparare</i>, meaning to “prepare, make ready,” or <i>ad-particulare</i>, meaning “to put things together.” In the mid 13th century it evolved into a verb meaning “to equip.” It wasn’t until the next century that people began to use <i>apparel</i> as both a verb meaning “to attire” and as a noun meaning garments or clothing. Said 17th century British writer Thomas Fuller, “…<i>Apparel</i> shapes: but it's money that finishes the man.”</p></div>`;
