You might nostalgically talk about the town where you used to live as your home of <i>yesteryear</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>yesteryear</i> was actually invented by a poet, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, in 1870. Rossetti was searching for an accurate way to translate a phrase by the French poet Francois Villon â€” the line he came up with was "But where are the snows of yesteryear?" Other translators have substituted <i>yore</i> for <i>yesteryear</i>, but the latter is a word that perfectly captures a kind of nostalgia for a lost past.</p></div></div>`;
