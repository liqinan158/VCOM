Your boss fired you and your dog run away from home? Then you're probably feeling a state of <i>emptiness,</i> a condition of meaninglessness or futility. Cheer up, you could try writing a country music song.</p><p class="long">Although the emotional sense of <i>emptiness</i> is the most common, it can also mean a literal state of physical emptiness -— as in "the <i>emptiness</i> of space." Either way, emptiness might seem like a pretty bad thing, but consider the Bhuddist understanding of the term, for whom emptiness is in fact the ultimate virtue: “<i>Emptiness</i> which is conceptually liable to be mistaken for sheer nothingness is in fact the reservoir of infinite possibilities,” said the famous Japanese teacher, D. T. Suzuki.</p></div></div>`;
