Anything very holy is full of divinity. Divinity is also the subject of religion itself: divinity students are studying theology. But if you're not into religion, don't worry â€” you can still enjoy divinity, a type of white, creamy fudge made with egg whites that probably goes well with angel food cake.</p></div></div>`;
