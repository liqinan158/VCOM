When a person is described with the adjective <i>stainless</i>, it means that they are exemplary, or extremely good.</p><p class="long">If you have any silver-colored appliances in your kitchen, they're probably stainless steel, specially formulated so they won't discolor or corrode. Most everyday spoons and forks are stainless steel as well. If someone refers to your sister's stainless reputation, on the other hand, he is implying that everyone thinks of her as well-behaved, almost saintly. This kind of <i>stainless</i> has been used since the 16th century; stainless steel wasn't invented until 1917.</p></div></div>`;
