It comes from the Latin word for "seize," and originally meant an unexpected military attack.  When the novelist Charles Lever wrote in 1841 of "three cavalry regiments, their noiseless gestures and perfect stillness bespeaking at once that they were intended for a surprise party," he meant a surprise attack, not a birthday party.</p></div>`;
