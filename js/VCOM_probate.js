A will may require <i>probate</i> because the person that signed it isn’t around to verify his or her signature.</p><p class="long">As Ambrose Bierce wrote, “Death is not the end. There remains the litigation over the estate.” So comes the need for the probate. Though <i>probate</i>, from the Latin <i>probare</i>, “to test or prove,” is usually used for wills, it can also be applied to other legal documents, as in the proving of the validity of a document, or an official certification proving the document is real. <i>Probate</i> is also a verb meaning “to place a convicted person on probation.”</p></div>`;
