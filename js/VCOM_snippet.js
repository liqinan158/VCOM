You might only have time to read a <i>snippet</i> of "Moby Dick" before your early English class â€” just enough to know it's a book about a whale.</p><p class="long">While a <i>snippet</i> can be a literal fragment of something, like a snippet of hair clipped off the end of your dog's tail, the word is often used to talk about less physical bits. You may get a snippet of information by watching TV news with the sound turned off, or end your writing workshop with just a snippet of an idea for your screenplay. It comes from <i>snip</i>, with its Low German root <i>snippen</i>, "to snip or shred."</p></div>`;
