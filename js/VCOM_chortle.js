If you have a toddler, you will recognize the sound of a delighted <i>chortle</i>, sort of louder and a bit more raucous than a giggle.</p><p class="long">In 1871, Lewis Carroll, who wrote "Alice in Wonderland," coined the word <i>chortle</i> in the poem "Jabberwocky," about a son who slays a monster and comes back to his relieved and happy father: "'O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!' He chortled in his joy." Experts consider the word a blend of the words <i>chuckle</i> and <i>snort</i> and the laugh itself is also a cross between the two. You may chortle in glee if you find out your work nemesis just got a new job in another office â€” out of state.</p></div>`;
