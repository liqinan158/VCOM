In a figurative sense, a <i>goal</i> is the mission of a person or group. A tangible <i>goal</i> could be the net at one end of a soccer field. Your <i>goal</i> is to kick the ball into the net, and then you will have scored a <i>goal</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Goal</i> used to mean "the end point of a race." When you score a <i>goal</i> during a sporting event, the play does momentarily stop. If your <i>goal</i> is to win the presidency and you are in fact elected, you have achieved that <i>goal</i>. A <i>goal</i> is the reason for your efforts. People set <i>goals</i> in all aspects of their lives, not just in scoring points. "Her <i>goal</i> is to eat 40 cupcakes in one day." Go figure.</p></div>`;
