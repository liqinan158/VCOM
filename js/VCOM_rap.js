That’s some old school Brooklyn <i>rap</i>, but you can <i>rap</i> to any beat you want. Hit it!</p><p class="long">A rap is a knock or blow, like if you rap somebody upside the head as a gentle reminder to pay attention. The word <i>rap</i> also means, "reputation,” like if you get a bad rap at school for sleeping in class. It’s also "to talk at great length." And there’s the musical rap, the “genre that includes talking rhythmically over a beat.” This meaning comes from African American slang for, basically, "talking.”</p></div></div>`;
