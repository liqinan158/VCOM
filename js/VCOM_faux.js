Now if we have the words <i>fake</i>, <i>imitation</i>, and <i>false</i> (all of which are good synonyms), why use <i>faux</i>? For fashion, dahling. Use <i>faux</i> to talk about faux fur, faux gemstones, or to make fun of a "faux pas," which is French for "no-no," widely used among the witty international set when someone does something <i>gauche</i> (French for "clumsy").</p></div></div>`;
