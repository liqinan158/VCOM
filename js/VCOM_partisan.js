You'll often hear of the <i>partisan</i> politics in the U.S.— since politicians seem to be completely devoted to the agendas of their own parties.</p><p class="long"><i>Partisan</i> can be used to describe rabid supporters of any person or activity. In American English, however, it is most often used to refer to politics and the American two-party system of Democrats and Republicans. A bill introduced may have partisan support from the party that introduced the bill, or — more rarely it seems to American voters — the bill may even have bipartisan support. The prefix <i>bi</i> is added to show the support from both parties.</p></div></div>`;
