var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">effete</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Effete</i> is a disapproving term meaning decadent and self-indulgent, even useless. The stereotype of the rugged Westerner is just as false as the one of the <i>effete</i> East Coast liberal.</p><p class="long">The origin of the word <i>effete</i> is a little unexpected. Coming from the Latin <i>effetus</i> "out of, past childbearing," <i>effete</i> meant "exhausted, spent" long before it acquired the sense of morally exhausted and overly refined. This is the main use of the word today. Do you ever wonder why some effete party girls are considered celebrities? Star athletes run the risk of losing their edge and becoming effete posterboys for their sports.</p></div>`;
