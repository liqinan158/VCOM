You might feel much wiser and more sophisticated than your <i>young</i> cousins â€” even if you secretly enjoy playing games with them.</p><p class="long">As a noun, <i>young</i> generally means "animal babies," like when a mother duck and her young cross the street, though it can also refer collectively to young people: "The young recover so quickly from being sick." When you describe someone as <i>young</i>, you typically mean that they're immature, youthful, or simply not as old as you might expect: "Kids are getting phones so young these days!"</p></div>`;
