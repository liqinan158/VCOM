You might be tempted to call your babysitting charge a <i>jackanapes</i> after he locks you out of the house for the third time.</p><p class="long"><i>Jackanapes</i> is a colorful but very old fashioned way to describe a rascal or a whippersnapper. Your great-grandfather might shake his cane and yell, "Get off my lawn, you <i>jackanapes</i>!" when the neighbor kids lose their basketball in his yard, but they're unlikely to know what the word means. <i>Jackanapes</i> is from the fifteenth century, and it's thought to come from the phrase "Jack of Naples," or to have some connection to the word <i>apes</i>, but experts are uncertain.</p></div></div>`;
