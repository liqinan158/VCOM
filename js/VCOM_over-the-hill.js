var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">over-the-hill</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the adjective <i>over-the-hill</i> when you need a blunt way to describe someone as really old. You might feel <i>over-the-hill</i> if you can't keep up with the little boy you're babysitting.</p><p class="long">When someone is over-the-hill, he's too old to be of much use, like a former football player who's past his prime. It's more common for a person to describe himself as over-the-hill than to talk about someone else this way: "I just turned sixty â€” I'm officially <i>over-the-hill</i>." It's also commonly used in a joking way. This phrase has been around since about 1950.</p></div></div>`;
