You have to go shopping on Saturday to buy new tube socks, and <i>moreover</i>, you need to get a birthday present for your mom.</p><p class="long">Breaking moreover into <i>more</i> and <i>over</i> helps you remember what it means: more information over what has already been said. When you hear someone use <i>moreover</i> that tips you off that whatever follows is going to relate to what came before. You can think of <i>moreover</i> as a formal way of saying <i>besides</i>. You may be sick of your brother always getting out of doing the chores, and, moreover, the guy has a really bad attitude about taking on responsibility.</p></div>`;
