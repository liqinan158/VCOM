In fact, <i>granular</i> comes from the Latin word <i>granum</i> for "grain." Granular things can also be described as coarse and gritty. A smooth, shiny floor is the opposite of granular. When you see the word <i>granular</i>, think “grain of sand.” Or — “grain of sugar” if that’s more your style.</p></div>`;
