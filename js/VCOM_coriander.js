Both the leaves and seeds of <i>coriander</i> show up in Indian, Mexican, and Thai recipes, among others.</p><p class="long">The bright green leaves of coriander are also called "cilantro" in North America, and they're an ingredient in many regional dishes, often appearing as a garnish on both curries and guacamole. Coriander seeds are ground into a spice with a lemony, slightly spicy flavor that's found in many Indian dishes. <i>Coriander</i> has a Greek root, <i>koriannon</i>, which some botanists suspect is related to <i>koris</i>, "bedbug," because of the unripe plant's unpleasant smell.</p></div>`;
