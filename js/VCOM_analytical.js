(No, this is not the start of a joke.) They were both <i>analytical</i> — meaning they were good at breaking down problems into smaller parts to find solutions.</p><p class="long">The adjective, <i>analytical,</i> and the related verb <i>analyze</i> can both be traced back to the Greek verb, <i>analyein</i> — "to break up, to loosen." If you are analytical, you are good at taking a problem or task and breaking it down into smaller elements in order to solve the problem or complete the task. The opposite type of problem-solving is called the intuitive approach in which a person senses the correct action to take without proof or reasoning. <i>Analytic</i> can be substituted for <i>analytical</i> in this sense.</p></div>`;
