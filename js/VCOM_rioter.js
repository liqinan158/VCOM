If you want a peaceful protest rally, don't invite <i>rioters</i>.</p><p class="long">Sometimes protesters are accused of being rioters: the difference between the two is that protesters are generally peaceful, and that even if they're stirred to violent action, protesters have a social or political goal â€” or an event or policy to protest. Rioters only have the goal of causing a disruption. Sports fans sometimes turn into rioters after a big loss (or win). <i>Rioter</i> comes from the Old French, in which it means "chatter, dispute, or quarrel."</p></div>`;
