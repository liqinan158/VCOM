If he were coming in from the snow, you could blame static and hat-hair for his <i>disheveled</i> look, but no, he just never uses a comb.</p><p class="long">People or things that are disheveled are kind of a mess. Wrinkled clothes, knotted hair, and a chaotic house might earn the adjective <i>disheveled.</i> There are a lot of synonyms for <i>disheveled,</i> including "disordered," "sloppy," and "cluttered." A person can look disheveled when getting up in the morning, and some people even adopt a disheveled look on purpose, trying to appear casual about grooming and dressing while working hard to achieve just the right unwashed and mussed-up style.</p></div></div>`;
