If you can't help laughing <i>convulsively</i> during a friend's awkward speech, you'll be shaking with laughter.</p><p class="long">Movements that are connected to actual convulsions — the involuntary, abnormal movement of the body's muscles — happen convulsively. Other things occur convulsively too, like hiccups and laughter and crying: "She sobbed <i>convulsively</i> when her dog ran away." The adverb <i>convulsively</i> comes from the verb <i>convulse</i>, which is rooted in the Latin <i>convulsus</i>, "pulled away" or "wrenched."</p></div></div>`;
