Remember, when you <i>tether</i> that chair to those balloons, use a strong <i>tether</i>. You don't want to drop from the sky because you tied them together using a cheap piece of rope.</p><p class="long">Think of the childhood game <i>tether</i>-ball. The ball is tethered to a pole by a tether. <i>Tether</i> usually refers to a rope or a chain, but it can also refer to an invisible bond or link. For example, the Internet can serve as a tether that links you to your pen pal in Germany. The love between a mother and her child keeps them tethered to each other for a lifetime. And whenever astronauts go for jaunts outside the space station, they tether themselves to the station using wires and a hook.</p></div></div>`;
