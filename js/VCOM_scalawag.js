A <i>scalawag</i> would take the cookies right off your plate!</p><p class="long">This funny, old-fashioned word refers to people who are deceitful and untrustworthy. Scalawags are up to no good. Someone who steals your wallet or lies to your face is a scalawag. Scalawags play tricks and break laws, but they don’t do serious crimes — a murderer is much worse than a scalawag. A scalawag can also be someone who is only mischievous and playful, like that kid who took your cookies.</p></div></div>`;
