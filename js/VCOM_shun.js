A sensitive baker may ask why you are <i>shunning</i> her cookies.</p><p class="long">Although the verb <i>shun</i> means to deliberately avoid anything, it has a specific meaning in certain groups and communities. In this case, it means to ostracize or expel from that group or community. The Amish, for example, may <i>shun</i> members of their order who repeatedly ignore the beliefs and rules of Amish society. The word may also be used in more casual group settings. After many attempts at being polite, you and your friends began to <i>shun</i> the obnoxious woman who never let you get a word in edgewise.</p></div></div>`;
