If you really want to cut down on the clutter in your apartment, you can't be sentimental about keepsakes. You have to be <i>ruthless</i> and throw out everything that's not absolutely essential.</p><p class="long">If you're <i>ruthless</i>, you're the polar opposite of Mother Theresa. You get called heartless and cold-blooded. That's one of the reasons the word crops up so often to describe dictators and tyrants, though it can also apply to other personality types â€” like corporate raiders and colleagues so success-driven that they'll gladly steamroll anyone to get ahead. It finds its way into milder contexts, too: Just be ruthless and rip off the Band-Aid already!</p></div></div>`;
