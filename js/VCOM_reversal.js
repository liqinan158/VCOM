You liked history, but thought you'd major in business because there were more jobs. Then you took an economics class and hated it. So in a <i>reversal</i>, you majored in history after all.</p><p class="long">In legal terms, a <i>reversal</i> is when a high court decides the decision of a lower court is incorrect and should be overturned. In a reversal, the Supreme Court overturned the guilty verdict of the lower court, and the prisoner was set free. A setback or a change in circumstances for the worse is also a <i>reversal</i>. If you make poor investments, you may suffer a reversal in fortune and go from shopping for designer clothes to shopping at thrift stores.</p></div>`;
