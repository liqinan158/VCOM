A paraprofessional, for example, helps other professionals, like teachers, but isn’t actually a teacher. Paralegals are not lawyers, but they assist lawyers by doing research, filing paperwork, gathering materials, and providing whatever else lawyers need to do their jobs. Without paralegals, the job of a lawyer would be a lot tougher.</p></div>`;
