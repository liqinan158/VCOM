You might use extra class time after you've finished a test to make a quick <i>drawing</i> of your teacher sleeping at his desk.</p><p class="long">A drawing is an artwork that's not a painting â€” it's made of sketched lines and represents some object, person, or form. An architect might begin working on a project for a house design by doing some drawings, and a kindergartener might proudly hang a drawing of her family on the refrigerator. Another kind of <i>drawing</i> is the act of pulling, which is also the earliest meaning of the word.</p></div></div>`;
