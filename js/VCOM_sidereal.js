I mean really far out â€” as in related to the distant stars of the universe.

Anything that's sidereal has something to do with stars and constellations. And if you measure the days and weeks by the movement of the stars across the sky, that's called sidereal astronomy or sidereal time. But if you've got someplace to be, you'd be better off with a good calendar and a wristwatch.</p></div></div>`;
