A chess set with a lost piece is incomplete. <i>Incomplete</i> also means “unfinished,” like that incomplete bridge to nowhere.

You might get an <i>incomplete</i> grade for a class if your teacher is going to let you make up work you missed. When something's incomplete, part of that thing is missing or undone</p></div>`;
