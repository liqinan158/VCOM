After the noise of the city, it's peaceful to go camping in the woods where everything is <i>still</i>.</p><p class="long">Things that are tranquil are still, like the calm surface of a lake or a sleeping baby. If you stand still, you freeze in place. Another meaning of <i>still</i> is an individual shot from a movie, an unmoving snapshot of a single scene. When <i>still</i> is an adverb, it means even now, like when you say you still love an old song or you still remember the kindness of your kindergarten teacher.</p></div></div>`;
