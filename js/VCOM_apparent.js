var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">apparent</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Apparent</i> means obvious, but — and this is confusing — it can also mean something that seems to be true but isn't definite. "The train's arrival is <i>apparent</i> — it's in the station — but <i>apparently</i> my friend missed it because she is not getting off."</p><p class="long">It makes sense that <i>apparent</i> has the same ancient root as <i>appear</i> because it's about what is plain to see. Its subtle power of suggestion, however, is wonderfully useful. The "heir <i>apparent</i>" technically means next in line, but the ink isn't dry. The power of <i>apparent</i> is that it leaves the door open for a little ambiguity. Maybe the heir apparent will be the next king, or maybe he'll be overthrown in a bloodless coup by his apparently more ambitious cousin.</p></div></div>`;
