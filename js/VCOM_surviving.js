For example, if a person dies, the husband or wife is "the <i>surviving</i> spouse."</p><p class="long">The Greek philosopher Epicurus said, "You don't develop courage by being happy in your relationships every day. You develop it by <i>surviving</i> difficult times and challenging adversity." The word <i>surviving</i> is the adjectival form of the verb <i>survive</i>, which comes from the Latin <i>vivere</i>, "to live," plus the prefix <i>super-</i>, "over, beyond." The surviving person is the one who manages to go on living after another's death. The word has a legal importance, in that a surviving person may be an heir.</p></div>`;
