It was formed from <i>casuist</i> (along the lines of <i>sophistry</i> and <i>foolery</i>), which can mean one who engages in such reasoning, though it originally meant someone who resolves doubtful cases by the application of principles. Casuistry is used to bamboozle people, so steer clear of those who practice it!</p></div>`;
