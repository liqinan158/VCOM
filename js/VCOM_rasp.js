Your <i>rasp</i>-y voice might get you a gig as a lounge singer, but probably not as a preschool teacher.</p><p class="long">The tool called a <i>rasp</i> is a special kind of wood file that's much coarser than sandpaper, and when you use it, you rasp. If you've ever cared for a horse's hooves, you may have also used a rasp to file them. The "speak gratingly" meaning of <i>rasp</i> comes from the "scraping" sense of the word. If your voice sounds like a rasp against a rough surface, you're rasping.</p></div></div>`;
