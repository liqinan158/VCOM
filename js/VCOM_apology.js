An <i>apology</i> is nice, but chocolates or large bundles of cash are nicer.  Always.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>apology</i> has its roots in the Greek <i>apologos</i>, meaning a story. It entered the English language in the Middle Ages.  If you broke your friend’s sword and then made up an elaborate story to get out of trouble, that was an <i>apology</i>.  After a few decades, the general sense of the word shifted to its current meaning — what you say when you want to express real remorse.</p></div></div>`;
