It's a great pleasure to <i>loll</i> about in the park instead of going to work. But your boss might have a problem with it.</p><p class="long"><i>Loll</i> means to droop, or hang loosely. We usually use it to describe the behavior of hanging loosely, like <i>lolling</i> about on the beach reading a book. Sometimes it’s the perfect word for a drooping object. If you take your dog for a long run in the hot sun, its tongue will loll out of its mouth. If you fall asleep on the bus ride home, your head might loll onto your neighbor’s shoulder.</p></div></div>`;
