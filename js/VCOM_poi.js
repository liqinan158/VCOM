If you’re having a Hawaiian luau, get some flower leis, a ukulele player, and a big bowl of <i>poi</i>. Not sure about the <i>poi</i>? Don’t worry, it’s gluten free!</p><p class="long">Some poi is thick and dough-like, while other servings of this staple food are almost a liquid. Native Hawaiians describe poi in terms of fingers, calling it "one-finger," "two-finger," and so on, depending on how many fingers you need to scoop it up. <i>Poi</i> was once the name of a now-extinct Hawaiian dog breed that was fed poi and fattened to be eaten. Today, many Hawaiians use "<i>poi</i> dog" to mean a mixed-breed dog.</p></div></div>`;
