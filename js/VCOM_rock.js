Instead, move the baby gently from side to side.  If this doesn't calm the child, play some loud <i>rock</i> music.</p><p class="long">When rocking a baby you move gently, but when you're told not to “<i>rock</i> the boat” the rocking movement referred to is more violent, enough to tip the boat over.  This kind of motion has more in common with what you do when “<i>rocking</i> out” listening to music.  A rock is also a lump of mineral, and if we say someone is "like a <i>rock</i>," we mean he's totally dependable.</p></div></div>`;
