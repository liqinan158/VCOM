You'll often hear people griping about <i>exorbitant</i> bank fees or <i>exorbitant</i> interest rates.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>exorbitant</i> was originally a legal term to describe a case that was outside the bounds of the law. It comes from the Latin roots â€” the prefix <i>ex</i>, meaning "out of," and <i>orbita</i>, meaning "wheel track." You can see how the word now has come to be described as something that has gone way off the beaten track, especially in terms of price and value.</p></div></div>`;
