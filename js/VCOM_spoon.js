The curviest utensil in the drawer, a <i>spoon</i> is good for scooping soup, ice cream, or anything else that might fall through the slats on a fork.</p><p class="long">The small bowl-like end of a spoon is ideal for scooping and holding small amounts of soft or liquid foods. You couldn't eat your soup with a fork, and it would be challenging to get pudding into your mouth without a spoon. You can use <i>spoon</i> as a verb, too: "I watched her <i>spoon</i> cereal into her mouth while she watched cartoons." It also means "to lie together cuddled like two <i>spoons</i>."</p></div></div>`;
