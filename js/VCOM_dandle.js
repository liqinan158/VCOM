Your eccentric aunt Iris might dandle her big Maine Coon cat on her lap, or her little toy poodle, but you're most likely to find the verb <i>dandle</i> alongside the word <i>baby</i>. The origin of this sixteenth century word is uncertain, though it may be related to the imitative Old French <i>dandin</i>, "small bell."</p></div>`;
