This word is popular in the chemistry lab, but you might also hear it at a garage. For example, a corrosion <i>inhibitor</i> helps slow down rust.</p><p class="long">When you feel inhibited, you feel self-conscious and less likely to do things. In chemistry, an inhibitor has the effect of squelching something, shutting it down, or slowing it. For example, in a car engine, antifreeze is an inhibitor â€” it prevents or slows the formation of ice. Different substances are inhibitors for different reactions and activities. Think of an inhibitor as chemistry's way of saying "Slow down!" or "Stop!"</p></div></div>`;
