Your pet parrot might <i>squawk</i> until you give her treats to nibble on.</p><p class="long">The imitative word <i>squawk</i> first appeared in the 1800s, and around 1945, the term <i>squawk box</i> began to be used informally to mean "intercom or loudspeaker." Today, that term is primarily used by investors and brokers to mean "an intercom used to communicate stock deals." In addition to being the sound of an irritated bird, a <i>squawk</i> is also a complaint: "All he does is <i>squawk</i> about how hard his new job is."</p></div></div>`;
