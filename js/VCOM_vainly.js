When you're <i>vainly</i> trying to fall asleep, the night can seem to last far longer than eight hours.</p><p class="long">If you fall vainly in love with someone, it's hopeless â€” it's never going to work out between the two of you. And if you try vainly to convince your friends not to gossip about a classmate, they just won't listen to you despite your efforts. You can also use this adverb to mean "in a conceited way," like when the evil queen in Sleeping Beauty stares vainly into her magic mirror asking, "Who's the fairest one of all?"</p></div></div>`;
