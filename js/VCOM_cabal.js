Some conspiracy theories are based on the idea that governments worldwide are in the hands of a powerful <i>cabal</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Cabal</i> comes from the word <i>cabbala</i> (also spelled <i>kabbala</i>), which refers to a Jewish tradition of interpreting texts. Cabbala is often regarded as a secret and mystical practice and, as such, the word took on the additional meaning of “secret behavior.” <i>Cabal</i> comes from this sense of the word. A well-known cabal in 17th-century England was coincidentally made up of five members whose names’ initial letters spelled the word cabal. (Their names were Clifford, Arlington, Buckingham, Ashley, and Lauderdale.)</p></div>`;
