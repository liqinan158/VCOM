You could say that your <i>makeup</i> is a combination of your parents' genes.

This kind of makeup is also called <i>cosmetics</i>, and it consists of things like lipstick, mascara, foundation, and so on. This meaning of <i>makeup</i> has been in use since the 1880s, a period when Queen Victoria declared it vulgar, only appropriate for stage actors.</p></div></div>`;
