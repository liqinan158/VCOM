If the captain of a ship is using <i>autopilot</i>, she can take a break from manning the controls herself.</p><p class="long">When a plane is on autopilot, it's not exactly flying itself, but it's set to maintain a course or altitude while the pilot concentrates on other details of operating the airplane. <i>Autopilot</i> is short for <i>automatic pilot</i>, and the first such system for aircraft was invented in 1912. The nickname came later, in the 1930s. The slang meaning of <i>autopilot</i> is "out of habit," as when a sleep deprived worker goes through his whole day on autopilot.</p></div></div>`;
