var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">patently</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the adverb <i>patently</i> when you want to emphasize something as clearly obvious. For example, you might say "It's <i>patently</i> clear that you hate spinach."</p><p class="long">It might be patently obvious to you that your roommate forgot to take out the trash, or patently absurd that your brother thinks he will have a long, successful career as a street magician and fire juggler. Either way, the word <i>patently</i> serves to emphasize how apparent or clear your observation is. The Latin root of <i>patently</i> makes its meaning patently clear: <i>patere</i> means "lie open" or "be open."</p></div>`;
