The next time someone accuses you of dragging your feet and asks you to speed it up, calmly tell them that you’re perfecting your <i>saunter</i>.</p><p class="long">A verb of unconfirmed origin, <i>saunter</i> means to “walk with a leisurely gait.” As a noun, <i>saunter</i> describes that leisurely gait.
