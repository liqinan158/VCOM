The percussionist in an orchestra has the enviable job of making two cymbals <i>clash</i> together.</p><p class="long">Kids clash when they run into each other on the playground, but they can also clash through a strong disagreement: "My cousins always <i>clash</i> when it comes to deciding what movie to watch after dinner." Also, your shirt might clash with your pants, if the colors or prints simply don't go together. <i>Clash</i> is imitative â€” it sounds like its original meaning, "make a loud, sharp sound," and may be related to the words <i>clap</i> and <i>crash</i>.</p></div></div>`;
