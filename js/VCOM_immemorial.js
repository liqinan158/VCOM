You're most likely to hear this word in the phrase "time <i>immemorial</i>," a common way to say "so long ago that no one remembers it."</p><p class="long">The French <i>imm√©morial</i> means "old beyond memory," from a Latin root. Don't confuse this adjective with <i>immemorable</i>, which is sometimes used instead, but which literally means "not worth remembering." <i>Immemorial</i> is a perfect way to describe ancient things, including stories, customs, religions, and even time itself.</p></div></div>`;
