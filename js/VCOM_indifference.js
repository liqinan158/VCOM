When you feel <i>indifference</i> for something, you neither like it nor dislike it.</p><p class="long">If you are a person who feels a lot of indifference, you probably say "eh," a lot. You just don't care much. <i>Indifference</i> can be compared to <i>apathy,</i> which means "lack of concern," though <i>apathy</i> is a little stronger: Apathy means you don't care whether your friends call you; indifference means you don't care what movie you end up seeing â€” you don't have a strong preference for any of the choices.</p></div></div>`;
