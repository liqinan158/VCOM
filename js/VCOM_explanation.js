Because <i>explanation</i> and <i>explain</i> are so closely related, people often try to shoehorn an extra <i>i</i> into the spelling of <i>explanation</i>. Don't. You might think that <i>explanation</i> has the odd spelling, but it is really the more regular of the two because there is no <i>i</i> in <i>explanare</i>.</p></div></div>`;
