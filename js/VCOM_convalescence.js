The actual period of convalescence is from when you first  get sick until your complete recovery.  Convalescence for an illness is often accompanied by various medicines, the most effective of which often include TLC and hot chicken soup. Playwright George Bernard Shaw once quipped, "I enjoy convalescence. It is the part that makes the illness worth while."</p></div>`;
