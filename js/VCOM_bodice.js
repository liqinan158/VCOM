Wedding dresses often have a fitted <i>bodice</i> and a long, flowing skirt.</p><p class="long">While a bodice is one part of a dress, along with sleeves and a skirt, it can also describe an old-fashioned, vest-like article of clothing. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the bodice was often separate but sewn from the same material as a skirt. You can still see this type of bodice in various types of European folk clothing, like a German dirndl. In the 1560s, <i>bodice</i> was the plural form of <i>body</i>, a "tight-fitting Elizabethan garment."</p></div>`;
