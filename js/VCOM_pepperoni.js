On pizza night, you and your sister might argue about toppings: you prefer <i>pepperoni</i>, while she likes mushrooms and olives.</p><p class="long">Officially, pepperoni is a variety of salami, a sausage that makes most people think of sandwiches rather than pizza. Usually pepperoni is bright red, with a peppery, smoky flavor and a soft, chewy texture. Rather than black pepper, most pepperoni is flavored with paprika, a seasoning made from sweet bell peppers. The origin of the name backs this up: it comes from the Italian <i>peperone</i>, "bell pepper."</p></div></div>`;
