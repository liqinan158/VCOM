There are many good reasons to expand your vocabulary, so you could say the benefits of learning new words are <i>manifold</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Manifold</i> sounds like "many fold," which is what it is â€” something with many features, like a wallet with lots of folds so stuffed with junk that makes you sit funny when it's in your back pocket. As an adjective, <i>manifold</i> loves to appear in books, like Mrs. Gryce in Edith Wharton's "The House of Mirth," whose "domestic duties were manifold." As a noun, a <i>manifold</i> is a pipe branching into many openings, often found in car engines.</p></div>`;
