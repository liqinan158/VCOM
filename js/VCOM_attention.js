var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">attention</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">"May I have your <i>attention</i> please?" When you ask that question, you are asking people to focus their mental powers on you. Whether they do or not depends on your next words. You'll have their full <i>attention</i> if you say, "Here's $100."</p><p class="long">The noun <i>attention</i> can also refer to an interest in something or someone. You probably pay attention in school when your teachers bring up topics in which you are personally interested. You can also shower attention on those you love or indulge. The word also refers to "standing at <i>attention</i>," as in the military â€” by standing up straight, arms down at the sides, and feet together.</p></div></div>`;
