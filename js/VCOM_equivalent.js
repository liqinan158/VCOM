Now it can be used to describe things that have the same effect, or importance, or role â€” for example, "England's Parliament is the  <i>equivalent</i> of America's Congress." It can also be used as an adjective: "Eating a bowl of Sugar Pops for breakfast is <i>equivalent</i> to starting your day with two scoops of ice-cream."</p></div>`;
