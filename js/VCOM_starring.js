The Greek word <i>aster</i> became the English word <i>star</i>, which was first used to mean "to be featured in a play" in the 1820s. If you imagine a star shining brightly in the dark night sky, it's easy to see how <i>starring</i> came to mean "being the most important on the stage."</p></div></div>`;
