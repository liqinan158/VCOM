If it's <i>terrestrial</i>, you'll find it on earth. If it's extra<i>terrestrial</i>, you'll find it emerging from a UFO.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>terrestrial</i> can also be used to describe something that lives on land (as opposed to living in water, for example). "On their trip to the rain forest, the scientists were charged with cataloging <i>terrestrial</i> animals. Another group was going to be in charge of cataloging the aquatic animals." The adjective can also be used to describe something that is mundane in character. The teenager cried, "My life is boring and full of <i>terrestrial</i> events like going to band practice and to class!"</p></div>`;
