An asymptote is a straight line, but specifically one that approaches or nears a curve but never meets it. The noun <i>asymptote</i> has been a geometry term since the 1600's, and it comes from the Greek root <i>asymptotos</i>, or "not falling together,"  which combines <i>a</i>, "not," <i>syn</i>, "with," and <i>ptotos</i>, "fallen."</p></div>`;
