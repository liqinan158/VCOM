When you arrive at an inn, the <i>innkeeper</i> might be the person who checks you in and gives you a key to your room (and maybe a chocolate on your pillow).</p><p class="long">The earliest innkeepers ran inns in Europe during medieval times. These inns provided lodging, food, and a place for travelers to leave their horses, and an innkeeper managed all of these details. Today in the UK, some pubs call themselves <i>inns</i>, so you might find an innkeeper serving pints there, while in the US an inn is almost always a more charming version of a motel, run by an innkeeper.</p></div></div>`;
