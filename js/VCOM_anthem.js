The original word meant a song sung antiphonally, or in turns by two groups of singers. Today, <i>anthem</i> has little to do with the way the vocals are arranged and more to do with the content of the message. When a group of people sing an anthem, whether it’s the national anthem, or the anthem of your third-grader’s beetle-collecting club, they express their devotion to a cause they identify with.</p></div>`;
