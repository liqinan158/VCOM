The composer's greatest <i>opus</i> was inspired by the blooming of the spring flowers.</p><p class="long">While an opus is a piece of work, usually musical, the best way to remember it is to know that the preferred plural of <i>opus</i> is <i>opera</i> which everyone associates with music. You can also say <i>opuses</i> for the plural if you want, but how is that going to help you remember anything? A common usage of <i>opus</i> is with the term magnum opus which refers to oneâ€™s greatest work, musical or otherwise.</p></div></div>`;
