Bob Marley, who died in 1981, is still the most well-known <i>reggae</i> musician.</p><p class="long">The origins of the word <i>reggae</i> are a bit unclear, although most experts think it comes from the Jamaican English <i>rege-rege</i>, which means both "a quarrel or protest" and "ragged clothing." It first appeared in the title of a Toots and the Maytals song, "Do the Reggay," in 1968. Reggae grew out of ska and rocksteady, slowing the rhythm and adding a distinctive upbeat. Reggae is closely connected with the Rastafarian religion.</p></div>`;
