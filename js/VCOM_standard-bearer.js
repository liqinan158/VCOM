If a news story says that a new member of Congress is a standard-bearer for young conservatives, that means she speaks for many politicians who share those beliefs and is seen as a leader among them. This meaning comes from the original definition, "a soldier carrying (or <i>bearing</i>) the flag of a specific military unit or state."</p></div></div>`;
