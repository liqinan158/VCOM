Did you see the outfielders run into each other and the shortstop slip and fall in the mud? Don't laugh — we all have our <i>contretemps</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>contretemps</i>, pronounced "CON-tre-tahn," is French — <i>contre</i> means "against" and <i>temps</i> means "time." A mishap, perhaps caused by bad timing, is one kind of contretemps. Another is an argument or conflict, especially an awkward one. A contretemps can result from a misunderstanding or miscommunication. It's also a term for a blunder in both ballet and fencing.</p></div>`;
