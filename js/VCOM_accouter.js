A boy who runs away to join the army might first <i>accouter</i> himself in a camouflage jacket and steel-toed boots.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>accouter</i> most commonly describes a soldier being outfitted for battle or a person dressing in some impressive uniform or outfit. You could, for example, say that your friends like to accouter themselves in feathers and sequins before they march in the Mardi Gras parade. The word can also be spelled <i>accoutre</i>, and both versions come from <i>acostrer</i>, "arrange, put on clothing, or sew up," from the Latin roots <i>ad</i>, "to," and <i>consutura</i>, "a sewing together."</p></div>`;
