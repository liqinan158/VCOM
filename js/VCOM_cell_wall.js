A major function of the <i>cell wall</i> is to give the cell strength and structure, and to filter molecules that pass in and out of the cell.</p><p class="long">A <i>cell</i> is the smallest part of an organism that still contains that organism's elements.  The word itself comes from the Latin <i>cella</i>, meaning "small room." Although the word is found prior to the 12th Century, its application to a <i>cell</i> didn't come about until 1845, and the idea of a plantâ€™s cell wall came about in 1848. Animal cells do not have such a cell wall, but instead have a membrane that serves as a boundary for the cell.</p></div></div>`;
