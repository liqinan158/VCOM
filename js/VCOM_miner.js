A <i>miner</i> is a person who makes a living digging coal, salt, gold, minerals, or other natural resources out of the earth.</p><p class="long">The root here is the noun <i>mine</i>—not the word that possessive toddlers like to shout, but the one that describes a man-made underground network of tunnels and quarries. Don’t confuse <i>miner</i> with <i>minor</i> (note the “o”). <i>Minor</i> refers to musical intervals, small or trivial things, and people under age 18.</p></div>`;
