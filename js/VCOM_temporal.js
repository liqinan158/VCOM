A less common word, <i>temporality</i> also means "having limited time," and it rhymes with mortality! (Don't remind us.) <i>Temporal</i> implies "of this earth," too â€” temporal boundaries keep us from being able to fly around the clouds, but spiritual beings can zing around at will. <i>Temporal</i> can also refer to temples, the ones on the side of your head that are probably aching by now.</p></div></div>`;
