This could be positive (like a <i>dispersal</i> of money) or negative (like a <i>dispersal</i> of a crowd because of a bomb).</p><p class="long">If you know that dispersing is when something spreads out or separates, then you have a headstart to understanding <i>dispersal</i>. Dispersal causes something to be diffused or disseminated, like the dispersal of seeds in a garden.  A strong wind could cause the dispersal of someoneâ€™s homework. A tear gas bomb causes the dispersal of tear gas, which in turn will cause the dispersal of a crowd. Anytime something is spreading out or becoming widespread, there's a dispersal at play.</p></div></div>`;
