The philosophy that your mind and body are two completely separate, independent aspects of you is one particular type of <i>dualism</i>.</p><p class="long">There are many theories that go by the name of <i>dualism</i>, but the idea that minds and bodies are separate is probably the most common. Another type of dualism splits the world into a person and the world outside that person, with a barrier between the two. In fact, any time you divide things into two categories — hot and cold, good and evil, male and female — that's also a kind of dualism. The Latin root is <i>duo</i>, "two."</p></div></div>`;
