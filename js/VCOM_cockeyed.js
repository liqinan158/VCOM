Something that doesn't make sense or isn't believable can also be called <i>cockeyed</i>: "Then he told this <i>cockeyed</i> story about having lunch with the President." In the 1920s and 30s, the word also meant "drunk." It started out, in the 19th century, meaning "squint-eyed."</p></div></div>`;
