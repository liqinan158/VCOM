A <i>pig</i> is a farm animal with a curly tail, hooves, floppy ears, and a flat snout for rooting. Cooked <i>pig</i> is popular, but the <i>pig</i> from <i>Charlotte’s Web</i> is saved from becoming bacon by a crafty spider.</p><p class="long">Pigs are omnivores — they eat both plants and meat — and on small farms, they're fed kitchen leftovers as well as their basic diet. Their dining habits have given pigs the reputation of being greedy, and led to the informal use of <i>pig</i> to mean "greedy person," and <i>pig out</i> to mean "eat voraciously." Another colloquial meaning of <i>pig</i>, one that's been considered derogatory since it was coined in the nineteenth century, is "police officer."</p></div>`;
