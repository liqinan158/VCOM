It works in close conjunction with the knee, helping to extend the leg for moving and walking. This major muscle got the name <i>quadriceps</i> from <i>quadri-</i>, "consisting of four" in Latin, because of its division into four very distinct parts. <i>Quadriceps</i> is literally "four-headed."</p></div>`;
