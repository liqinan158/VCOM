You could also put on fins and a snorkel and check out some offshore coral reefs. Offshore breezes bring cooler air to the coast, and offshore drilling is a method of seeking out underwater oil and gas. If someone has an "<i>offshore</i> bank account," it means they keep their money in a foreign country — probably to avoid paying taxes on it.</p></div>`;
