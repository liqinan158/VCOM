First, it is used whenever you talk about dinosaurs to describe the various geologic time periods, for instance the Paleozoic <i>Era</i>, or the Jurassic <i>Era</i>. Second, it is a word beloved of crossword puzzle editors, so if you’re looking for a three-letter word for an age, look no further. Third, it sometimes confuses people who are talking about the ERA, or the Equal Rights Amendment, a vestige of the <i>era</i> of political feminism.</p></div>`;
