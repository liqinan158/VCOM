If you become CEO of a big company, you'll have to keep the interests of every <i>stakeholder</i> in mind, from the employees to the customers to the investors, whenever you make decisions.</p><p class="long">Supposedly people used to gamble by putting their money on a wooden stake, and a person called a <i>stakeholder</i> who wasn't involved in the betting would supervise to make sure everything was fair. No one uses wooden stakes anymore, but we still call the person who holds the money and monitors the betting the stakeholder, and people often use <i>stake</i> to mean "risk," or "investment." That's why someone who is invested in a business is also called a stakeholder.</p></div>`;
