It can be pretty awkward when you <i>mispronounce</i> someone's name, especially if you know the person well.</p><p class="long">Some words are easy to mispronounce, like <i>February</i>, <i>realtor</i>, and <i>meteorology</i>, simply because the sounds don't flow gracefully off the tongue. In other cases, non-native English speakers might mispronounce a word because it doesn't sound at all the way it looks â€” like <i>tongue</i>, for example. In any case, the verb <i>mispronounce</i> combines the prefix <i>mis-</i>, "wrong or bad," and <i>pronounce</i>, "to utter or say."</p></div>`;
