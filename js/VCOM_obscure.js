Be careful if you're driving in heavy rain â€” the painted lines can be <i>obscure</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Obscure</i> comes from Latin <i>obscurus</i>, which can mean "dark, dim," "unclear, hard to understand," or "insignificant, humble." We tend to use <i>obscure</i> in the metaphorical senses: an obscure sound is unclear, an obscure village is hidden away in the countryside, and an obscure poet is little known and probably insignificant. <i>Obscure</i> can also be used as a verb. If you get really nervous when you speak during a debate, your embarrassing twitches and shaking hands can obscure your argument.</p></div>`;
