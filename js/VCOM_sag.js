And older people are sometimes surprised to look in the mirror and see that their faces are beginning to sag with age. Objects sag too, with weight or age: "The porch on that old house has started to <i>sag</i> â€” the whole thing may need to be torn down." <i>Sag</i> is probably related to the Old Norse <i>sokkva</i>, "to sink."</p></div></div>`;
