A <i>bargain</i> is a good deal.</p><p class="long">Inexpensive items are one type of bargain, and another kind of bargain is an agreement you make with someone â€” a deal or compromise. Two countries might strike a trade bargain, or you could make a bargain with your friend that you'll drive to the mall if she buys you a giant cinnamon roll. <i>Bargain</i> also means to negotiate the details of a purchase, which makes sense because the root word is <i>bargaignier</i>, French for "haggle over the price."</p></div></div>`;
