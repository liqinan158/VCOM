Your boss may send around a <i>memo</i> in your office warning employees to not spend so much time socializing by the water cooler and to get back to work.</p><p class="long">The intent of most memos is to help you remember something, or to remind another person of something. In a business or government setting, it's particularly important to keep written notes on decisions and communications between people. A written or emailed memo is one way to keep such a record. The word is short for <i>memorandum</i>, "thing to be recorded" in Latin, and a close linguistic relative of <i>memory</i>.</p></div>`;
