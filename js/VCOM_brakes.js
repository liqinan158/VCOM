When you hit the <i>brakes</i>, you bring your car to a slower speed.</p><p class="long">Don't confuse <i>brakes</i> with <i>breaks</i>, which are periods of time in which activity stops, like coffee breaks or winter break. Both of these sound-alike words can also be verbs: you brake when your foot presses down on the pedal that makes a vehicle slow down. When you break for dinner, you stop working in order to eat, but if you break something, like a window, you cause damage â€” the thing you break no longer works.</p></div></div>`;
