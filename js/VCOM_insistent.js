If a salesperson is <i>insistent</i>, you may find it hard to walk away without buying something.</p><p class="long"><i>Insistent</i> shares a root with the verb <i>insist</i>: the Latin word <i>insistere</i>, which means "persist, dwell upon, stand upon." If you are insistent, you won't take "no" for an answer, dwelling on your ideas, standing up for your position. <i>Insistent</i> can also mean "demanding attention," like the insistent ringing of the telephone at a busy office or the insistent cries of a hungry baby.</p></div></div>`;
