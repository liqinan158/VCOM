The wave you give a good friend to call her over from across the room and the impulse that transmits your voice through the telephone to your mother are both <i>signals</i>.</p><p class="long">In the course of a single day, you probably send and receive thousands of different signals. When you want to cross the street, you wait for the green light — a signal that it's safe to cross. If you're in a relationship and you're not sure whether you like the person you're dating, you could be sending mixed signals — first acting like you're interested, and then acting uninterested. If your date finally gets tired of your mixed signals while you're at a restaurant, you'll need to signal to your server that it's time for the check.</p></div></div>`;
