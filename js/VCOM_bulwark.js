If you and your pals build a secret fort for girls only, you might want to build a <i>bulwark</i> to surround it â€” with a "No Boys Allowed" sign posted prominently.</p><p class="long">A seawall that runs perpendicular to the shore is sometimes called a bulwark, because it defends the beach, not against invaders, but against beach erosion. Although the noun <i>bulwark</i> can refer to any fortified wall, it often specifically refers to an earthen wall, like a rampart. As a verb, <i>bulwark</i> means to fortify with a wall or to provide protection: "The volunteers used sandbags to <i>bulwark</i> the levee in an attempt to prevent the flooded river from overflowing its banks."</p></div></div>`;
