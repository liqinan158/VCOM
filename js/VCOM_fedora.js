Many 1930s and 1940s actors wore <i>fedoras</i> in movies.</p><p class="long">Most fedoras are creased along the top, or crown, and pinched on either side, and they're sometimes trimmed around the center with a wide ribbon. Although fedoras might make you think of 1920s gangsters or Indiana Jones, the earliest fedoras were worn by women, and even became a symbol of the early women's rights movement. The word comes from an 1882 play, <i>FÃ©dora</i>, in which the actress Sarah Bernhardt wore a fedora.</p></div>`;
