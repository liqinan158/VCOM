You might <i>embrace</i> your sweetheart, or even changes in technology.</p><p class="long"><i>Embrace</i> is from the French verb <i>embrasser</i>, which started out meaning  "to clasp in the arms" (but now includes kissing). You <i>embrace</i> someone by giving her a giant hug, and when you <i>embrace</i> a new idea, it's like your brain gives it a hug. The noun and verb form are similar: If you <i>embrace</i> someone who isn't your sweetheart, you might get caught in an <i>embrace</i>. In <i>Henry IV</i>, Shakespeare writes about a really, really tight <i>embrace</i>: "I will <i>embrace</i> him with a soldier's arm/That he shall shrink under my courtesy."</p></div>`;
