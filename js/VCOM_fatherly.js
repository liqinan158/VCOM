You might be particularly fond of your older, <i>fatherly</i> next door neighbor.</p><p class="long">Fatherly people have several things in common: they're kind, supportive, often older than you are, and almost always male (the female equivalent is <i>motherly</i>). A favorite teacher might be fatherly, or an uncle. The Old English root of <i>fatherly</i> is <i>f√¶derlic</i>, with similar words formed the same way in Dutch and German.</p></div></div>`;
