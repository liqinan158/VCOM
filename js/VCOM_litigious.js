If a person is called <i>litigious</i> that means they tend to sue people, maybe excessively. If you think that there are too many lawsuits, you think that a litigious culture is not good, but if you think it's important for people to demand compensation for other people's negligence, then maybe you appreciate litigious behavior.</p></div>`;
