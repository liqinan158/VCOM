That's just a fancy way of saying that you've been handcuffed.</p><p class="long">Used as a noun, <i>manacle</i> is a synonym for shackle, meaning "a metal chain or band, used to fasten someone’s hands or ankles together." You’re more likely to see the noun form of this word in its plural form <i>manacles</i>, since — like socks or mittens — a pair is usually required. (Quite unlike socks or mittens, manacles are not at all comfortable or pleasant to wear.) You can say that someone who has been restrained using manacles has been manacled.</p></div></div>`;
