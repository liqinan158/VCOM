After you finish the collation of all those document pages, you might grab a quick collation. (That is, you deserve a light snack after all that organizing.) That's right, a <i>collation</i> is also "a light meal," usually cold, and often set out for people to take at their leisure. It sometimes refers to a small meal eaten on fasting days.</p></div></div>`;
