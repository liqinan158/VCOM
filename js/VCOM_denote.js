All of the googly-eyed looks that a girl gives to a boy might do more to <i>denote</i> her feelings for him than leaving a note in his locker.</p><p class="long"><i>Denote</i> comes from the Latin root <i>dēnotāre,</i> "to mark out." Using a particular facial expression can denote meaning, as in, "All of the crinkled foreheads and squinted eyebrows <i>denoted</i> a lack of understanding among the math students." Words and symbols also point to, or denote, meaning, "If he had used PST to <i>denote</i> the fact that he was in the Pacific time zone, she would have known that it was only 4:00 a.m. and too early to call from New York."</p></div></div>`;
