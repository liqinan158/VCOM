A magician might disappear in a <i>puff</i> of smoke — the kind that happens when you blow out a candle, not the kind that’s made of cheese.</p><p class="long">A puff of wind can spin a pinwheel or send a kite bobbing higher in the sky, and a tired runner's breath comes in puffs. There’s also the kind of puff that's inflated or stuffed and soft, like a puff of hair on grandma's head, a powder puff, or puff pastry, which is a thin, buttery dough that puffs up as it's baked. The Old English root is the imitative <i>pyffan</i>, "to blow with the mouth."</p></div></div>`;
