Your desire to grow your own fruits and vegetables in the backyard means you'll be engaged in some heavy <i>cultivation</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>cultivation</i> is most often used to talk about the ways that farmers take care of crops. However, in a more general sense, the verb <i>cultivate</i> means to improve or train someone or something. You could participate in the cultivation of your little brother by paying for him to take tango lessons and teaching him how to play chess. Or perhaps you might start by simply teaching him how to sip and not slurp his soup.</p></div></div>`;
