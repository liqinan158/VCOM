The tricky part, though, is that not all long animal noses are called <i>snouts</i>.</p><p class="long">An elephant has a very long nose, but we don't call it a <i>snout</i>, we call it a trunk. A horse's nose is rarely referred to as a <i>snout</i>, because it's really their whole face that's long. Birds have beaks. Most dogs have a snout, except for pugs and boxers and other dogs with smashed-in faces. Bears have snouts, as do rats. Do yourself a favor, though, and never tell a person that they have a snout, no matter how large their nose is. Believe it or not, <i>snout</i> may actually be a cousin of the word <i>snot</i>: that should help you remember it!</p></div>`;
