Then you can <i>incriminate</i> poor Fido for eating your homework. To <i>incriminate</i> someone (or some dog) of a crime, is more than just accusing them; it's offering some evidence they're guilty.</p><p class="long">To incriminate someone is to show or prove their guilt with "<i>incriminating</i> evidence." Some famous historical examples of incriminating evidence: When President Nixon declared "I am not a crook," those pesky Watergate tapes suggested otherwise. Or when Lady Macbeth couldn't stop washing her imaginary blood-stained hands? Hmmmm.... Pretty incriminating.</p></div></div>`;
