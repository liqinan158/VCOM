Its roots are Germanic, and come from the Old English <i>w√¶r</i> meaning "wary, cautious." <i>Awareness</i> can be something you notice, want to tell others about, or already know. You could "raise <i>awareness</i>" of a cause, like fighting breast cancer. Yet, your awareness of the baby sleeping next door might prevent you from having band practice in the garage.
