Many people with back yard swimming pools put <i>fences</i> around them to make sure small children don't fall in.</p><p class="long">The difference between a fence and a wall is that you can almost always see through a fence, at least to some degree, while a wall is solid. You can use <i>fence</i> as a verb too: "I think I'll <i>fence</i> my yard in, because my chickens keep wandering off." If someone calls you a fence, though, they mean you're selling stolen goods, and if you fence professionally, you participate in the sword fighting sport of <i>fencing</i>.</p></div></div>`;
