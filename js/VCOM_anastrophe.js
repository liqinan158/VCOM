Using <i>anastrophe</i> can sometimes make speech sound more formal.</p><p class="long">One of the most well-known users of anastrophe is the Star Wars character Yoda, whose mixed-up word order makes him sound wise and vaguely like a non-native English speaker: "Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is." It was common to use anastrophe as a literary device in ancient Greek and Latin poetry, and the word itself is Greek, meaning "a turning back" or "a turning upside-down."</p></div>`;
