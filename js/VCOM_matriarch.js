This noun can also be used metaphorically. For instance, Alice Waters could be called the <i>matriarch</i> of Chez Panisse and the generation of chefs that her revolutionary restaurant inspired.</p><p class="long">Although <i>matriarch</i> was created as a parallel term to <i>patriarch</i>, this eighteenth-century new creation was based on a false etymology. Although <i>patri-</i> might look related to the Latin <i>pater</i> "father," it actually comes from the Greek <i>patria</i> "family." Presumably, it was assumed that such a person would be a man. In any case, <i>patriarch</i> has come to mean the male head of a family or clan, while <i>matriarch</i> is used if the head of a family or clan is female.</p></div>`;
