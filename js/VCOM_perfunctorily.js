Similarly, to do something perfunctorily is to get it done without giving it much attention. A referee who does his job perfunctorily probably misses many calls. A teacher who teaches perfunctorily may grade student papers without reading them. A politician may shake hands perfunctorily, since he has to do it so often.</p></div></div>`;
