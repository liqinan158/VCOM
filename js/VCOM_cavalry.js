The only question is whether the cavalry is the traditional sort or if the word is being used more loosely. Traditionally, a cavalry is a unit of troops on horseback. When horses were a primary means of transportation, cavalries were a common part of war. Since then, a cavalry might be any unit of soldiers that can be quickly deployed.</p></div></div>`;
