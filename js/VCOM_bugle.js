The traditional bugle call is the series of notes used in military camps to signal daybreak and dusk, and sometimes other daily routines. <i>Bugle</i> was originally an Old French word meaning "musical horn," but also "wild ox" or "buffalo." The "horn" meaning came from the curled shape of an animal's horn.</p></div>`;
