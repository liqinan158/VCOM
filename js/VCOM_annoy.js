Your habit of constantly talking about your cats might <i>annoy</i> your friends more than you realize.</p><p class="long">When you <i>annoy</i> someone, you really rub them the wrong way. Often, the things that <i>annoy</i> people the most are those that are repeated again and again, like your habit of snorting every time you laugh or the screeching sound that your dishwasher makes day after day. Although the word <i>annoy</i> comes from the Latin phrase <i>esse in odio</i>, "it is hateful to me," its meaning now is less "hateful" and more "bothersome."</p></div></div>`;
