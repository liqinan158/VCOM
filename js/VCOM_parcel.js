It can also be a package or a collection of things wrapped together.</p><p class="long"><i>Parcel</i> comes from the Anglo-Norman word for "part." Often when we use <i>parcel</i> to mean a part, we're talking about land, which is divided into definable (and purchasable) tracts. As a verb, <i>parcel</i> means to divide something into parts, just as after trick-or-treating you might parcel your candy stash into piles of chocolates, peppermints, or toffees. If you're selling the family farm, you might parcel it into four small plots.</p></div></div>`;
