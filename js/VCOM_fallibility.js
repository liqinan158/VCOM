Your <i>fallibility</i> in guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar means you can't count on getting the number right and winning a prize.</p><p class="long">Fallibility is a quality that everyone has, since we all make misjudgments from time to time. You might remark on the fallibility of your little brother's plan to row a boat from Connecticut to Florida, especially if there's a hole in the boat and he's not a strong swimmer. The plan, in other words, has too many errors to work well. The Latin root is <i>fallibilis</i>, "liable to err or deceitful."</p></div>`;
