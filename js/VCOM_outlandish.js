Driving around the city in a golf cart and eating spaghetti with pineapple sauce are both examples of <i>outlandish</i> behavior.</p><p class="long">It's easy to imagine how the word <i>outlandish</i> originated. The Old English root is <i>utland</i>, which literally means "out-land," or foreign.  Now, it would be inappropriate to refer to a foreigner as outlandish, unless, say, he shows up to the office in a red patent-leather Speedo and a ten-gallon hat.</p></div>`;
