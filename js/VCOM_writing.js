Any time you record language in script, whether that's a tweet or the next great American novel, you're <i>writing</i>.</p><p class="long">If you promise your first-born son to the strange lady next door, she might say, "put it in writing," which means she's probably not a witch and relies on the law to get things done, because things written down are more binding than mere speech. You can also use <i>writing</i> to refer to the collected work of a single author or group. You might adore the writing of Mark Twain. Or do you prefer writing about vampires?</p></div></div>`;
