Such punishment is called <i>exile</i>. For example, after he was removed from power, Napoleon lived in <i>exile</i> on the island of Elba.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>exile</i> comes from the Old French word <i>essillier</i>, meaning “banish,” “expel,” or “drive off.” However, some people who live in exile do so happily — and voluntarily — like American citizens in exile in Paris. Don't confuse being exiled with being banned: <i>exile</i> is for countries. If you cause trouble at a restaurant, you might be banned from returning, not exiled.</p></div>`;
