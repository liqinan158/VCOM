A dictator's cruel regime is a monstrosity, and so is a three-headed fish. The word comes from the Latin word for monster, <i>monstrum</i>, with a root, <i>monere</i>, that means "warn," from the tradition of interpreting monstrous, deformed animals as omens — or warnings — of bad luck.</p></div>`;
