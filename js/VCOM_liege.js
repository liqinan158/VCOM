Such is the case with <i>liege</i>.  If you refer to someone as "my <i>liege</i>" you are probably playing a game.</p><p class="long">Ah, the Medieval era, where we find the word <i>liege</i> as we know it, a term used by underlings for the lord of their land. The word was probably of Germanic origin, derived from the Medieval Latin <i>laeticus</i>. In an interesting etymological twist, the word at one time meant a leader of a band of free men â€” pretty much the opposite of its eventual meaning as a feudal lord.  The word is not used much today, except in jest (see Python, Monty).</p></div>`;
