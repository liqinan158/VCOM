When a city's police set a new curfew, they <i>illegalize</i> kids and teenagers being out at night.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>illegalize</i> is a somewhat informal way to say "make something illegal." Your town might illegalize smoking in public places or your state senators could vote to illegalize dog fighting. In either case, something previously allowed is being made illegal. It's considered better grammar to say "make illegal," or even "criminalize," since <i>illegalize</i> is a relatively new verb constructed from <i>illegal</i>, "against the law," and the verb-forming suffix <i>ize</i>.</p></div></div>`;
