Vacuum cleaners <i>suck</i> dirt from the floor and milkshake drinkers <i>suck</i> this liquid, tasty liquid through a straw.</p><p class="long">Drinking something by pulling it into your mouth is to suck it. You can also suck on something, like a peppermint or a thumb, by holding it in your mouth. Objects can suck too â€” a fan sucks warm air out the window. You can also suck someone into your plans, meaning you force them to participate. The word <i>suck</i> comes from the Proto-Indo-European <i>sug</i>, from the sound your mouth makes when you suck on something.</p></div>`;
