A large piece of stone jutting from the earth is a <i>monolith</i>, and Detroit's economy when it depended entirely on the auto industry was <i>monolithic</i>.</p><p class="long">Broken into its roots <i>mono</i> and <i>lithic</i>, <i>monolithic</i> means simply "one stone." When <i>monolithic</i> is used to describe something societal — like a religion or an organization — it has a slightly negative connotation. For example, a monolithic society is rigid and homogenous, not open to new ideas. Being monolithic is good for rocks, but not so good for groups of people.</p></div>`;
