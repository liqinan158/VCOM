You can also see the ocean spread out in front of you, or spread butter on toast, for example. Any way you use it, <i>spread</i> implies an extension across some distance, a stretching of some sort. The expression <i>spread too thin</i> means you are having trouble finding the time and energy to do everything in your life.</p></div></div>`;
