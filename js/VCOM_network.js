The Internet is a <i>network</i> of computers all talking to one another. A subway is a <i>network</i> of interconnected train lines running underneath the city.</p><p class="long">A wise man once said that if the atom was the symbol of the 20th century, the <i>network</i> should be the symbol of the 21st. Increasingly our world relies on <i>networks</i>, the vast interconnected systems of people, electronics, ideas and even resources. To put pressure on any one part of a <i>network</i> is to put pressure on all parts, because, by definition, a <i>network</i> is interconnected. Whether the network is a television network, a cellular network, or a social network â€” each is a vast system of interconnected parts.</p></div></div>`;
