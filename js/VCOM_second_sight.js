Someone who claims to have <i>second sight</i> might call themselves a clairvoyant and hover over a crystal ball.</p><p class="long">If you saw something that was going to happen in the future, and then it actually occurred, you'd have second sight. It's one form of ESP, or extrasensory perception — the ability to see things that ordinary senses don't show. <i>Second sight</i> seems at first to be an odd name, since it means "the sight of events before they occur," — not afterward. Some believe it comes from the idea that physical sight comes first, and second sight develops later.</p></div>`;
