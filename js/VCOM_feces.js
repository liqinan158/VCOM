Everyone makes <i>feces</i>.</p><p class="long">Also called a <i>bowel movement</i> or <i>stool</i> — plus hundreds of terms in slang — feces is the solid waste material your body makes when you go number two. This isn't the word you'd probably use with your buddies, but it is the right word if you're writing a paper or talking to a teacher. Talking about feces can seem funny, but it's pretty important: if you couldn't make feces, you'd die.</p></div>`;
