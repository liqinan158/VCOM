People don't usually rest at a <i>rest stop</i>; they usually wait in long bathroom lines and consume fried food.</p><p class="long">In the US, we also call rest stops <i>rest areas</i>, <i>service areas</i>, or <i>travel plazas</i>, while in Britain they're called <i>motorway service areas</i> or <i>lay-bys</i>. These areas always provide room for cars to park temporarily, and they usually have restrooms, drinking fountains, and vending machines. Larger rest stops also have gas stations and fast food restaurants.</p></div></div>`;
