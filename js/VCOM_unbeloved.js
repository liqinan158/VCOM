So if you're feeling extremely unpopular, you can describe yourself as <i>unbeloved</i> — but it might be more constructive to join some clubs and meet new people.</p><p class="long">If someone or something is cherished, it's beloved. <i>Unbeloved</i> is the opposite — so you can use this adjective for anything that's not appreciated. There's your unbeloved early weekday alarm, for example, and the unbeloved family of mice that lives in your kitchen. Another way to use this word is for someone who loves but isn't loved in return: "My poor unbeloved dog just wants to be friends, but the cat doesn't feel the same way."</p></div>`;
