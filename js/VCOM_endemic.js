The saguaro cactus is <i>endemic</i>, or native, to the American southwest â€” so watch out for its sharp spines when you're hiking in Arizona!</p><p class="long">Although <i>endemic</i> meaning "prevalent" often describes a plant or disease, it can also refer to something less tangible and more unwanted such as violence or poverty. Many complain of endemic corruption in the local government. Despite its <i>-ic</i> ending, <i>endemic</i> can also be used as a noun to signify a plant or animal that is prevalent in a certain region. If an endemic is brought to another area which it takes over, destroying the local population, it's classified as an invasive species.</p></div>`;
