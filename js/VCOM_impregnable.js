We usually use it in reference to some form of protection, like a fort or a solid defensive line in football.</p><p class="long">The genealogy of the adjective <i>impregnable</i> includes the Middle French word <i>prenable</i>, meaning "vulnerable, easily conquered," which itself came from the verb <i>prendre</i>, which meant "to take." The addition of the negative prefix <i>im-</i> flipped the meaning. <i>Impregnable</i> can be used to describe anything that cannot be entered or successfully attacked. Seventeenth-century theater critic Jeremy Collier once said, "True courage is a result of reasoning. A brave mind is always impregnable."</p></div></div>`;
