The <i>viciousness</i> of your friends' argument might have startled you — usually, they get along well with each other.</p><p class="long">Someone with the trait of <i>viciousness</i> is guilty of acting in a deliberately cruel or callous way. Think of the viciousness of a brutal dictator, the viciousness of a bully, or the viciousness of nasty gossip that's meant to hurt someone deeply. <i>Viciousness</i> and <i>vicious</i> share a root with <i>vice</i>, or "wickedness," from the Latin <i>vitium</i>, "defect or offense" — which is fitting, as there's nothing more offensive than viciousness.</p></div>`;
