Amoebas use <i>pseudopods</i> to move around.</p><p class="long"><i>Pseudopod</i>, short for the Modern Latin <i>pseudopodium</i>, comes from the Greek roots <i>psuedo-</i>, "false or fake," and <i>podion</i>, "little foot." The cells that grow these tiny, fake feet (also described as "arm-like") use them as a temporary way of moving from one place to another, essentially by scooting or oozing along. Pseudopods are sometimes also used for feeding.</p></div>`;
