It's easy to imagine someone in the 1800s asking for a horse and carriage as their conveyance to a friend's house. Today, we'd skip the formalities and simply jump in the car and drive there ourselves. In its less common usage, a conveyance is a legal document that transfers ownership of a property from one person to another.</p></div>`;
