A <i>notion</i> is an idea, often vague and sometimes fanciful.</p><p class="long">A <i>notion</i> is lighter than a theory and embraces a whimsy that a simple idea never could. You might have the notion that you can slow global warming by taking public transportation and reusing plastic bags. If you share a far-fetched idea with others, someone might respond with a "Where'd you get that <i>notion</i>?!" <i>Notions</i> can also refer to the buttons, thread, zippers, and pins necessary for sewing things. So if you have a <i>notion</i> to create your own Halloween costume, you better pick up some <i>notions</i> from the craft store.</p></div>`;
