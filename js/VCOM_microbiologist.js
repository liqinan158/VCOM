Maybe you should consider being a <i>microbiologist</i>! A <i>microbiologist</i> is a scientist who studies very small organisms.</p><p class="long">These scientists study microscopic organisms including fungi, algae, the tiny flora that live in your digestive system, and viruses that make people sick. A microbiologist might work to identify bacteria that cause disease or ensure the food supply is free of harmful microorganisms. The word <i>microbiologist</i>, like <i>biologist</i>, is rooted in the Greek word for "life," <i>bios</i>, with the addition of the prefix <i>micro-</i>, "small."</p></div></div>`;
