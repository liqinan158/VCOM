Oops!</p><p class="long">The <i>ramifications</i> are the broader effects that fan out into the world from one situation, or decision, that kicks it all off. <i>Ramification</i> also refers to something branching out, like limbs on a tree â€” which is what bad decisions tend to do. <i>Ramification</i> is like <i>consequence</i>, but usually unintended and bad. The word is often used in political discussions about laws or government decisions because they might be made locally but could affect people worldwide.</p></div>`;
