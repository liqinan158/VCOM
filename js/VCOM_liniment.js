If you're sore after playing basketball all afternoon, you should put some <i>liniment</i> on your legs.</p><p class="long">Liniment can take various forms, from an oily lotion to a thick, waxy salve. Strictly speaking, a liniment is medicated and brings a feeling of heat to the skin, easing cramps and stiffness of the underlying muscles. The word was once a technical medical term, but today it's more likely to describe a homemade remedy. The Latin root of <i>liniment</i> is <i>linere</i>, "to smear."</p></div>`;
