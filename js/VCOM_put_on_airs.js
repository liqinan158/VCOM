If you wear a top hat and insist that everyone call you “sir” or “madam” while you boss them around, then you <i>put on airs</i>. And stop it.</p><p class="long">To <i>put on airs</i> has nothing to do with the stuff we breathe. Since the 1500s, “airs” has referred to having an affected manner. It’s from the French word <i>air</i>, "look, appearance, or bearing." Behaving as if you're better than other people — wealthier, better dressed, or better educated — is to put on airs. Acting like you know more than your teacher is a way to put on airs. It’s also a way to get in big trouble!</p></div>`;
