If you've just woken up in the midst of a lion's den, wearing nothing but raw meat pajamas — sounds like you could use some <i>succor</i>!</p><p class="long">In archaic times, <i>succor</i> meant a reinforcement of troops during a hard battle. These days though, those reinforcements are a bit more figurative. Succor is a helping hand in a time of need, relief when the going gets tough. <i>Succor</i> can also be used as a verb, as in, "After Bob fell overboard, he was saved — <i>succored</i> by a life preserver."</p></div>`;
