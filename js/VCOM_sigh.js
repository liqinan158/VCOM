No matter how much you <i>sigh</i> during your family's annual car trip to the Grand Canyon, your dad won't drive any faster.</p><p class="long">Something that sounds like a human sigh is also called a <i>sigh</i>. The breeze might sigh in the still night air, or a screen door might sigh closed. The word <i>sigh</i> comes from the Old English word of the same meaning, <i>sican</i>, which was probably imitative, echoing the sound of a sigh.</p></div></div>`;
