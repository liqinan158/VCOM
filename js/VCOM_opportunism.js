Opportunities are good things, but someone who pursues opportunities a little too eagerly is guilty of opportunism. Opportunism is a self-serving, self-centered approach to situations that disregards how others feel. Opportunism doesn't necessarily break the law, but it does violate manners and decency. Moving in on a dead person's wife is a classic example of opportunism. People who act this way are called opportunists.</p></div>`;
