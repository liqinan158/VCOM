Chess is another famous <i>board game</i>.</p><p class="long">As you would guess, board games are played on boards, but not any type of board. Most games have a specific board that's designed for that game. You can play chess and checkers on the same board, but games such as Risk, Clue, Operation, and Trivial Pursuit each have their own specially designed board. Some board games are aimed at very young children while others are far more complex. There's probably a board game for everyone.</p></div>`;
