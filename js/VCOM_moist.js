You might want to bring a blanket to sit on for a picnic, especially if it rained yesterday and the grass is still <i>moist</i>.</p><p class="long">Your houseplants are happiest when their soil is moist, and cake is most delicious if it's a little moist, not dry and crumbly. You can also describe your friend's eyes full of tears as moist, or the air on a densely foggy morning as moist. For some reason, the word <i>moist</i> frequently shows up on lists of "least favorite words," which makes more sense when you know its Latin root, <i>muscidus</i> — "moldy" or "slimy."</p></div>`;
