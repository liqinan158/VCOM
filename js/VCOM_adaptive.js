Being <i>adaptive</i> helps you sail along in today's ever-changing world.</p><p class="long">What do chameleons and your grandparents who only started using computers a few years ago have in common? They are adaptive. Just as chameleons change color to match their surroundings — green when sitting on leaves, brown when climbing the tree's trunk — your grandparents learned the skills to keep up with the world around them. The opposite of <i>adaptive</i> is <i>stubborn</i>. People, lizards, or anything that refuses to change are stubborn. To welcome change is to be adaptive.</p></div></div>`;
