The workers in an ambulance are <i>paramedics</i>.</p><p class="long">Just as a paralegal works with the law but isn't a lawyer, a paramedic is involved with medicine while not quite being a nurse or doctor. Rather, paramedics help doctors and nurses: paramedics are assistants. Paramedics are most well-known for working in ambulances. If you have a medical emergency — such as choking or a heart attack — paramedics will be there to help if you call 911. Paramedics save many lives every day.</p></div>`;
