Whether it’s the smog in the city, the atmosphere at your workplace, or a load of coal tar — they all sound <i>insalubrious</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>insalubrious</i> came into English in the seventeenth century from the Latin word <i>insalubris</i>, a combination of <i>in-</i>, meaning "not," and <i>salubris</i>, meaning "healthful." That makes for a decidedly unhealthy combination, and the word even has a slightly disreputable sound to it, like you’ve been out doing something you shouldn’t be doing. But at the same time it’s slightly formal, in part because it’s somewhat unusual in modern usage. Use it as a fancy way to describe something unhealthy that’s also a little bit common — like Las Vegas or fried chicken.</p></div>`;
