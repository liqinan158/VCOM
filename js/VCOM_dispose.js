var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">dispose</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If you <i>dispose</i> of something, you get rid of it. Don't want that sweatshirt with the clown's face on it? Give it away, throw it out, even sell it — these are all ways to <i>dispose</i> of that awful shirt.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>dispose</i> comes from the Latin word <i>disponere</i>, meaning “put in order,” “arrange,” or “distribute" — like when you dispose volunteers to collect trash at a park. The word <i>of</i> usually follows <i>dispose</i> when it means "getting rid of something." Another meaning is "make willing or open to something," like your childhood love of reading that disposes you to becoming a life-long reader.</p></div></div>`;
