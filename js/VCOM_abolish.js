So when the principal yells at you for the 100th time for not having your shirt tucked in, it's safe to wish they'd just <i>abolish</i> the silly dress code.</p><p class="long">The word <i>abolish</i> might stir up some historical connotations, since in the U.S. it's commonly associated with bringing an end to slavery. In fact, those who opposed slavery were called "abolitionists." The word comes to us from the Latin word <i>abolere</i>, meaning "to destroy or cause to die out." These days <i>abolish</i> is used bring a final and official-sounding end to laws, codes, and unsavory practices.</p></div></div>`;
