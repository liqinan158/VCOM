If you only have a short <i>lunch</i> break during your school or work day, you might quickly eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.</p><p class="long">The size of your lunch depends on what country you live in. In the US, most people eat a small lunch and a larger dinner at the end of the day. The word is a somewhat fancy verb, too: "Shall we <i>lunch</i> at the club, or have the cook make us something at home?" <i>Lunch</i> is a shortened version of <i>luncheon</i>, which may stem from the earlier dialectical <i>lunch</i>, "hunk of bread and cheese."</p></div></div>`;
