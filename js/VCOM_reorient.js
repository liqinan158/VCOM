Reorient can also be used figuratively. You got off track with your college plans, but now you have <i>reoriented</i> yourself, and you are applying for the fall semester.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>reorient</i> has <i>orient</i> as its base. <i>Orient</i> is from the Latin word <i>orientem</i>, which refers to the sun rising in the East. In fact the verb <i>orient</i> meant to face East, so <i>reorient</i> literally means to face East again. Today, <i>reorient</i> is to adjust to new circumstances or positions. The curriculum will reorient student learning goals, but it also means you have to learn the new, new, new math.</p></div></div>`;
