You can also use <i>flush</i> as an adjective to mean "lined up" or "level," like when you hang a medicine cabinet in your bathroom, making sure it's flush against the wall. Yet another meaning of a <i>flush</i> is a peak or boom â€” a professional poker player might describe her period of winning game after game as a flush.</p></div></div>`;
