You know: the girl shushing everyone at a sleepover party, the kid who refuses to play when it comes their turn to be "it."</p><p class="long">Back before it meant organized athletics, <i>sport</i> meant games or joking. Instead of making fun of someone, you'd be "making <i>sport</i>" of them. So someone who spoils or wrecks the fun or sport of others is a <i>spoilsport</i>. Calling someone a <i>spoilsport</i>, though, is often just a way to pressure them to do something everyone knows is wrong.</p></div></div>`;
