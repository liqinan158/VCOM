It also can be used to mean the highest point in a figurative sense. An actor who wins an Oscar can say she's reached the apex of her career. If you're describing more than one high point, you could add an <i>-es</i> to form the plural <i>apexes</i>, but <i>apices</i> would also be correct. And if you're a botanist, you'd probably use <i>apex</i> to describe the tip of a flower or leaf.</p></div>`;
