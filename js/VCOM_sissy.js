They're also implying that there is something weak and fearful about being a girl or a woman â€” it's the same as telling a boy, "You throw like a girl." It's unkind and also inaccurate. <i>Sissy</i> comes from <i>sister</i>, and its earliest use to mean "effeminate man" was in the late 1800s.</p></div></div>`;
