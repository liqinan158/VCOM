Contemporaries are people and things from the same time period. <i>Contemporary</i> can also describe things happening now or recently. It's common to speak of contemporary music or contemporary furniture, for example. Those things are new, not old. Anything characteristic of the present day can be called <i>contemporary</i>.</p></div></div>`;
