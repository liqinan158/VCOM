In the United States, when you turn eighteen, you may join the <i>electorate</i> and help choose a president.</p><p class="long">The word <i>electorate</i> is especially important for those people who are not a part of it. For instance, women in the United States were not part of the electorate until they were allowed to vote in 1920. Being a part of the electorate is important because it gives you a chance to <i>elect</i> — or choose — who you want to represent you in your government.</p></div></div>`;
