If you unexpectedly find someone dressed up as a vampire in your closet in the middle of a dark night, you might well experience feelings of <i>terror</i>.</p><p class="long">If you feel terror, you are frozen to the spot in fear. This is the goal of terrorists who use terror as a weapon —  they create a climate of fear and mistrust so that people are afraid to go about their normal lives. You will recognize this use in the phrase “the war on <i>terror</i>.” You can also call a difficult  or scary person, often a child who causes havoc, a terror or a holy terror.</p></div>`;
