Usually, a large, powerful country <i>colonizes</i> a territory or area that's much less powerful.</p><p class="long">There are many examples through history of powerful countries that colonized various regions of the world in order to gain natural resources or to obtain more land for their citizens to live in. When this happens, it's rarely good news for the people who lived there already. <i>Colonize</i> and <i>colony</i> come from the Latin <i>colonus</i>, "tenant farmer" or "settler in new land," from the root <i>colere</i>, "to cultivate, till, or inhabit."</p></div></div>`;
