Scientists use strobes to study the way things oscillate, vibrate, or rotate. Nightclubs use strobes to make dancers appear as though they're moving in slow motion, and car mechanics use them to improve a car engine's efficiency by measuring its rotation. The Greek root <i>strobos</i> means "a twisting."</p></div>`;
