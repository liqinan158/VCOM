If you're looking for a picnic spot, the wide, green canopy of a <i>willow</i> provides great shade on a hot summer day.</p><p class="long">Most willow trees grow near water or in damp locations, as their roots soak up great quantities of moisture and can be used to protect the banks of rivers and streams from erosion. Willow branches are also commonly woven together to make baskets. A "weeping willow" has distinctive, graceful branches that curve down toward the ground.</p></div></div>`;
