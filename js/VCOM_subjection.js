A dictator's power lies in his <i>subjection</i> of the people over whom he rules.</p><p class="long">Many kinds of control can be called <i>subjection</i>, but it most often describes a political rule or the subjugation of a large group of people. Slavery is one terrible, extreme type of subjection, and a king's conquering of a neighboring kingdom is another type. <i>Subjection</i> comes from the Old French <i>subjection</i>, "submission, inferior condition, or captivity," with a Latin root, <i>subjectionem</i>, a putting under."</p></div></div>`;
