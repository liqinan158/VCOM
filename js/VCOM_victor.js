Calling someone the <i>victor</i> implies that he or she triumphed in a difficult competition.</p><p class="long">The origin of the noun <i>victor</i> is in the Latin word <i>vincere</i>, meaning “conquer.” If you conquer your opponents, in a weekend-long chess showdown, the wrestling match, the beauty contest, the debate, or a 5K run, you are the victor. It means you won — victory is yours. Whenever an opponent is defeated, the winner is the victor.</p></div>`;
