They're <i>enervating:</i> in other words, they completely drain you of physical and emotional energy.</p><p class="long">A little different from similar words like <i>debilitating</i> or <i>enfeebling,</i> which primarily suggest physical fatigue; the wonderful <i>enervating</i> implies all that plus the terrible erosion of your soul. Not surprisingly, <i>enervate</i> is derived from the Latin <i>enervatus,</i> meaning "to weaken."</p></div></div>`;
