The Parliament of Finland, for example, is <i>unicameral</i>.</p><p class="long">Some governments are split into two houses â€” these are called bicameral legislatures. When there is only one house, usually because the government is small or the country is homogeneous, it's called unicameral. Having a unicameral government is simpler and more straightforward, while a bicameral legislature can represent more diverse groups. The word <i>unicameral</i> has two Latin roots, <i>uni</i>, which means "one," and <i>camera</i>, "chamber."</p></div></div>`;
