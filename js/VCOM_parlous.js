It means dangerous â€” something that is parlous might carry the risk or threat of harm, like a parlous experience of being in a boat during a rainstorm. <i>Parlous</i> and <i>perilous</i> are synonyms. In fact, <i>parlous</i> is a shortened version, or contraction, of <i>perilous</i> that came about in the late 14th century.</p></div></div>`;
