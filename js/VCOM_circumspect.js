A good quality in someone entrusted with responsibility, though sometimes boring in a friend.</p><p class="long">The word <i>circumspect</i> was borrowed from Latin <i>circumspectus</i>, from <i>circumspicere</i>, "to be cautious." The basic meaning of Latin <i>circumspicere</i> is "to look around." Near synonyms are <i>prudent</i> and <i>cautious</i>, though <i>circumspect</i> implies a careful consideration of all circumstances and a desire to avoid mistakes and bad consequences.</p></div>`;
