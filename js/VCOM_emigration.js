Emigration often happens when people leave their native country to seek a better life in another country. For example, maybe your great-grandparents left Ireland to settle in Albany, NY, where they worked for the railroad. Remember that <i>emigration</i> refers to leaving a country. <i>Immigration</i> refers to entering a new country.</p></div>`;
