A <i>sally</i> sometimes has the advantage of taking the opposing army by surprise.</p><p class="long">When soldiers who have been on the defensive, having retreated to a foxhole or fort, make an abrupt offensive attack on their opponents, it's a sally. Another word for this kind of sally is a <i>sortie</i>. You can also call a sudden funny remark or comeback a sally, especially during a witty, back-and-forth, or bantering kind of conversation. The word comes from the Middle French <i>saillie</i>, "a rushing forth," from the Latin <i>salire</i>, "to leap."</p></div>`;
