For example, the <i>crisis</i> caused by a natural disaster might inspire you and your friends to make a donation.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>crisis</i> comes from the Latinized form of the Greek word <i>krisis,</i> meaning "turning point in a disease." At such a moment, the person with the disease could get better or worse: it's a critical moment. Think of a celebrity whose recent antics generate headlines like "Rock Star in Crisis" — that person needs help that may or may not be sought. At the moment of crisis, things are unstable and maybe even dangerous.</p></div>`;
