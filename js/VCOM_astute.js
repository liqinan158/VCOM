It differs from its synonym <i>shrewd</i> in placing less emphasis on hardheadedness than on sensitivity: we talk about a <i>shrewd</i> bargainer but an <i>astute</i> interpretation. Other synonyms are <i>perceptive</i> (emphasizing insight) and <i>discerning</i> (emphasizing an ability to distinguish).</p></div>`;
