People who say they hate cars but always beg you for a ride? They are engaging in <i>hypocrisy</i>, or behavior that is different from what they say they believe.</p><p class="long">A <i>hypocrite</i> is a person who practices <i>hypocrisy</i>: what they say is not what they do. The noun <i>hypocrisy</i> descends from the Greek <i>hypokrisis</i> "acting on a stage," from <i>hypokrinesthai</i> "to play a part, pretend," from the prefix <i>hypo-</i> "under" plus <i> krinein</i> "to judge." Many times kids are enraged by their parents' hypocrisy when parents make their children follow rules they don't follow themselves.</p></div></div>`;
