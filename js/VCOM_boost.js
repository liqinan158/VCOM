Maybe you need a <i>boost</i> getting over a fence (hmm — are you sneaking in or sneaking out?), or maybe you are feeling low and need to <i>boost</i> your spirits — chocolate, anyone?</p><p class="long">Sometimes words appear that really don't have any clear origins. <i>Boost</i> is one of those words, but it's a fun word, and it's thought that maybe it has some connection to <i>boose</i>, a Scots dialect word that carries the idea of a push.  A slang meaning of the word is to sneakily steal, like shoplifting.  You gave your cousin a boost into the window, not knowing he was planning on boosting some sneakers.</p></div></div>`;
