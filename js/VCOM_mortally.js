If your guinea pig is <i>mortally</i> ill, it unfortunately means that he's certain to die.</p><p class="long">You're most likely to come across the adverb <i>mortally</i> followed by the word "wounded." For example, a wildlife biologist might describe finding an injured owl that turned out to be mortally wounded, or hurt so badly that it later died. The key to this meaning is the word <i>mortal</i> at the heart of <i>mortally</i> â€” it means "doomed to die," from the Latin root <i>mortalis</i>, "subject to death, mortal, or human."</p></div>`;
