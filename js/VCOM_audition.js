If you bomb the <i>audition</i>, you probably won't make it into the cast.</p><p class="long">When describing a tryout in which an actor, singer, musician, or dancer tries to prove that he or she is talented enough to earn a part in a show, <i>audition</i> is used as a noun. The word can also be used as a verb, as in, "I <i>auditioned</i> for the part of Peter Pan, but every time I tried to fly I fell flat on my face." <i>Audition</i> shares a common heritage with <i>audience</i>, the group of people who will eventually watch the show for which a performer has auditioned. Both words come from the Middle French term meaning "power of hearing."</p></div>`;
