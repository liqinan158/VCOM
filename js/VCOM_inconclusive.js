If your data about a flu outbreak is <i>inconclusive</i>, then your results don't prove anything.</p><p class="long">A good way to remember the meaning of <i>inconclusive</i> is to look at the root word <i>conclusive</i>, which means "definitive, decisive, and convincing." When you add <i>in-</i> — which means "not" — to the front of <i>conclusive</i>, you get a word that means "not definitive."  When something's inconclusive, it doesn't resolve your questions and leaves room for debate. If you're a detective, the last thing you want to hear is that your evidence is inconclusive.</p></div></div>`;
