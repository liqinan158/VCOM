Picture a pirate's telescopic spyglass, one type of telescope, which expands so the pirate can peer through it. If you use a camera with a telescopic lens, don’t stand too close to your subject because the lens might bonk them in the nose. <i>Telescopic</i> also describes something that’s only visible with a telescope, like a far-away star.</p></div>`;
