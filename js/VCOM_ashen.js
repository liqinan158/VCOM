Your best friend might look <i>ashen</i> when he hears that his favorite baseball team traded its star player.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>ashen</i> was first used to describe ashes, the powdery substance left over when something burns, but it soon came to mean things that have the same pale, lifeless color as ashes. Like wood or coal that starts out brown or black and loses all color in the ashes that remain, things that are ashen are pale, washed out, or even colorless. <i>Ashen</i> is most often applied to the complexions of those facing stressful situations.</p></div>`;
