This presents a problem if your current car is deficient in some way––say, it no longer has enough engine power to drive up a hill. You may not feel you have what it takes to get a job, but the reality is you will have to chose between indulging your own <i>deficiencies</i> in this area or the car's.</p></div></div>`;
