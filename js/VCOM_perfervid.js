Your <i>perfervid</i> speeches begging your parents to get a dog may do no good if they're both allergic.</p><p class="long">When feelings are impassioned and intense, they're perfervid. The word's Latin root, <i>fervidus</i>, means "glowing or burning," and it also gave rise to the adjective <i>fervid</i>, "intensely enthusiastic or passionate." <i>Perfervid</i> doubles down on that emotion by adding the prefix <i>per-</i>, "utterly or completely." So use it when your feelings are at their most intense: "The perfervid protesters demanded to be heard."</p></div>`;
