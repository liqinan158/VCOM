It's the opposite of a warm welcome.</p><p class="long">Warmth is associated with love, while coldness is associated with indifference. Also, turning your shoulder to someone is the opposite body language of a hug. That might help you remember why the cold shoulder refers to chilly treatment of someone you know. If you say hi to someone and they don't say hi back, you got the cold shoulder. When someone tries to make eye contact and you pretend not to see them, you're giving the cold shoulder.</p></div></div>`;
