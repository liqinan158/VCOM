A <i>sloth</i> is actually a slow-moving, tree-dwelling mammal, but it has become a synonym for "lazybones."</p><p class="long"><i>Slug</i> also doubles as the name of an animal and a term for someone who is lazy, slow or lethargic. But with <i>slug,</i> the animal name probably morphed into the human application, whereas sloth has meant "lazy person" or "laziness" for a long time. In the Catholic Church <i>sloth</i> was categorized as one of the seven deadly sins.</p></div>`;
