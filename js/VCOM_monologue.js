In theatre, sometimes a character has a monologue that they perform.  You might have an internal monologue where you talk to yourself to better understand some dilemma. Some people talk forever in a constant monologue, never letting you speak.  If two people talk back and forth, it’s a <i>dialogue</i>, which is different and probably more fun for everyone.</p></div></div>`;
