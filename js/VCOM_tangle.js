You might have a <i>tangle</i> of cords behind your computer or a <i>tangle</i> of complications related to your taxes. Whatever it is, once something is in a <i>tangle</i>, it's difficult to sort out.</p><p class="long">The word <i>tangle</i> likely originated from a Scandinavian source — <i>taggla</i>, in a Swedish dialect, means “disarrange.” <i>Tangle</i> also can be used as a verb: you may tangle your hair as a fashion statement, but then it hurts to comb it out. As a noun, <i>tangle</i> can refer to an argument or a fight between two people: if you're really feisty, people might be warned away from getting into a tangle with you.</p></div></div>`;
