If you aspire to be a competitive ballroom dancer, you'll need to master the <i>waltz</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Waltz</i> is also a verb, so couples may waltz around the ballroom while the band plays a waltz. When you waltz, you face your dance partner with one hand on their waist or shoulder and the other clasping their hand. The two of you move in a gliding spin. It its earliest days, the waltz was considered a bit shockingâ€”previous dances were "open," with couples side by side, rather than "closed," with dancers facing each other.</p></div></div>`;
