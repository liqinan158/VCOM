You might <i>expostulate</i> with your little brother, objecting to his plan to jump off the roof into a pile of leaves.</p><p class="long">Someone who expostulates has strong opinions about other people's plans or ideas and a desire to convince them to change their minds. You might expostulate about your town's new law banning dogs from coffee shops, arguing against it in a letter to the local newspaper. <i>Expostulate</i> comes from the Latin root word <i>expostulare</i>, meaning "to demand urgently." The English word still contains this urgency, with an added sense of persuasion and reasoned argument.</p></div></div>`;
