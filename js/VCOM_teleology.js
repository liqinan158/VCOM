When you see things in terms of <i>teleology</i>, you explain actions by their results.</p><p class="long">We can trace the origin of <i>teleology</i> to the Greeks: to <i>teleos</i>, meaning "complete," and its  root <i>telos</i>, meaning "result." Then we add the suffix <i>-logy</i>, which means "logic," or "reason." The philosophy itself suggests that acts are done with a foregone purpose in mind â€” people do things knowing the result they wish to achieve. As Aristotle said, "Nature does nothing in vain."  So far, there's no teleology to explain why you haven't left the couch for several hours.</p></div></div>`;
