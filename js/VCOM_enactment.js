The <i>enactment</i> of new legislation in your town means that you'll now have to keep your dog on a leash in all public parks.</p><p class="long"><i>Enactment</i> comes from the verb <i>enact</i>, which has long been used to mean "establish as law." This legal terminology has "act" at its center, meaning both "to do" and "written proof of something that's been said, done, or agreed to." Legitimizing this kind of act as law is where <i>enactment</i> comes in. You can also use this word for the resulting law itself: "The enactment doesn't affect me â€” I never let my dog off her leash anyway."</p></div></div>`;
