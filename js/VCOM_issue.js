It is <i>issued</i>, or put out, by the publisher. You and your mother may argue over the <i>issue</i>, or topic, of whether or not you should read it.</p><p class="long">The original meaning of the word <i>issue</i> was to put something out. If a celebrity issues a statement or the post office issues new stamps, they put them out for the public. Likewise, an issue is a current topic, sometimes controversial, that is being discussed. Politicians often say they want to talk about the issues (and not their personal lives!). You might hear someone say, "He's got <i>issues</i>" about a person who has some problems, usually emotional ones, but this is a very new use for the word.</p></div></div>`;
