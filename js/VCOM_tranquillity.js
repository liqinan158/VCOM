It is the feeling you have while sitting under a starry sky, listening to the crickets. The aura of tranquility comes from the calm in the world, which makes you feel you are without a care in the world.</p><p class="long"><i>Tranquillity</i> is also sometimes spelled with one <i>l</i> as tranquility. Its roots are in the Latin <i>trans</i> meaning "exceedingly" and <i>quies</i> meaning "rest" or "quiet." Tranquil means calm, and something that is exceedingly quiet or restful — a sunset or a rocking chair in the shade — can give you a sense of tranquillity or peacefulness.</p></div></div>`;
