If you plan to study <i>lepidopterology</i>, you might go to college and major in zoology or biology.</p><p class="long">People who study insects call their specialty <i>entomology</i>, and when an entomologist focuses specifically on insects with scaly wings that hatch from caterpillars, she calls her field <i>lepidopterology</i>. One of the most famous amateur lepidopterology enthusiasts was the writer Vladimir Nabokov, who collected butterfly specimens throughout his life. The word itself comes from the Greek roots <i>lepido</i>, "scale," and <i>pteron</i>, "wing or feather."</p></div>`;
