var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">peaceably</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Doing something <i>peaceably</i> means acting in a calm, nonviolent way. You might describe a group of protesters as standing <i>peaceably</i> in front of City Hall, singing and chanting and they lobby for change.</p><p class="long">Generally, <i>peaceably</i> can be used as a synonym for "peacefully," at least when you're describing people or groups of people as acting peaceably (you probably wouldn't say a bird sang peaceably, for example). Behaving peaceably means you're actively encouraging peace rather than conflict. In your dense neighborhood, it may require some compromise and understanding to live together peaceably.</p></div>`;
