Fashion critics may think that wearing white shoes after Labor Day is a <i>felony</i>, but it isnâ€™t really.</p><p class="long">A felony is sometimes called a "high crime" because it's so serious. A felony differs from a misdemeanor in the amount of punishment someone gets when convicted. In the United States, a felony is a crime that has a sentence of more than a year in prison. A year or less in jail means the crime is just a misdemeanor. If you're convicted of a felony, even after you serve your time you may be denied certain rights and privileges.</p></div>`;
