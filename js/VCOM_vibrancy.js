The very best singers bring <i>vibrancy</i> to their performances.</p><p class="long">Sounds with vibrancy are strong and resonant. You could describe the echoing sound a gong makes as having vibrancy, or the powerful voices of a large choir singing in unison. The noun <i>vibrancy</i> comes from the adjective <i>vibrant</i>, which means "strong and resonating" or "full of enthusiasm and energy." In the 1550's, <i>vibrant</i> meant "agitated," from a Latin root of <i>vibrantem</i>, "swaying to and fro." There's a strong connection between <i>vibrancy</i> and <i>vibrate</i>, or "resonate."</p></div>`;
