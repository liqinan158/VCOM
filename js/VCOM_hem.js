The <i>hem</i> is the very bottom, folded edge of a piece of clothing.</p><p class="long">Most of your clothes have at least one hem in them â€” at the ends of your sleeves, the bottom of your skirt, or along the edge of your t-shirt. When a person sews a hem, whether he's making a dress or a pair of curtains, he folds a very small amount of fabric under two or three times and stitches along the edge in a straight line. In Old English, the word <i>hem</i> means "a border."</p></div>`;
