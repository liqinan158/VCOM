You play a <i>trombone</i> by blowing in the mouthpiece and moving the slide.</p><p class="long">A trombone looks a bit like an extra-long trumpet, and in fact the word comes from the Italian <i>tromba</i>, "trumpet," and the suffix <i>-one</i>, "large." Like trumpet players, trombone players (also called <i>trombonists</i>) use <i> embouchure</i>, a method of holding the mouth, lips, tongue, and teeth as they blow into the mouthpiece.</p></div>`;
