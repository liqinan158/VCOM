Likewise, a person with a <i>parochial</i> mentality is narrow-minded, or not open to new ideas.</p><p class="long"><i>Parochial</i> comes to English from Greek through Latin with the meaning "of a parish." As a parochial school is a school that is affiliated with a particular church, the connection is easy to see. In general though, <i>parochial</i> refers to a narrow or limited point of view â€” that is, an outlook that extends no further than the limits of the parish. You may feel that there is no room in your life for the parochial attitudes of the older generation. Let's hope you remain open-minded as you age!</p></div></div>`;
