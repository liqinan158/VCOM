Your mom might use the <i>metaphoric</i> phrase "disaster area" when she talks about your bedroom.</p><p class="long">Metaphoric speech or writing emphasizes the similarities between two fundamentally different things, by having one stand for, or represent, the other. For example, the famous line in the play "As You Like It" by Shakespeare, "All the world's a stage," is metaphoric — "a stage" is a metaphor for "all the world." You can also use the adjective <i>metaphorical</i> to mean the same thing. The Greek root of both is <i>metaphora</i>, "a transfer" or "a carrying over."</p></div></div>`;
