If you are a truly <i>liberated</i> dresser, you don't feel any pressure to wear conservative clothes just because that's what everyone else does.</p><p class="long">A liberated woman refers to a feminist who pushes for more equality for women. In the 1960s, a wave of liberated women fought sexism in culture and politics and tried to change expectations of what women should be both inside and outside the home. <i>Liberated</i> can also describe something that's freed from occupation by an enemy. For example, a country might be liberated from guerilla rule by UN forces.</p></div></div>`;
