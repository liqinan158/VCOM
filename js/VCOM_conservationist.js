Some <i>conservationists</i> clean seabirds after oil spills in the ocean, while others are teachers who educate students about environmental issues.</p><p class="long">If you care about preserving wildlife and the environment, you might want to be a conservationist. As a job, this can mean working as a wildlife biologist, an environmental political lobbyist, a forestry technician, or a park ranger â€” all professions that involve the care and protection of land, waters, and animals. You're also a conservationist if you volunteer at a local wildlife rehabilitation center or regularly call your state representatives to encourage their votes on environmental legislation.</p></div></div>`;
