You probably don't enjoy eating out with your parents if they're always <i>dissatisfied</i> with the food they order.</p><p class="long">You might be dissatisfied with the final episode of your favorite TV show, or dissatisfied with your grades n German last semester. In either case, you're not pleased. A slightly different way to be dissatisfied is to be unconvinced: "She was <i>dissatisfied</i> with the answer he gave when she asked when he planned to pay back the money he owed her." <i>Dissatisfied</i> combines <i>dis-</i>, "not," and <i>satisfied</i>, from a Latin root, <i>satisfacere</i>, "do enough."</p></div></div>`;
