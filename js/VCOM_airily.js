You might hide your excitement at meeting a movie star by airily saying, "Oh, hi."</p><p class="long">If you speak or behave airily, you give the impression that you don't really care. If a local politician responds airily to a citizen's legitimate concerns about crime, she's likely to suffer some criticism for not taking her constituents seriously enough. <i>Airily</i> comes from <i>airy</i>, originally defined as "with ostentatious air."</p></div></div>`;
