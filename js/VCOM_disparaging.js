var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">disparaging</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you are <i>disparaging</i>, you express negative, low opinions in order to lower someone's reputation. Your friend will probably not appreciate it if you make <i>disparaging</i> comments about his girlfriend.</p><p class="long">In its original use, <i>disparage</i> meant "to marry unequally," and it was considered a disgrace if a very wealthy son married, say, the kitchen maid. Nowadays we use <i>disparaging</i> for any derogatory or belittling expression or comment. If you just won an Olympic gold medal, it's just rude and unnecessary to be disparaging about the silver medalist in an interview. Making disparaging remarks about your friend's cooking is unlikely to result in better food â€” he'll just get mad.</p></div>`;
