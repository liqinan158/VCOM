When you sit on the couch, sighing and looking sad because you didn't get invited to your friend's party, you are sitting there <i>morosely</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Morose</i> means gloomy or in a bad mood, so whenever the adverb <i>morosely</i> describes your actions, you're not feeling very cheerful. There is an element of crankiness in the word <i>morosely</i>, which you can even see it its Latin root, <i>morosus</i>, which means "peevish". So when you do something morosely, you're not just sad, but you're making sure everyone knows how you're feeling.</p></div>`;
