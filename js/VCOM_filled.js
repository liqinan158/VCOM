And a filled calendar doesn't have any time for more appointment slots. This adjective is sometimes used interchangeably with "full," but it's more likely to describe a food item that's stuffed full of some kind of filling, from filled pasta shells to filled pastries, or to substitute for "fulfilled," like your filled online order for cat food.</p></div></div>`;
