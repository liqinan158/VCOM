A stone mason is a <i>laborer</i>, but you probably wouldn't call a poet a <i>laborer</i>.</p><p class="long">In the old days, the word <i>laborer</i> implied an unskilled or menial worker, like a day laborer on a farm who might be hired at an hourly rate to haul rocks out of a field, or a street paver's assistant. Today, a laborer is thought of as someone who works with her hands, often outside. <i>Laborer</i> comes from <i>labor</i>, in Old French "work, exertion, or task," from the Latin <i>laborem</i>, "toil, exertion, or fatigue."</p></div></div>`;
