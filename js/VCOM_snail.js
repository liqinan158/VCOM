There are three general categories of snails: land snails, sea snails, and freshwater snails. They all have shells that they can retreat withinâ€”without a shell, a similar animal is instead called a <i>slug</i>. <i>Snail</i> can be traced back to the diminutive form of the Old English <i>snaca</i>, "snake" or "creeping thing."</p></div>`;
