It's the critical thinking skill that allows you to "think outside the box" to come up with original solutions to problems.</p><p class="long">We often think of <i>creativity</i> as limited to the arts, but it is a necessary element in all areas of life. Without creativity we would not have the mathematical theories that presented us with fractals, or the technological imagination that could foresee people walking on the moon. It was <i>creativity</i> that harnessed lightning into electricity and later used that electricity to send messages through wires. Without <i>creativity</i>, we probably would never have invented the wheel or domesticated fire!</p></div></div>`;
