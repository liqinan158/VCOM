You and your brother might be a popular sidewalk <i>duet</i> with your fiddle-accordion combo.</p><p class="long">If you have tickets for a musical duet, you'll be watching and listening to two performers. You can also call the composition that's written for the two of them a <i>duet</i>, since it has parts for two instruments. Two dancers can also perform a duet, a dance especially choreographed for a couple. <i>Duet</i> stems from the Italian <i>duetto</i>, "musical composition for two voices," from <i>duo</i>, or "two."</p></div></div>`;
