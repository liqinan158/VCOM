It's not safe to eat fish caught in a <i>polluted</i> river.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>polluted</i> is obviously a close relative to <i>pollute</i> and <i>pollution</i>, so you know that polluted air or water isn't clean. All of these words come from the Latin <i>polluere</i>, "to soil or defile," from a combination of <i>por-</i>, "before," and <i>-luere</i>, "to smear." A polluted city can result from a coal-burning factory, and things can also be figuratively polluted: "Fear of outsiders created a <i>polluted</i> society."</p></div>`;
