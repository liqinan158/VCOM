Examples of <i>impudence</i>? Not tipping the waiter, sticking your tongue out, tripping your grandmother — you get the picture.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>impudence</i> is derived from the Latin <i>impudentia,</i> "shamelessness." Being rude is a main trait of impudence; another is doing something you're not supposed to do — usually with an attitude that shows you don't care. When you are acting with impudence, you are usually overstepping your boundaries — like a kid who challenges his parents and can't accept "Because I said so!" as a reason for discipline.</p></div>`;
