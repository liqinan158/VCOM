Do you work? Your <i>motivation</i> is your paycheck. Lost something? Finding it may provide <i>motivation</i> to tidy the house.</p><p class="long">At the root of the word <i>motivation</i> is the word <i>motive</i>, which is similarly defined as the reason for a particular action. Although the words are synonyms, when it comes to criminal behavior, people generally ask about the motives leading to the criminal acts, not the motivation behind them. Other synonyms for <i>motivation</i> include <i>inspiration</i> and <i>enthusiasm</i>, so people tend to associate <i>motivation</i> with positive acts.</p></div></div>`;
