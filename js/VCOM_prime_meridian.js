Slicing the earth along the circle of the prime meridian would divide it into the Eastern and Western hemispheres — but it’s probably better to leave it in tact.</p><p class="long">Sometimes called the <i>Greenwich Meridian</i> or the <i>International Meridian</i>, Earth’s <i>prime meridian</i> crosses the original site of the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England. It is the circular line by which other longitudinal lines, or <i>meridians</i>, are referenced — otherwise it wouldn’t be <i>prime</i>. You can still have a prime meridian without Greenwich, England, though; you just need to be on the moon, Jupiter, or some other celestial body.</p></div>`;
