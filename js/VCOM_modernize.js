You might <i>modernize</i> your grandmother's kitchen by buying her a microwave and an espresso machine.</p><p class="long">When you <i>modernize</i> something, you bring it up to date. You could modernize your office by buying new computers, for example, or modernize your antique car by installing seat belts and a stereo. At the heart of <i>modernize</i> is the adjective <i>modern</i>, "relating to the present time" or "up-to-date." In Shakepeare, the word <i>modern</i> is often used to mean "ordinary," although today there's more of a sense of "the very latest technology."</p></div></div>`;
