If after spending an hour in your brother's room, you stop noticing the stinky-sock smell, you have become <i>inured</i> to the odor.</p><p class="long">Although the Latin roots of <i>inure</i> mean "in work," it may be easier to think of  "in use" when you see <i>inure</i>. Got new shoes that give you blisters? When they are "in use" long enough, your feet will become inured to the spots that rub, and while you may have calluses, you will not be in pain. You can be inured to more abstract things too. When weathermen constantly play up the next big snowstorm or blizzard, you become inured to it and stop paying attention to them.</p></div>`;
