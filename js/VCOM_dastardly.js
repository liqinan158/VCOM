A superhero might try to protect a city from a <i>dastardly</i> criminal mastermind.</p><p class="long">Use the adjective <i>dastardly</i> to describe a person or action that's underhanded and mean. Criminals, pirates, and bullies are all frequently called dastardly. An unprovoked military strike is also sometimes described as <i>dastardly</i>, referencing President Franklin Roosevelt's famous 1941 speech after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which he called an "unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan." In the 1500s, <i>dastardly</i> meant "dull," from the now-obsolete <i>dastard</i>, "one who is lazy or dull."</p></div></div>`;
