An actor who's getting ready for his cue to stride onstage and say, "To be or not to be!" stands <i>offstage</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Offstage</i> is a handy adverb when you're talking about a play. Things that happen offstage might not be visible to the audience, but they're vital to the show: costumers sew on missing buttons offstage, stagehands move parts of the set offstage during scene changes, and actors practice their lines offstage. <i>Offstage</i> works as an adjective or noun as well. You can use it figuratively too, for anything that goes on out of public sight.</p></div></div>`;
