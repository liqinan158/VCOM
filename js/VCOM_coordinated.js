Bridesmaids who can do every line dance in heels are really <i>coordinated</i>. <i>Coordinated</i> means to be unified, or physically able to perform complex moves.</p><p class="long">When you say that someone is coordinated, you mean that they are able to get their muscles to work in sync. Can you pat your head and rub your stomach at the same time? If so, you are coordinated. The word comes from the Latin prefix <i>co-</i> meaning "together" and <i>ordinare</i> meaning "order." When something is coordinated, all the parts operate together in sync as a unit. A coordinated attack comes from many sides all at once.</p></div>`;
