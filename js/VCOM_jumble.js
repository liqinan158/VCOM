For example, many people <i>jumble</i> many random things in a kitchen junk drawer.</p><p class="long">Use the verb <i>jumble</i> to describe what happens when you scramble or mix things up. Some kids, for example, jumble their Lego toys together in a big bin, while others like to sort the pieces by color or size. You can call the mix of items itself a jumble too. In the early 1500s, <i>jumble</i> meant "to move confusedly," and it was probably modeled on <i>stumble</i>. Later that century, it came to mean "mix or confuse."</p></div></div>`;
