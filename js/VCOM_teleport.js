If you’re waiting in line in the freezing cold, you probably wish you could <i>teleport</i> yourself inside to the concert. Unfortunately, we can’t really <i>teleport</i> yet.</p><p class="long">On Star Trek and in other science fiction, people teleport all the time. They are zapped, then they disappear and then reappear somewhere else, like on a different planet. If you could teleport, you wouldn't have to drive a car, fly in a plane, or even walk anywhere: you could simply teleport there. The word is made up of <i>tele</i>, which is Greek for “distance,” and French <i>portare</i> for “carry.”</p></div></div>`;
