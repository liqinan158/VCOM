If you <i>heedlessly</i> ride your skateboard through a huge parade, you'll startle the marching band, and you may spook the horses too.</p><p class="long">If you're reckless, taking unnecessary risks without considering how your action will affect you or others, that's acting heedlessly. This adverb comes from <i>heedless</i>, "showing a reckless lack of care," and its source, <i>heed</i>, "observe" or "care for." You should never dive heedlessly into a pool without first checking to see how deep it is!</p></div>`;
