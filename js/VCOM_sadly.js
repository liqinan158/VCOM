You can speak <i>sadly</i>, hang your head <i>sadly</i>, or even smile <i>sadly</i> to convey how melancholy you're truly feeling.</p><p class="long"><i>Sad</i> means unhappy or sorrowful, so if the adverb <i>sadly</i> describes someone's actions, they're feeling down in the dumps. The Old English root of both words originally meant "full or sated with food," and later came to describe a heaviness that remains in the word <i>sadly</i>. It's also used to mean "unfortunately" or "it is a sad fact that," so you might say, "Sadly, chess club is canceled for the foreseeable future."</p></div></div>`;
