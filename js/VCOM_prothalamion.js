Your beautiful singing voice may get you invited to present a <i>prothalamion</i> at your cousin's wedding.</p><p class="long">You can also call a celebratory marriage song a <i>prothalamium</i>, or one that's written especially for a bride an <i>epithalamium</i>. Whichever word you choose, it's fairly obscure and used in a purely literary context these days. <i>Prothalamion</i> comes from Greek roots: the "before" prefix <i>pro-</i>, and <i>thalamos</i>, "bridal chamber."</p></div>`;
