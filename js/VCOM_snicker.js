var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">snicker</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>snicker</i> is to laugh in a mean or disrespectful way, often expressing superiority. We might <i>snicker</i> at a bully who walks directly into a closed door.</p><p class="long">You can also use this word's near-synonym, <i>snigger</i>, to describe a short snort of a laugh or a scornful sound. You know your stand-up comedy act isn't going well when you don't even get snickers from your audience. A secondary meaning of <i>snicker</i> is horse-related: to whinny. It's actually from this use that the <i>Snickers</i> candy bar gets its name. In 1930, the Mars family named it after their favorite horse â€” Snickers.</p></div>`;
