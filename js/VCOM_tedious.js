You ordinarily wouldn't use <i>tedious</i> for people, just things; you might say "His speeches are tedious," but usually not "He is tedious." Something that is tedious could also be called <i>tiresome</i>. Shakespeare's Friar Laurence says "I will be brief, for my short date of breath / Is not so long as is a tedious tale."</p></div>`;
