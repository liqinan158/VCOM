When <i>hysteria</i> sets in, people are out of control.</p><p class="long">In a medical sense, people who are feeling hysteria may be violent and having trouble perceiving reality. In a more general sense, when someone is <i>hysterical</i>, they're out of control â€” freaking out. Hysteria is the opposite of calmness. It's really a state of emotional chaos that often takes over during natural disasters and scary moments.
