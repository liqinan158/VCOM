A land surveyor might use a GPS or satellite data to situate the boundaries of a particular property. In the 1530's, <i>situate</i> literally meant "to give a site to," from the Medieval Latin <i>situare</i>, "to place or locate," with the Latin root word <i>situs</i>, "place or position."</p></div>`;
