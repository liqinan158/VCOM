var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">quelled</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Anything that's <i>quelled</i> is quieted, extinguished, or calmed. A <i>quelled</i> urge to yell something mean at your brother is an impulse that you've managed to overcome.</p><p class="long">If you're babysitting a child who's afraid of monsters, you might want to check under her bed and in her closet to reassure her that they are monster-free. Her quelled fears will allow her to fall asleep quickly. The adjective <i>quelled</i> comes from <i>quell</i>, "put an end to" or "subdue." The Old English version of this word, <i>cwellan</i>, meant "to kill, murder, or execute." It took on a milder meaning in the fourteenth century.</p></div>`;
