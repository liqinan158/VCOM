Humans are one of the few species that practice <i>monogamy</i>. Well, sometimes.</p><p class="long">You may have heard of something called polygamy, which is having more than one spouse at a time.  The difference between <i>monogamy</i> and its antonym, <i>polygamy</i>, lies in the prefixes.  In Greek, <i>poly</i> means "multiple," while <i>mono</i> means just the opposite:  "single."  Therefore, if you are committed to one romantic partner at a time, you are in a monogamous relationship.</p></div></div>`;
