Please don't try to operate on anyone.</p><p class="long">This adjective is a stylish replacement for terms like "so-called," "self-styled," or "would-be." Your friend who appears loud and outgoing everywhere she goes, but describes herself as shy, is a soi-disant shy person. The word is also used in a legal context when the law disagrees with a person's self description, like the soi-disant ruler of a country who has illegally seized power. In French, <i>soi</i> means "oneself," and <i>disant</i> is "saying."</p></div></div>`;
