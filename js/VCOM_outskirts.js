But if you live in between the two, you are in the <i>outskirts</i>, the place where the city ends and the suburbs begin.</p><p class="long"><i>Outskirts</i> describes the outer edge of a city or town, farthest from the center but still technically part of that place. If you had a city map, you could draw a line on all sides where crowded streets filled with apartment building and businesses begin to give way to single-family houses and country roads. You might not get a perfect circle but you will see that outskirts are those border places between the city and the little towns that surround it.</p></div>`;
