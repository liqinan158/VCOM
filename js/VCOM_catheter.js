It’s the kind of thing you’d get in the hospital.</p><p class="long">The word <i>catheter</i> is from the Greek <i>kathienai</i> which means, "thrust in or let down." That’s what happens when that small tube goes into your body and lets fluid out. If you have surgery in the belly area, you’ll probably need a catheter to drain the urine until you can go to the bathroom by yourself again. A catheter can also be inserted into other organs, like through a blood vessel and into the heart, to see what's going on.</p></div></div>`;
