Not only is Adam polite, he’s also using a <i>palindrome</i>, a word or phrase that can be read the same way either forward or backward.</p><p class="long">"Racecar," "radar," "stats," "eye," "Mom" — these are examples of <i>palindromes</i>, and if you reverse the letters, the words will stay the same.  An entire phrase can be a palindrome, like this: “A man, a plan, a canal: Panama.”  <i>Palindrome</i> comes from a Greek word that means “running back again,” which describes the back and forth nature of palindromes very well.  Here’s a palindrome you can use at parties to impress people: "Satan, oscillate my metallic sonatas."  It really works!</p></div></div>`;
