If you are shopping at the mall on a weekend afternoon and you see an empty parking space, you should make a <i>beeline</i> for it or risk circling the lot for hours.</p><p class="long">The word <i>beeline</i> combines the words <i>bee</i> and <i>line</i>. The idea behind the word is the belief that a bee, when it is done feeding, will take the shortest path back to its hive without delay or meandering. So <i>beeline</i> not only has the sense of being a direct route, but also that there is some haste behind the action. If you make a beeline for the chocolate at a party, you went straight to the dessert table without eating dinner first.</p></div></div>`;
