If your teacher nods <i>thoughtfully</i> when you participate in class, you'll feel she's really listening to you.</p><p class="long">There are various ways to act thoughtfully, including simply thinking â€” like when you gaze thoughtfully at the clear night sky. You're also behaving thoughtfully when you're carefully attentive: "I didn't want to hurt her feelings, so I considered my response thoughtfully after she asked if I liked her haircut." And when you're considerate of others, you also act thoughtfully, like when you thoughtfully buy your brother's favorite candy while you're at the store.</p></div></div>`;
