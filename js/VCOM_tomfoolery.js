Tomfoolery is senseless behavior, like pulling pranks or being obnoxious. If a bunch of students in class keep talking and laughing, the teacher might yell "Stop your tomfoolery!" Tomfoolery can be annoying to others, but it's usually not serious. Committing a crime is a lot worse than tomfoolery. Tomfoolery is more like goofing around or being a clown.</p></div>`;
