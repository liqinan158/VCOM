A <i>rhombus</i> can be a square, or if it has two acute angles and two obtuse angles, it takes the shape of a diamond.</p><p class="long">The <i>rhombus</i> gets its name from the Greek <i>rh√≥mbos</i>, which means "a spinning top." This word describes the shape of a "bullroarer," an object that was tied to a cord and spun around, making a great noise. It was used to taunt bulls into action during bull-fighting events. This rhombus-shaped object has been documented as being used for religious rites and games all over the ancient world. Nowadays, we prefer to study the rhombus in geometry.</p></div></div>`;
