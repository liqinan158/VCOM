Well, it's solitary, somewhat isolated, plain, and disciplined. If you take <i>monastic</i> vows, you promise to live this way.</p><p class="long">Being monastic might sound like a strange or a hard thing to be, but you can compare it to student life very well. Both monks and students spend a lot of time studying books. Monks like quiet, and students need quiet to get work done. Monks live in a community devoted to religion, and students study in a community devoted to learning. The stereotypical party lifestyle of a student isn't very monastic though.</p></div>`;
