Your <i>nouveau-riche</i> neighbor might buy six expensive cars and put lion sculptures in his front yard.</p><p class="long">The term <i>nouveau-riche</i> is a derogatory term meant to mock people who have a lot of money but don't have the good taste to spend it in a "classy" way. The implication is that it's more socially acceptable to inherit money and the long traditions that go with it than to suddenly become wealthy. <i>Nouveau-riche</i>, "new rich" in French, dates from 1813, but the idea goes back to the ancient Greek concept of <i>neo-ploutos</i>.</p></div>`;
