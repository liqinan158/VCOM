A microbiologist might test and compare the <i>motility</i> of various single-celled organisms.</p><p class="long">An easy way to remember that <i>motility</i> means the ability to move without help is the <i>mot-</i> at the root of the word. It's the same root that's found in "motor," which is, of course, the engine that drives a car. If you've got good motility then your motor is working. After a car accident, an athlete's friends are understandably concerned about her motility. Motility is something you tend to take for granted â€” until you sprain an ankle.</p></div>`;
