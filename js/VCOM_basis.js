The <i>basis</i> of a dictionary is that people are curious to learn the meanings of new words.  You are interested, right?</p><p class="long"><i>Basis</i> can also apply to a system or pattern that has been established. For example: Since your job is so exhausting, you need vacations on a regular basis.  The basis of democracy is regular free elections.  Not surprisingly, as its sense of something from which other things spring, <i>basis</i> comes from the Latin word of the same spelling meaning "foundation."</p></div>`;
