They both have <i>keyboards</i>! A computer <i>keyboard</i> has numbers and letters, but a piano <i>keyboard</i> has musical notes. The <i>keyboard</i> is the part that you press with your fingers.</p><p class="long">Besides the rockin’ keyboard of a synthesizer, piano, or organ, there is also the computer keyboard. This keyboard is used for typing, with the earliest examples being the keyboards on typewriters. Occasionally, the word <i>keyboard</i> is used as a verb, meaning "to type on <i>keyboard</i>." It’s also, literally, a board with little hooks to hang the other kind of keys on. The musical instrument meaning came first, around 1819.</p></div></div>`;
