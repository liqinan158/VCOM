When you <i>narrow</i> down your choices, you decrease the number of choices. A road might be too <i>narrow</i> for a car.</p><p class="long">When used to describe something physical such as a street or hips, <i>narrow</i> simply means not wide. Similarly, with quantities it means not much like when you win your basketball game by a narrow margin. But if you use it to describe an attitude, it has the negative meaning of not wide or open enough. If you're narrow-minded, you don't see the big picture –– sometimes it means you think in narrow stereotypes.</p></div>`;
