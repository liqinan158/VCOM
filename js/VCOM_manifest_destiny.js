True story.</p><p class="long">In 1845, white settlers wanted to steal Texas from the natives living there and proclaimed that "Our <i>manifest destiny</i> to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions."  Basically, they believed that Providence (God) granted them the right to take land by force, a course of action they felt was both obvious (<i>manifest</i>) and unavoidable (<i>destiny</i>).  During this dark period of U.S. history, <i>Manifest Destiny</i> was the justification for killing thousands of people.</p></div></div>`;
