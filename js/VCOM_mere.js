If the <i>mere</i> mention of someone's name makes you happy, then just hearing his name — and that alone — is enough to make you smile.</p><p class="long"><i>Mere</i> can have a little irony attached. If you introduce yourself as "a mere student," when you’re announcing your astounding invention, you're contrasting your lowly status with the enormity of your invention. This kind of <i>mere</i> comes from the Latin for "undiluted." <i>Mere</i> has a homograph — a completely different word that's spelled the same — and this <i>mere</i> means a lake or a pond. It’s related to the Dutch word <i>meer</i> — there’s lots of water in Holland.</p></div></div>`;
