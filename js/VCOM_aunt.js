Your uncle is a brother to your mom or dad. Maybe your favorite <i>aunt</i>, Beatrice, sends you a birthday card stuffed with money each year.</p><p class="long">First used around the 13th century, the noun <i>aunt</i> comes from the Latin word <i>amita</i>, meaning "paternal aunt."  The woman who's your aunt is usually older than you are and is also the mother of your cousins. So you may remember your uncle bringing his wife Genevieve — who is also your aunt — and their children Margot and Charlie — your cousins — over for Thanksgiving dinner.</p></div>`;
