When an <i>overture</i> begins, the actors take their places and wait for the curtain to rise.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>overture</i> can also mean "a suggestion or approach designed to get a reaction." Your romantic overture of singing to your girlfriend in the restaurant was met with an embarrassed stare. An overture can also be an event that comes first, like your story about how the after-school program has helped hundreds of kids, an overture to the plea for donations you made next.</p></div>`;
