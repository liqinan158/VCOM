You might <i>equate</i> indulging in a hot fudge sundae with giving up on your body entirely, but I would disagree.</p><p class="long">To <i>equate</i> means to make things equal, and itâ€™s a useful word because this is something people do all the time. They equate strong political views with fascism, they equate having lots of money with good taste, and they equate popularity with goodness. Remember, though, that just because you equate one thing with another does not mean that they really are the same! As you have no doubt noticed, <i>equate</i> has the Latin root <i>equ</i> that means "equal, level," so look there if you need a reminder as to its meaning.</p></div></div>`;
