A great conversationalist will tell you interesting things and probably make you laugh. For a conversationalist, chatting and bantering come easily. A conversationalist is witty and clever, like Dorothy Parker. A bad conversationalist would say inappropriate things, like tell you about an infection just as you’re taking a bite of mashed potatoes.</p></div></div>`;
