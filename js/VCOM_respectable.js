Respectable behavior includes things like contributing to charity, volunteering at an animal shelter, and helping your friends study vocabulary.</p><p class="long">Anything or anyone respectable deserves respect for being honorable or moral. If you return a wallet that you find on the street, that’s respectable behavior. People would probably view you as a respectable person. However, if you removed all the money from the wallet before returning it, that’s not respectable. <i>Respectable</i> can also be used to describe to an adequate or large amount of something. If you return the wallet untouched, you might get a respectable sum as a reward.</p></div>`;
