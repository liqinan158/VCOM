Whether it's the sculpture you made in art class or how you convinced your friend to do your homework — both are considered <i>manipulation</i>.</p><p class="long">From the Latin word for "handful," <i>manipulation</i> certainly has much to do with using your hands to move or shape something, like a good DJ manipulating two totally different tunes into the perfect mashup. But this word also has some negative connotations — a manipulative person knows how to twist words, play on emotions and otherwise manage a situation in a sneaky fashion to get what he wants.</p></div>`;
