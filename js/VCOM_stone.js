If you turn over a large <i>stone</i> in the forest, you might find a whole colony of worms, beetles, and other creepy-crawlies living underneath.</p><p class="long">Stones are commonly used to build walls and buildings. Sculptures are carved from stone, and patios and garden walls are constructed of individual stones. Someone who seems to have "turned to <i>stone</i>" becomes as unmoving and unemotional as a piece of rock. Sometimes a valuable gem is colloquially called a <i>stone</i>, and the hard pit in a plum or apricot is another kind of stone. A stone is also a unit of measuring weight in Britainâ€”equal to 14 pounds.</p></div>`;
