You might be overwhelmed by the magnificence and <i>sublimity</i> of the view you see the first time you visit the Grand Canyon.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>sublimity</i> describes a characteristic that's a little hard to pin down. When something is <i>sublime</i>, it transcends greatness or beauty for the observer â€” like a deeply moving film or a transcendent piece of music. So when something is truly wonderful, or someone acts in a truly noble way, it's an example of sublimity. The Latin root, <i>sublimis</i>, means "uplifted, high, or exalted."</p></div>`;
