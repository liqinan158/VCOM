It’s an almost formal word for what’s leftover. If you’ve gotten over your breakup but you still have the urge to kick your ex, then you have some <i>residual</i> bitterness.</p><p class="long"><i>Residual</i> comes from the Old French root word <i>residu,</i> which means "a remainder." That's why <i>residual</i> can be something that is left behind, like the residual grime on your kitchen counter from wiping it with a dirty sponge or residual feelings of guilt that remain after you dumped your girlfriend because you were rude. A residual is also a payment to a performer, writer, or director of a television show every time the commercial airs; it’s a kind of royalty.</p></div>`;
