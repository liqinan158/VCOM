You would travel the world in a <i>quest</i> for gold. You would not travel to the front of the lunchroom in a <i>quest</i> for tater tots.</p><p class="long">Knights in the Middle Ages were forever taking on <i>quests</i>––most famously to find the Holy Grail. In modern times, you can quest without ever leaving home, thanks to the Internet. A scientist might embark on a quest to find the cure for cancer. A detective might quest for the truth.</p></div>`;
