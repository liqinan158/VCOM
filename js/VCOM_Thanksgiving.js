In the United States, <i>Thanksgiving</i> is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November. In Canada, the celebration occurs on the second Monday in October. The holiday was celebrated regionally throughout early American history until Abraham Lincoln fixed a national date in 1863 in an attempt to create a feeling of national unity during the Civil War.</p></div></div>`;
