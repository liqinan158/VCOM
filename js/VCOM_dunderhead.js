If you manage to start a fire while attempting to fry an egg, your mom might call you a <i>dunderhead</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Dunderhead</i> is a more colorful way to say "dummy" or "stupid." It's derogatory, but not the meanest word for someone making a really foolish move: "You <i>dunderhead</i>!" tends to sound a little bit amused. You might call a goofy kid a dunderhead, or call yourself a dunderhead when you make the same silly mistake over and over again. The origin isn't certain, though the <i>dunder</i> part may come from the Middle Dutch word <i>donder</i>, or "thunder."</p></div></div>`;
