Operated with a crank, this kind of music box plays a little tune until a clown suddenly pops out of an opening in the top. Fun!</p><p class="long">A jack-in-the-box can be a bit terrifying, especially to a very small child who's not expecting to see a scary (or smiling) face emerge abruptly from a colorful music box. The history of this strange toy emphasizes its frightening nature. In France, it's called <i>diable en bo√Æte</i>, or "devil in a box," and is thought to be inspired by a 14th-century English folklore hero who captured the devil in his boot.</p></div>`;
