You might wish you could bring Abraham Lincoln back to life for a day so he could come to tea, but that's impossible. People use the word <i>impossible</i> to mean "out of reach" or "too hard to achieve." A terrible situation can be impossible, and so can a person who refuses to compromise or seems intent on making things difficult for everyone else.</p></div>`;
