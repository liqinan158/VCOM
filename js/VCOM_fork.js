If you aren't skilled at using chopsticks, you can ask the waiter at the Chinese restaurant to bring you a <i>fork</i>.</p><p class="long">In most Western households, forks are a basic part of a table setting â€” unless all you're eating is soup. There are different forks for different purposes, from a long, narrow fondue fork to a large, wide serving fork. There are also garden tools called forks, including pitchforks and hand-held pronged digging implements. Yet another kind of fork is the place where two roads or branches meet in a <i>V</i> shape. If you come to a fork in the road, you better know which direction to take.</p></div></div>`;
