Most plants that don't produce seeds use spores to spread themselves around. Spores are microscopic, and plants like mosses and ferns make huge quantities of spores, which are blown around by the wind so they can grow in new places. <i>Spore</i> comes from the Greek <i>spora</i>, "seed-time" or "a sowing."</p></div>`;
