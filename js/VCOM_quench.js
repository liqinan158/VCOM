If you're stranded in the middle of the desert with nothing to drink, you're probably dreaming of a nice big glass of ice water to <i>quench</i> your thirst.</p><p class="long"><i>Quench</i> originally meant “extinguish fires.” That meaning still works today, but we've expanded it to also apply to quenching the fiery thirst of a summer marathon runner or quenching the hot flames of passion. If you want to get deep about the word <i>quench</i>, consider what Voltaire said: “Superstition sets the whole world in flames; philosophy <i>quenches</i> them.”</p></div></div>`;
