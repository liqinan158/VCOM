The study of heat energy and how it works originally focused on early steam engines, which powered trains in the 19th century. The word itself was coined in the mid-1800s and originally hyphenated, <i>thermo-dynamics</i>, from two Greek roots, <i>therme</i>, "heat," and <i>dynamis</i>, "power" or "energy."</p></div>`;
