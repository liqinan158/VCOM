If you love someone to the <i>exclusion</i> of all others, he or she is the only one for you!</p><p class="long"><i>Exclusion</i> is closely related to some words that have a positive or negative feel. The word <i>exclusive</i> implies something is high-end, desirable, and not for ordinary people. If someone is <i>excluded</i>, on the other hand, it means that someone has been deliberately and painfully left out. <i>Exclusion</i> is more neutral. The department store that advertises a big sale often states at the bottom of the ad that "some exclusions apply," meaning the discounts don't apply to all items.</p></div></div>`;
