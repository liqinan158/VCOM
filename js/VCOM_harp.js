If you want to play an instrument that's portable, you should choose a ukulele instead of a <i>harp</i>.</p><p class="long">Many orchestras include a classical harp, which is such a big instrument that players usually need assistance to move them. Harps are played from a sitting position, resting on the player's shoulder as she plucks the strings with both hands. A folk harp is often smaller, sometimes sitting on a player's lap. When <i>harp</i> is used as a verb, it means to talk constantly and dully about one topic: "The harpist did nothing but <i>harp</i> on about the weather."</p></div>`;
