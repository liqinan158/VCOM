It moves the bags around in a circle.</p><p class="long">You're most likely to see a conveyor belt in a store or an airport. It is a machine built from some material, like rubber, that's stretched across rotating rollers which pull it forward, along with whatever is resting on it. Large post offices use a conveyor belt to move packages, and your food moves along on a conveyor belt at the grocery store checkout. To <i>convey</i> means to move.</p></div></div>`;
