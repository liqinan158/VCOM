That word is reserved for people who collect stamps. If you're going to become a <i>philatelist</i>, start saving those old envelopes.</p><p class="long">The <i>phil-</i> at the beginning of <i>philatelist</i> gives you a hint as to its meaning: it means "love" â€” a Francophile is a person who loves France. The Greek <i>ateleia</i> meant "exemption from payment," an exemption that was marked by a stamp. So a philatelist is literally a person who "loves stamps." The world of the <i>philatelist</i> is a strange and tiny one. It makes one wonder why someone starts collecting stamps in the first place. Maybe it's the pretty little pictures.</p></div>`;
