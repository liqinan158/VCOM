You can also call a <i>barnyard</i> a "farmyard."</p><p class="long">On many farms, animals are moved throughout the day from one area to another â€” in a barn to be milked, or in a pasture to graze on grass, for example. A barnyard gives farmers a place close to farm buildings where animals can be kept safely. In E.B. White's beloved children's book "Charlotte's Web," Wilbur the pig lives out most of his happy life in a barnyard on a small farm.</p></div>`;
