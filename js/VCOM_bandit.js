A bus traveling through an isolated location that's not policed might be at risk for being attacked by bandits. The word <i>bandit</i> comes from the Italian <i>bandito</i>, "outlaw," from the Vulgar Latin <i>bannire</i>, "to proclaim or proscribe," by way of a Germanic root that's shared by <i>ban</i>.</p></div>`;
