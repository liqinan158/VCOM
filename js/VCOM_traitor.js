If you promise a friend you'll keep his secret, but instead you blab it to everyone, you're a <i>traitor.</i></p><p class="long">The word origin says it all: <i>traditorem</i> is the Latin word for "betrayer." Liar? Yes. Backstabber? Yes. True friend? Heavens, no. Traitors betray the trust of those who have faith in them or believe their promises. <i>Traitor</i> also applies to a person who betrays his country by committing treason: turning against his own government, perhaps by selling secret information.</p></div>`;
