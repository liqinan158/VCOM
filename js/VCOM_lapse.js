If you’re normally polite, a <i>lapse</i> in manners could make you forget to say “please” and “thank you.”</p><p class="long">First used to imply a “slip of the memory,” the noun <i>lapse</i> evolved in the sixteenth century from the Latin <i>lapsus</i>, meaning “a slipping and falling, falling into error.” The connotation of “a moral slip” developed later, and the verb form came into existence even later than that. Behaving badly one day when you're usually on your best behavior is a lapse; behaving badly again after a short stint being well-mannered means you're lapsing back into nasty old habits.</p></div>`;
