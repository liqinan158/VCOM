Doing something <i>unassisted</i> means doing it without help.</p><p class="long"><i>Unassisted</i> is an example of a word with two prefixes. The first prefix, <i>un,</i> means the reverse of, and in this case the second prefix, <i>a,</i> means at. The root word <i>sist</i> comes from the Latin word <i>sistere,</i> to stand. So <i>unassisted</i> is another way of saying "without anyone standing by to help."</p></div></div>`;
