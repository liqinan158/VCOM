In other words, she'll try to get them drunk.</p><p class="long">Use the verb <i>inebriate</i> to describe what happens when someone or something intoxicates a person. If you realize that your lemonade is inebriating you, you probably accidentally ordered an alcoholic drink that tastes like lemonade. You can also use <i>inebriate</i> to describe something that's beautiful or thrilling: "There is nothing like watching the sun rise over the mountains to <i>inebriate</i> me." The Latin root, <i>inebriatus</i>, simply means "to make drunk."</p></div>`;
