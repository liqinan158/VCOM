You might bake a batch of <i>buns</i> for a breakfast treat on Sunday mornings.</p><p class="long">Some people celebrate spring or the Easter holidays by making hot cross buns, sweet rolls with currants or raisins and light frosting. Because buns are commonly small and round, the hairstyle that involves a tight coil of hair on the top or back of the head is also called a <i>bun</i>. The origin is probably the French <i>buignete</i>, "a fritter," which had the unpleasant original meaning of "a boil" or "a skin swelling."</p></div></div>`;
