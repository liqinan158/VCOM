In several countries, legislators sometimes engage in <i>obstructionism</i> when they walk very, very slowly to a podium to cast their votes.</p><p class="long">One of the most well-known tools of political obstructionism is the filibuster, which can be employed responsibly but is often used simply to delay or even prevent voting on a controversial bill. When a US Senator filibusters, they extend the debate on a bill by talking for a very long time, a process that's sometimes called "talking a bill to death." <i>Obstructionism</i> comes from <i>obstruction</i>, or "barrier," from the Latin <i>obstruere</i>, "block or hinder."</p></div>`;
