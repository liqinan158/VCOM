If you have a <i>predilection</i> for wool clothing, you should take up knitting.</p><p class="long"><i>Predilection</i> is based on the Latin verb <i>praediligere</i>, or "prefer before others," which breaks down to <i>prae</i>, before, and <i>diligere</i>, "choose or love." We often use the word <i>predilection</i> for tendencies that people seem to have been born with, also called <i>predispositions</i>. If you're a night owl, you probably have a predilection for cities, while morning people tend to prefer the country.</p></div></div>`;
