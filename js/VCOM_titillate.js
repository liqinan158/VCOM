Today's media bombard you with images made to titillate, from video game heroines with extreme physiques to casual nudity on prime-time TV. But it doesn't have to be sex to titillate. A display of fabulous pastries in a bakery window can <i>titillate</i> your senses, or whispered rumors about your high school principal's past life as a rodeo queen may <i>titillate</i> your curiosity.</p></div>`;
