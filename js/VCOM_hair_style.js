When someone asks, "Do you like my new <i>hair style</i>?" it's always kindest to say "yes," no matter what you really think.</p><p class="long">You might keep the same hair style for your entire life, or you could change it monthly — just for kicks. In ancient Rome, noblewomen's hair styles were complicated, with many braids or carefully arranged curls. in the 1960s and 70s, it was common for women to have long, natural hair styles. Men's popular hair styles have changed nearly as much over the years, ranging from short bangs to long curls, to elaborate wigs covering their heads.</p></div></div>`;
