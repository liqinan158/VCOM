Time to take Mittens to get her claws trimmed.</p><p class="long">Most of our words are rooted in Greek, Latin, or German, so it's refreshing to see a word that arose in a whole different language: <i>amok's</i> origins are in the Malay language of Indonesia.  In the 1500s, a Portuguese writer and explorer named Duarte Barbosa described a murderous tribe on the island of Java as the "Amuco," and the word passed on into English.  <i>Amuco</i> came from  <i>Amuk</i>, a Malay word meaning "attacking furiously."</p></div></div>`;
