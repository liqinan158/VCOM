You might see a prestidigitator at a party or on a street corner, pulling quarters out of people's ears and turning rabbits into bouquets of flowers. The noun <i>prestidigitation</i> is another name for the quick hand movements and secret techniques of an illusionist. Both words come from the Latin word for "juggler," <i>pr√¶stigiator</i>.</p></div>`;
