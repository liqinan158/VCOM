A <i>sparkler</i> burns very slowly, giving you time to wave it around and make patterns in the dark before its flame goes out.</p><p class="long">Most sparklers are thin pieces of flexible metal that are partly coated with chemicals that burn and sparkle. Though sparklers are often thought of as a fireworks for kids, they burn at a very high temperature and can cause serious burns if they're not used carefully. Sparklers are particularly beautiful when they're lit outside in the dark. While the sparkler's invention is a bit of a mystery, the word <i>sparkler</i> came into use around 1879, from the verb <i>sparkle</i>.</p></div>`;
