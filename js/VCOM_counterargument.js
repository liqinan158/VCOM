In criminal court, a defense attorney usually gives a <i>counterargument</i> to the prosecutor's accusations.</p><p class="long">A <i>counterargument</i> is really just what it sounds like â€” an argument that runs counter to someone else's original argument. In this case, <i>counter</i> means "against" or "in response to," from the Latin root <i>contra</i>, "opposite, against, or in return." A true counterargument is well thought out, countering each idea with a set of reasons proving that the opposite is true.</p></div>`;
