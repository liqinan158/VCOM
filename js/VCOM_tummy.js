This word is mainly used for talking to little kids: "Aw, do you have a <i>tummy</i> ache?"</p><p class="long">You wouldn't use the word tummy in your human anatomy class, but you might use it when you babysit your two-year-old niece. Infants sometimes have "tummy time," a short period when they are turned onto their stomachs so they can develop their neck and shoulder muscles. <i>Tummy</i> has been in use since the 19th century, and experts guess that it comes from a childish pronunciation of <i>stomach</i>.</p></div>`;
