Most people play a <i>piano</i> with their fingers, but Jerry Lee Lewis played with his fingers, feet, elbows, and, ahem, backside.</p><p class="long">A piano makes a sound when each key moves a small hammer that strikes a metal string. The inside of a piano looks kind of like a harp. Pianos are vital in many kinds of music, from classical to pop, and in the case of Lewis, boogie-woogie. <i>Piano</i> comes from the original Italian name for the instrument: <i>piano e forte</i>, "soft and loud." <i>Piano</i>  is also the musical notation that tells the player that something should be played quietly.</p></div></div>`;
