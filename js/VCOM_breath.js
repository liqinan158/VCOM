It’s also the air you inhale and exhale, or a slight movement of air, like a breeze.</p><p class="long"><i>Breath</i> comes from the Old English <i>braeth</i> (“scent" or "smell”). Many figures of speech originate with the idea that breathing deeply energizes or calms us. You can "catch your breath" by slowing down, and you might "take a breath" by taking a break or walking away from a stressful situation. A "breath of fresh air" might be just that, or, metaphorically, it might signal the arrival of something new and different that invigorates us or refocuses our attention.</p></div>`;
