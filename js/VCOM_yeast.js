The <i>yeast</i> interacts with sugar and fills the bread with pockets of air as it bakes.</p><p class="long">When you buy yeast for baking cinnamon rolls or rye bread at home, it comes in a small packet and looks like little brownish grains. The first step in using yeast is often mixing it with warm water and a little sugar. When yeast is active, or alive, the mixture quickly becomes bubbly and foamy. Yeast is also used in brewing beer and wine. The word <i>yeast</i> comes from a Germanic root â€” the German word <i>Gischt</i>, or "froth," is closely related.</p></div>`;
