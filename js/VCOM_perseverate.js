It's almost as if someone who perseverates gets stuck on a word or gesture and can't stop repeating it. <i>Perseverate</i> contains the word "persevere," to continue determinedly, and <i>perseverare</i>, the Latin root, means "to persist." When you persist with clear intentions, you persevere, but when those intentions are lost and only the persistence remains, you perseverate.</p></div></div>`;
