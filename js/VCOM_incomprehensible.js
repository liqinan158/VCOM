Could be you're a genius! Could be you're just not very good at poetry.</p><p class="long"><i>Incomprehensible</i> originates from the Latin <i>incomprehensibilis:</i> <i>in-</i> ("not") and <i>comprehensibilis</i> ("perceptible, evident, intelligible"). Many unfamiliar customs or rituals seem incomprehensible from a distance, for example, the early Chinese practice of foot binding, in which girls tightly bandaged their feet to prevent them from getting bigger. Similarly, future generations may find today's Western high-heeled shoes incomprehensible, leading them to ask, "What in the world were they thinking?!"</p></div></div>`;
