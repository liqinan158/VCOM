If you've looked through a water droplet on a car windshield, you've seen water <i>refract</i> light.</p><p class="long">You're most likely to come across the verb <i>refract</i> when you're studying physics and the properties of light waves. We come across examples of this everyday, though — when you study a straw in a glass of water, you see the water refract light in a way that makes the straw look bent or jagged. A rainbow also happens when raindrops refract light, breaking it into its component colors. In Latin, <i>refract</i> means "broken up."</p></div>`;
