A lot of lapidary work involves making jewelry, but doing inscriptions in monuments is also lapidary. Someone who collects precious or rare stones has a lapidary hobby. You can also call a person who works with such stones a lapidary. <i>Lapidary</i> comes from the Latin word, <i>lapis</i>, for stone.</p></div>`;
