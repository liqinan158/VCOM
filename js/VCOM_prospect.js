After you graduate top of your class at Harvard, for example, your job <i>prospects</i> look great.</p><p class="long"><i>Prospect</i> is from the Latin word <i> prospectus</i>  which means a "view or outlook." A <i>prospect</i> is still a way of looking ahead and expecting good things. It's like <i>potential</i> in that it's something that might be but isn't yet. There is also the <i>potential</i> for something bad to happen, but <i>prospects</i> usually look good. In the 1800s, when men in floppy brown hats started saying "There's gold in them there hills!" the noun became a verb â€” to <i>prospect</i> is to search for gold. Either way, when you have <i>prospects</i>, you have a golden future.</p></div>`;
