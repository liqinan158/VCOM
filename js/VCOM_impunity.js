Students are not allowed to chew gum in school, but teachers do it with <i>impunity</i>. Not fair!</p><p class="long">The noun, <i>impunity,</i> comes from the Latin roots <i>im-</i> ("not") plus <i>poena</i> ("punishment"), a root which has also produced the word <i>pain</i>. Impunity, then, is the freedom from punishment or pain. If someone has committed a punishable offense but does not have to fear punishment, he or she does it "with impunity." Cybercriminals operate with impunity in some countries.</p></div></div>`;
