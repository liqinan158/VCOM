A <i>functioning</i> refrigerator keeps your food cold. A <i>functioning</i> television shows a clear picture. A <i>functioning</i> group gets things done in an orderly and timely fashion.</p><p class="long">A <i>function</i> is the purpose that something is made for. A flashlight's function is to light up.  But if it's not functioning, or working properly, you might need to change its batteries or buy a new one. If your car can get you from point A to point B but the engine sounds like it's going to die any minute, you might say that it is "barely <i>functioning.</i>" Sometimes people use the word <i>functional</i> to mean the thing as functioning.</p></div></div>`;
