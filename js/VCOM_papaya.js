A <i>papaya</i> and banana smoothie makes a delicious and healthy breakfast.</p><p class="long">Most people eat papayas raw when the fruit is soft and ripe, although some find the smell of a perfectly ripe papaya to be terrible.

Papayas are also called <i>pawpaws</i>, which gets a bit confusing since there's a totally different North American fruit also called a pawpaw.</p></div>`;
