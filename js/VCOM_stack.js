You can also use <i>stack</i> as a verb meaning "to arrange in piles."</p><p class="long">If you stack the dollar bills you earned from your lemonade stand, you'll eventually have a stack of dollar bills. Unlike the similar word <i>pile</i>, <i>stack</i> implies a neat, orderly bundle, rather than a messy, haphazard one. When someone "stacks the deck," they cheat in order to achieve the outcome they wantâ€”sometimes literally, by arranging a deck of cards unfairly.</p></div></div>`;
