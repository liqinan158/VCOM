The people who founded the United States first came to America to live as part of a British <i>colony</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Colony</i> comes from the Latin <i>colonia</i>, meaning "settled land, farm." <i>Colony</i> can also mean "a group of people who've gathered to live near each other and share the same interest." An artists' colony would be a place where everyone's an artist, while a Dunkin' Donuts colony would be full of coffee lovers. The same rules apply to the animal kingdom â€” an ant colony has a shared interest in ruining your picnic.</p></div>`;
