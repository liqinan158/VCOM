Your cat might <i>prowl</i> around the room and pounce on your feet, which is cute if you're awake, but annoying when you're asleep.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>prowl</i> means the act of moving as if to capture prey. You could take a prowl through the music shop and try to find your favorite vintage album. <i>Prowl</i> is also used in the phrase "on the <i>prowl</i>," which implies that the person doing the prowling is looking for a romantic partner. Your idea of a fun Saturday night might be staying home while your friends go on the prowl at the dance club.</p></div>`;
