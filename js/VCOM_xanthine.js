You're most likely to see it used to suggest a yellow tint, as in fall trees turned a <i>xanthine</i> orange.</p><p class="long">Biochemists will tell you that <i>xanthine</i> is actually the name of a chemical compound found in blood and urine. Coffee drinkers might wish it weren't so, but xanthine is also a close cousin to caffeine, making pee and your morning latte a little too chemically close for comfort. But never fear. <i>Xanthine's</i> connection to the color yellow comes from its older, Greek derivation, not from its connection to pee. So calling something xanthine is not exactly the same as calling something pee-colored.</p></div>`;
