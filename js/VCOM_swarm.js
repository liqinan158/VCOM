var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">swarm</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>swarm</i> is a good word for a large group of bees going on the attack — not good news. Like bees, any group of people or animals can be considered a <i>swarm</i> if they act together and quickly — even fiercely.</p><p class="long">On a hot day, when an ice-cream truck shows up, it's usually greeted by a swarm of hot, hungry kids. People at a concert can be a swarm — and people in the swarm can be hurt, because there's lots of pushing and shoving. When tickets for a popular movie go on sale, a swarm of people will swarm the theater. As you can see, <i>swarm</i> works as either a noun or verb, and people could teach bees a thing or two about swarming.</p></div>`;
