Your family might host a <i>barbecue</i> every summer to celebrate the end of the school year.</p><p class="long">If you're invited to a barbecue, you'll probably be served meat that's been slowly cooked or smoked over a fire, served with sweet and spicy barbecue sauce. Sometimes this kind of food itself is called <i>barbecue</i>, and the oven or grill that's used is also a <i>barbecue</i>. This word dates from the 17th century, from the Spanish <i>barbacoa</i>, which probably stems from the Arawakan <i>barbakoa</i>, "framework of sticks" used to cure meat.</p></div></div>`;
