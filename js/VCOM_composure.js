Keeping your <i>composure</i> for a skinned knee? Easy. Keeping your <i>composure</i> during an avalanche? Not so easy.</p><p class="long">The word <i>composure</i> is from the related word <i>composed</i>, but don't think of the word in the musical sense. In this case, <i>composed</i> means calm. What's the difference between the two? Well, <i>composed</i> is an adjective, so you simply are <i>composed</i>. <i>Composure</i>, on the other hand, is a noun, so you can lose, keep, regain, or maintain your composure â€” your ability to stay calm. If you lose your composure, you're freaking out.</p></div></div>`;
