You might have an <i>open house</i> to welcome your new next door neighbors.</p><p class="long">As opposed to a formal party that starts at a certain time and has a specific guest list, an open house is a casual celebration. You can also use this term for the event a realtor arranges at a home that's for sale, a day when it's open for touring to prospective buyers. Before it became the name of a kind of party, <i>open house</i> was used as a noun phrase meaning "hospitality for all visitors."</p></div>`;
