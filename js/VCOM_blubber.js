Inuits and other northern people have traditionally relied on eating <i>blubber</i>.</p><p class="long">Based on marine animal blubber, some people describe human fat as <i>blubber</i> too â€” often in a derogatory way. When <i>blubber</i> is a verb, it means to sob uncontrollably: "The little girl sat down and started to <i>blubber</i> after skinning her knee." <i>Blubber</i> was originally spelled <i>blober</i>, meaning "a bubble" or "bubbling water," which led to the "crying" meaning of the word. In the 15th century, it also meant "jellyfish" and "whale oil."</p></div>`;
