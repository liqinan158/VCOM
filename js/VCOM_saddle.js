If you buy an expensive <i>saddle</i> for example. you may be <i>saddled</i> (or burdened) with debt.</p><p class="long">A saddle makes a horse's rider more comfortable and secure â€” and if you ever ride a camel, you'll also sit on a saddle. As a verb, to <i>saddle</i> means "to put a saddle on an animal," although it also has the figurative meaning of "to burden." Your excessive spending might saddle you with debt, or your position as the oldest of eight siblings could saddle you with too much responsibility.</p></div>`;
