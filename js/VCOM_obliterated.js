If your dreams of becoming a trapeze artist are completely <i>obliterated</i> after your first two difficult weeks at circus school, maybe you can switch to clowning.</p><p class="long"><i>Obliterated</i> comes from the Latin phrase <i>literas scribere</i>, meaning strike or cross out letters. When something is obliterated, it disappears or is so damaged, you can barely recognize it. It might be literally wiped out, like a house obliterated by fire, or figuratively destroyed, like your obliterated hopes of marrying your favorite movie star someday.</p></div></div>`;
