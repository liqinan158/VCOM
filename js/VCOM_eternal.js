The Latin root of <i>eternal</i> is <i>aeternalis</i>, translating roughly as “of great age,” and  eternal things are really, really old.  <i>Eternal</i> can describe an abstract idea that never changes, like the eternal truths of war, or it can describe an annoyance that you wish would end, like the eternal boredom you feel watching a really dull movie.</p></div></div>`;
