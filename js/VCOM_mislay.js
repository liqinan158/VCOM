If your grandmother mislays her hearing aid, you'll have to shout and gesture until she finds it again. <i>Mislay</i> implies that you've put the lost object down somewhere, and you'll find it again soon. The word adds the "bad" or "wrong" prefix <i>mis-</i> to <i>lay</i>, from the Old English <i>lecgan</i>, "to place on the ground."</p></div>`;
