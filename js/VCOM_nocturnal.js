That includes vampires, owls that like to hunt by moonlight, and that roommate who stays up playing video games until the wee hours of the morning.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>nocturnal</i> comes from the Late Latin <i>nocturnalis</i>, which means “belonging to the night." You've probably heard of nocturnal animals, like bats and fireflies, who sleep during the day and come out to play when the sun goes down. The opposite of <i>nocturnal</i> is <i>diurnal</i>, meaning active during the daytime — but you probably won't be using that word much unless you're a zoologist.</p></div>`;
