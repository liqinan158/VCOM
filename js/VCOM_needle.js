When a tailor sews a button on your shirt or even when a doctor sews your skin back together, a <i>needle</i> is used.</p><p class="long">Needles are sharp — when you stitch fabric with a needle, you might use a metal thimble to protect your fingertip. When a doctor or nurse uses a needle, it needs to be very sharp — it has to be able to penetrate human skin to stitch up a wound or inject a medication. When you <i>needle</i> someone, you don't literally poke them, but you do annoy or provoke them in some way.</p></div></div>`;
