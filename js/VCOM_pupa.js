A butterfly or moth <i>pupa</i> is known as a "chrysalis."</p><p class="long">Some kinds of insects go through dramatic, distinct stages as they grow, otherwise known as <i>metamorphosis</i>. For these insects, the egg and larval stages are followed by a period of time as a pupa that can last weeks, or even years, depending on the insect species and what the temperature is. At the end of their time as a pupa, insects break open their shell or case and emerge, fully grown.</p></div></div>`;
