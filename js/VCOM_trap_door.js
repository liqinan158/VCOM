In mystery novels and movies, <i>trap doors</i> often lead to secret passageways.</p><p class="long">You can also call a trap door a <i>hatch</i>, and both terms can be used to describe a hinged or sliding doorway in either a floor or a ceiling, like the trap door you pull open in order to get into an attic. A trap door might also lead to a crawl space or a bomb shelter beneath a house. The earliest use of <i>trap door</i> was recorded in the fourteenth century.</p></div></div>`;
