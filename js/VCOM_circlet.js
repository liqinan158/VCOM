You could talk about a bride putting a circlet of gold on her groom's finger, or describe a doughnut as a circlet of sweet dough fried in hot oil. Classically, a circlet referred to a crown â€” a circle made of fine metal and jewels. The Latin root, <i>circus</i>, means "ring," and the French <i>cerclet</i> came later, to mean a smaller ring or circle.</p></div></div>`;
