Like letting your Great Aunt Edna pinch your cheeks or passing gym to get your diploma. <i>Mandatory</i> is often used in opposition to <i>optional</i>. If you want to compete with the swim team at school, weeknight practices are <i>mandatory</i>, meaning you have to go, though the Saturday dawn swim practice remains optional, meaning it's up to you.</p></div></div>`;
