When you put something in a jar, you <i>jar</i> it. Another way to use the verb version of <i>jar</i> is to mean "shock painfully or unpleasantly:" "Every bump we drove over in the old Jeep would <i>jar</i> my whole body." The <i>jar</i> that's a container probably stems from the Middle French <i>jarre</i>, "liquid measure."</p></div>`;
