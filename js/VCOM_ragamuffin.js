In essence, you are calling her a shabbily clad street urchin.</p><p class="long">Now a generally playful and affectionate term indicating dishevelment, <i>ragamuffin</i> came into existence in the mid-14th century with a more punishing connotation. Derived in part from the word <i>ragged</i>, then used to refer to the devil’s shaggy appearance, it has also historically been used to describe a lazy and worthless, or beggarly individual. Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable provides a helpful and quirky explanation for the word: “A muffin is a poor thing of a creature, a 'regular muff'; so that a <i>ragamuffin</i> is a sorry creature in rags.”</p></div></div>`;
