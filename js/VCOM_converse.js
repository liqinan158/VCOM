You could <i>converse</i> with your best friend for hours over lunch, but continue the chit-chat through the afternoon matinee and you might get shushed.</p><p class="long">Oddly enough, <i>converse</i> was originally a verb meaning “to move about, live or dwell” when it first came into existence in the mid 14th century. But today we only use <i>converse</i> to talk about, well, talking. Quipped the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, “When marrying, one should ask oneself this question: Do you believe that you will be able to <i>converse</i> well with this woman into your old age?” A good question for marrying men and women!</p></div>`;
