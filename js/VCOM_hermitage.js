If you want to sound fancy, it could be called a <i>hermitage</i>, a dwelling removed from civilization.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>hermitage</i> has origins in the French word <i>hermite</i>, meaning “hermit,” a person who lives alone, far from society. <i>Hermitage</i> can describe the place where a hermit lives, or a dwelling occupied by an isolated religious group that prefers solitude. But the word is likely to be used more broadly to describe a secluded or remote dwelling, a place of solitude, where you won’t run into a neighbor while mowing the lawn in the backyard.</p></div>`;
