Most real people avoid <i>precipices</i>.</p><p class="long">Unless you're a skilled climber or mountain-sport enthusiast, a precipice is a scary thing. Some imagine falling off and making the sharp drop, while others get dizzy just thinking about looking down. This makes sense, considering that the 17th-century English word <i>precipice</i> comes, through French, from Latin words meaning "headlong" and "abrupt descent." In modern use, <i>precipice</i> also describes how it feels to fall, or fail, in areas of life that don't involve mountains, such as being "on the precipice of losing everything."</p></div></div>`;
