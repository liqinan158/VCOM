Being alone doesn’t have to be a bummer, and sometimes <i>lonely</i> simply means preferring to be by yourself, like the lonely poet who takes long walks in the woods.  Mars is a lonely planet because no life can survive there, and on a cross country trip you’ll drive down many long and lonely roads.</p></div>`;
