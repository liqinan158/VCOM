A <i>travesty</i> can be more than that, though. A <i>travesty</i> of justice, for example, is a court case that makes a mockery of the system, or so you might think if the verdict isn't in your favor. There are lots of examples in literature: the book <i>Don Quixote</i> is a <i>travesty</i> of Medieval Romance.</p></div>`;
