It looks like a cow licked your hair in one spot.</p><p class="long">A cowlick can drive you crazy because it can’t be tamed! You can comb and comb a cowlick, but it just won’t stay down. A cowlick can show up anywhere on your head, like a little sprig shooting up from the back or a lonely wave in the front. Since most cowlicks are reoccurring, it’s best just to go with it. When a mama cow licks her baby, her tongue makes a little swirl in the fur, hence the name <i>cowlick</i>.</p></div>`;
