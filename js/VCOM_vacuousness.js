You get a kick out of reality TV shows, but your intellectual sister scoffs at their <i>vacuousness</i>.</p><p class="long">Things that demonstrate empty-headedness or a lack of deep thought are <i>vacuous</i>, and the state of being vacuous is <i>vacuousness</i>. You can use this word to express the superficiality of things (or people), like the vacuousness of middle school gossip or the vacuousness of a politician's empty words. The Latin root, <i>vacuus</i>, means "empty, void, or free."</p></div>`;
