That is because of the <i>uniformity</i>, or consistency, of the curriculum.</p><p class="long">Think about the word <i>uniform</i>. When you see police officers or students in uniform, it makes them all kind of look the same. If things don't change, you can say there is uniformity. Uniformity can be a good or a bad thing. A uniformity in TV shows would be boring. On the other hand, you would like to see uniformity among the standards of medical schools, so you know all doctors are qualified.</p></div></div>`;
