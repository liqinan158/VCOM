At the beach, you can use a <i>pail</i> to carry water and sand, and also to mold the towers of your sandcastle.</p><p class="long">You can also call a pail a <i>bucket</i> â€” although <i>pail</i> implies a smaller container, exactly the sort a child would use, along with a small shovel, when playing in a sandbox. You might also use a pail to catch drips from a leaky ceiling, or pour a small amount of paint into a pail when you're touching up the trim in your bedroom. This word comes from the Old French <i>paelle</i>, "cooking or frying pan."</p></div></div>`;
