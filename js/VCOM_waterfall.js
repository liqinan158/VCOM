If you like to go canoeing down the river, make sure you stop before you get to that <i>waterfall</i>!</p><p class="long">The word <i>waterfall</i> comes from its Old English precursor, <i>wætergefeall</i>. It's a beautifully simple description of exactly what a waterfall is — water that falls continuously from a height, either in a river's course or over the edge of an iceberg. Waterfalls are most common in steep mountain rivers, but there are many smaller waterfalls as well. The world's tallest waterfall, Angel Falls in Venezuela, is over 3,000 feet high.</p></div></div>`;
