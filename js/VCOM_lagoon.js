Much of the show’s action took place at the lagoon, where the lovable castaways spent their time hanging around and planning how to be rescued. A <i>lagoon</i> is a good place for castaways to congregate because it’s shallow and separated from the ocean by a natural barrier, which means it’s protected from the rough waters of the ocean and offers easier access for swimming and fishing. If you’re ever stranded on a deserted island, you too would probably choose to spend your time at the lagoon, staring into the distance and watching for approaching ships.</p></div></div>`;
