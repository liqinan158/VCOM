You might talk about the <i>imminence</i> of snow on a cold, cloudy winter morning.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>imminence</i> is good for describing the quality of something that's likely to happen soon. It comes from the adjective <i>imminent</i>, or "about to happen." A small country might worry about the imminence of invasion from a larger country, or you could predict the imminence of your dog running to bark at the door after hearing him growl at a noise outside. The Latin root word is <i>imminere</i>, "to overhang, impend, or be near."</p></div></div>`;
