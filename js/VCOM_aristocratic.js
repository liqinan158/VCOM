An aristocratic person usually gains this social status through birthright rather than demonstrated merit. <i>Aristocratic</i> can describe someone or something belonging to this group, like an aristocratic estate or an aristocratic leader, but it can also describe something grand and elegant. You might have an aristocratic expression on your face as you attend a formal party.</p></div></div>`;
