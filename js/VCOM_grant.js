When you grant something you are letting someone have or do something that they are asking for.</p><p class="long">When you <i>grant</i> something, you’re typically fulfilling a request that is not an automatic entitlement.  For example, if you order a plate of spaghetti with tomato sauce in a restaurant, when the meal arrives, you wouldn’t say that the chef has been kind enough to <i>grant</i> you the meal; it’s an order that’s been fulfilled. If you ask the chef to make it a vegan dish that doesn’t include chicken stock, however, then you’re making a request that it’s up to the chef to <i>grant</i> — or not.</p></div></div>`;
