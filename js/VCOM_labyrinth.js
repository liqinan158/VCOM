In figurative use, a <i>labyrinth</i> is a complicated situation: our tax code is a <i>labyrinth</i> of rules and regulations.</p><p class="long">In Greek mythology, the <i>Labyrinth</i> was the structure built for King Minos of Crete to confine the Minotaur, a monster with the head of a bull and the body of a man. The word <i>maze</i> is a near synonym for <i>labyrinth</i>, and is also used figuratively, as in, "After war broke out, trying to figure out how to get a visa to leave the country was like navigating a <i>maze</i>, a veritable <i>labyrinth</i> of wrong turns and false hope."</p></div>`;
