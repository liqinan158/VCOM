It can mean a kind of slang, a technical language or a code. In high school, only those who spend their time studying computer manuals could understand the <i>argot</i> of the computer lab kids.</p><p class="long">The word <i>argot</i> was originally used to describe the slang of thieves and rogues, who spoke in sneaky ways that the upright citizen couldnâ€™t understand. We can also use <i>argot</i> to describe less criminal kinds of vocabularies. Any specialized practice can create an argot: boxers talk of bodyshots and jabs, just as grammar teachers complain of split infinitives and dangling participles.</p></div></div>`;
