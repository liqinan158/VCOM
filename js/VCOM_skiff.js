If you decide to purchase a <i>skiff</i> instead of giant yacht, you're probably someone who prefers the quiet, simple life. (Or maybe you just didnâ€™t want to spend the money on a yacht.)</p><p class="long">A skiff may be powered by oars, sails, or a motor, but in any of these cases, a typical skiff can carry only a few passengers. <i>Skiff</i> originally referred to a small boat attached to a large ship; the skiff would have been used for communication with and transportation to other large ships and the shore. Winslow Homer, a 19th-century American artist, often portrayed skiffs in his depictions of marine scenes.</p></div></div>`;
