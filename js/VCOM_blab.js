You might accidentally <i>blab</i> to your dad about your brother getting in trouble at school.</p><p class="long">A reporter could take you by surprise and get you to blab about your movie star neighbor, and it might be hard for a little kid not to blab about the birthday gift he's giving his sister. Another way to blab is simply to talk a lot: "I sat there and listened to him <i>blab</i> about all the famous people he knows." <i>Blab</i> comes from the Middle English <i>blabbe</i>, "one who does not control his tongue."</p></div></div>`;
