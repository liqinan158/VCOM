If your birthday is in October, an <i>opal</i> is your birthstone.</p><p class="long">An opal is a mineral made of silica, and it's found within the cracks and notches of many different kinds of rock. Most of the world's supply of opals comes from Australia. A polished opal that's been set in a ring or necklace is usually several shades or colors — most often blues and greens — with sparkles or shimmers decorating the stone. The word <i>opal</i> comes from the Latin <i>opalus</i>, and its ultimate root is probably the Sanskrit <i>upala</i>, "precious stone."</p></div>`;
