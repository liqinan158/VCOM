A rabble-rouser's highest priority is getting people worked up, especially by appealing to their prejudices and ignorance, with the ultimate goal of his own political support. It's a nineteenth century phrase that combines <i>rouse</i>, or "stir up," with <i>rabble</i>, which originally meant "a pack of animals," and later came to also mean "an unruly mob of people."</p></div>`;
