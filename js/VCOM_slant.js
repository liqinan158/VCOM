Many streets in San Francisco are so steep that they <i>slant</i> dramatically upward.</p><p class="long">You can slant the brim of your hat down to keep the sun out of your eyes, and the sun itself can slant at a lower angle (or <i>slant</i>), forcing you to put on your dark sunglasses. There's also the <i>slant</i> that means "show bias," the way a newspaper reporter does when she slants a story in favor of one political party over another. <i>Slant</i> was originally <i>slenten</i>, "slip sideways," from a Germanic root.</p></div>`;
