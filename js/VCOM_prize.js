When you win first <i>prize</i> in your state spelling bee, you might get a medal and a trip to the national competition in Washington, DC.</p><p class="long">Many prizes are given for hard work, athletic skill, or superior intellect, but it's also possible to win a prize from sheer good luck. The prize for a winning lottery ticket, for example, might be a million dollars. If your dog comes in first at an obedience competition, you can call her your "<i>prize</i> pup." And if you adore and value that dog more than anything else, you can say you <i>prize</i> her.</p></div></div>`;
