You can also call a <i>nickelodeon</i> a "jukebox."</p><p class="long">In the US, it's common to refer to an old-timey jukebox or player piano (or any music machine that operates with a coin or token) as a <i>nickelodeon</i>, although the original meaning was a movie theater or cinema that cost five cents. The movie theater definition dates from the late 1800s, from the Greek <i>oideion</i>, "building for performances," and the jukebox meaning was first used in the 1930s.</p></div>`;
