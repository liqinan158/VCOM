The hardest part of your trip to rural China might be graciously accepting and attempting to chew the <i>gristly</i> meat your hosts offer you.</p><p class="long">The Old English word that spawned <i>gristly</i> is <i>gristle</i>, literally meaning "cartilage." When meat in particular is hard to chew, it's gristly. This adjective sounds like <i>grisly</i> (no <i>t</i>), which describes something that is horrifying. Although it can also be horrifying, save <i>gristly</i> to describe that chewy mystery meat you try and choke down to be polite.</p></div>`;
