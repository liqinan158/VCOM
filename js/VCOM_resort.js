You tried everything to figure out your math homework on your own, so asking your dad for help was your last <i>resort.</i></p><p class="long"><i>Resort</i>, pronounced "re-ZORT," is also a verb that means "to adopt a course of action to improve your situation." It's when you use that last resort: if you can't convince your mom to let you go rock-climbing, you will resort to begging. <i>Resort</i> also means a fancy hotel, usually in a very scenic location, or a place you go often â€” when your friends didn't know where you were, they checked your resorts: the gym and the park.</p></div>`;
