The late comedian Groucho Marx famously said, "I refuse to join any club that would have me as a <i>member</i>." Go figure.</p><p class="long">When an object, like a plant or an element, is a member, it's also part of a group or class. A tiger, for example, is a member of the genus called Panthera, and it's also a member of the cat family. You're a member of the human species, and if you swim competitively, you're also a member of a swim team. The United States is a member, along with 192 other countries, of the United Nations. The Latin root of <i>member</i> is <i>membrum</i>, "part," and also "limb or part of the body."</p></div>`;
