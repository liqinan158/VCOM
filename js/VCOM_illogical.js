But slap the prefix <i>il-</i> in front of it, and suddenly the word reverses its meaning. Illogical? Check out other words with the same prefix, like <i>illegitimate</i> and <i>illegal,</i> and you'll quickly see that the prefix<i>il-</i> in front of a word starting in "l" means "not." Suddenly the meaning of <i>illogical</i> isn't quite so illogical after all, is it?</p></div></div>`;
