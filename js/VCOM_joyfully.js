If you're in a bad mood, watching your little sister and her friends run around the playground <i>joyfully</i> might cheer you up.</p><p class="long">If you love snow, you'll joyfully welcome those first white flakes, and if singing with your friends makes you deliriously happy, you'll joyfully join in when they begin to croon. Your dog might like to frolic in the park joyfully, and your parents might applaud joyfully when you receive your high school diploma. <i>Joyfully</i> comes from <i>joy</i> and its root, which means "I rejoice."</p></div></div>`;
