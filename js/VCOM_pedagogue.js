The word comes from the Greek <i>pedo</i> for "child" and <i>agogos</i> for "leader." A <i>pedagogue</i> leads people by teaching.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>pedagogue</i>, pronounced "PED-uh-gog," originally referred to "a slave who brings boys to school." Although the similar word <i>pedagogy</i> is the art of teaching, <i>pedagogue</i> has negative connotations. To call a teacher a pedagogue implies that he or she is "the teacher that time forgot," possibly using notes and handouts from twenty years ago, standing in that same spot, year after year, saying the same things, as students stare out the same windows.</p></div></div>`;
