You can also use the word to refer to a specific situation in the game of golf: if you make a terrible shot, a <i>mulligan</i> is when you're allowed to try again. The stew came first, around 1905, and the golf stroke followed in the 1940s, possibly from the name of a specific Canadian golfer.</p></div></div>`;
