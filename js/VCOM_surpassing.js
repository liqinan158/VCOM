A scene of <i>surpassing</i> hilarity in a movie might make you laugh until tears run down your face.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>surpassing</i> is a bit old fashioned, and you're most likely to read it in a novel or poem. Its most common use is in the phrase "<i>surpassing</i> beauty," or exceptional beauty. A poet might reflect on the surpassing beauty of the sunset over the ocean, for example. To <i>surpass</i> is to "go beyond," from the prefix <i>sur-</i>, "beyond," and the Old French verb <i>passer</i>, "to go by."</p></div></div>`;
