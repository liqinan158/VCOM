Some people enjoy your <i>inherently</i> cheerful nature, but it drives other people crazy because they find you annoyingly perky.</p><p class="long"><i>Inherently</i> is the adverbial form of the adjective <i>inherent</i>. They both come from the Latin word <i>inhaerere</i>, meaning "adhere to," with the root <i>haerere</i> meaning "to stick." Synonyms for <i>inherently</i> include <i>intrinsically</i> and <i>essentially</i>. If you do something inherently, it is so well ingrained in you that it's become part of who you are. If you are inherently late to every meeting, you should probably set your watch 15 minutes early.</p></div></div>`;
