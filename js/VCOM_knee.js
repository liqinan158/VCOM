Without <i>knees</i>, you'd walk like a Barbie doll on very stiff legs.</p><p class="long">The knee connects your tibia, or shinbone, to your femur, or thighbone. Although their bodies are arranged in different ways, there are other animals with knees, including horses, donkeys, giraffes, and deer. You can also use the word <i>knee</i> to mean the part of your pants that covers your actual knee: "I always get a hole in the <i>knee</i> of my jeans." A "<i>knee</i>-slapper" is a joke so funny it makes you laugh out loud.</p></div></div>`;
