You don't strike too hard — it’s just practice. Similarly, if you spar with words, you typically do it playfully and without anger. You might repeatedly spar with your mom about who makes the best meatloaf, but it’s all in good fun. <i>Spar</i> is also the name of a rigging pole, as well as of some light minerals like calcite, that you can cut through.</p></div></div>`;
