Cheese lovers often <i>debate</i> the merits of gorgonzola, triple creme brie, and gouda. Of course, they need to accompany their arguments with a taste test!</p><p class="long">A <i>debate</i> is a kind of respectful, well reasoned argument over opposing points of view, although tensions can run high and voices can be raised. In fact, the verb evolved from the Old French <i>debatre</i>, meaning “to fight.” Most formal debates, during a political campaign for example, keep the battles to a minimum. But if you find yourself in the midst of a debate between a Red Sox fan and a Yankees fan, things could get ugly!</p></div></div>`;
