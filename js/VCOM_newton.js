Just as meters measure distance, <i>newtons</i> measure force.</p><p class="long">The newton is named for Isaac Newton, the famous physicist. This can help you remember that <i>newton</i> is an important term in physics. For the International System of Units, the newton is a unit of force that could give one kilogram of mass a specific amount of acceleration: one meter per second per second. You can also say a newton is equal to the force of 100,000 dynes. Using newtons makes measuring forces, such as gravity, simpler and easier.</p></div>`;
