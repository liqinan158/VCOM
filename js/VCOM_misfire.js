var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">misfire</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When an engine or weapon <i>misfires</i>, it doesn't function or ignite correctly. When a plan <i>misfires</i>, it doesn't work quite the way you imagined it would.</p><p class="long">The original meaning of <i>misfire</i> is gun-related; when pulling a trigger doesn't result in the gun firing, the gun misfires. Around the turn of the 20th century, the word began to be used for combustion engines that couldn't get started because their fuel wouldn't ignite. Figuratively, <i>misfire</i> is good for describing ideas that don't ignite: "I'm afraid my plan to talk my parents into taking us to Disney World may <i>misfire</i> in the end."</p></div>`;
