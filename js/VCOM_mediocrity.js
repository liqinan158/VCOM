You can see how it still applies — in climbing the mountain — or ladder — of success, mediocrity is in the middle, neither leading the pack nor sprawling on ground, giving up. Such of person of this middle-level of success can also be called a <i>mediocrity</i>. That's a second definition of the word.</p></div></div>`;
