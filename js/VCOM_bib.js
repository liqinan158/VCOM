If you feed a toddler without using a <i>bib</i>, you'll quickly learn how useful it can be.</p><p class="long">A baby's bib is just one type â€” there is also the bib that makes up the top part of overalls or an apron, the section that covers the chest. Sometimes the corresponding part of a bird's body, a patch of color on the chest, is also called a <i>bib</i>. The word stems from the now-obsolete verb <i>bibben</i>, "to drink," which is thought to be imitative of the sound your lips make as they sip liquid.</p></div></div>`;
