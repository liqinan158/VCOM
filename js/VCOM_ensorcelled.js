Your cat may be totally <i>ensorcelled</i> by the hummingbirds flitting around the feeder just outside your window.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>ensorcelled</i> and its related verb, <i>ensorcell</i>, come from the French <i>ensorcerer</i>, "bewitch." It shares a root with <i>sorcery</i>, as well as a sense of magic or the supernatural. If you find yourself mesmerized by something, feel free to use this old fashioned word to capture the feeling: "It may seem silly, but I'm completely ensorcelled by those cooking shows on TV."</p></div></div>`;
