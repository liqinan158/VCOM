In other words, it’s just a title. There’s no power behind it.</p><p class="long">We get <i>titular</i> from the Latin word <i>titulus</i>, meaning "title." Nowadays, it means that you hold an official title but don’t have any power or responsibility along with it. The Queen of England is a titular head of state. She doesn’t actually govern. A <i>titular</i> director doesn’t direct. <i>Titular</i> can also mean referencing the title. If you're playing the role of Dave in the play <i>All About Dave</i>, you're playing the titular role.</p></div></div>`;
