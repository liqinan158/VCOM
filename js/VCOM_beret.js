If you enjoy French culture, you might don a <i>beret</i> while eating baguettes with brie.</p><p class="long">We can trace the origin of <i>beret</i> back to the Late Latin <i>birrus</i>, "large, hooded cloak," and since the word itself is French, the <i>t</i> is silent â€” <i>beret</i> rhymes with <i>tray</i>. From the time they were invented, berets have been casual, fashionable caps most often made of wool or felt. The armies of several countries, including Italy and the U.S. Special Forces, also wear berets as part of their uniform.</p></div>`;
