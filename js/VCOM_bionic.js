These are different from <i>prostheses</i>, or artificial limbs, because they copy exactly (or even exceed) the biology of the original part. Bionic body parts first entered popular culture in the 1970s, when the TV show <i>The Six Million Dollar Man</i> told the story of an injured astronaut whose bionic implants (a bionic eye, legs, and arm) gave him superhuman powers.</p></div>`;
