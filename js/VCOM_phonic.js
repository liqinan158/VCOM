Puns often rely on <i>phonic</i> similarities between words — like when you declare that the panda at the zoo has "the right to bear arms."</p><p class="long">In its singular form, <i>phonic</i> is generally used as a synonym for <i>phonetic</i> — both words describe the sounds of speech. The phonic elements of poetry are much clearer when it's read out loud, while the phonic variations between words in a foreign language can be tricky to distinguish from each other when you're just starting to learn it. Add an <i>s</i> and you get <i>phonics</i>, a method of teaching reading by sounding out letters.</p></div></div>`;
