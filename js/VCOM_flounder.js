var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">flounder</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>flounder</i> is a flat fish with both eyes on one side of its head; and, as a verb, to <i>flounder</i> is to wobble around like a fish out of water.</p><p class="long">To <i>flounder</i> is to be unsteady or uncertain. It's probably from the Dutch word <i>flodderen</i>, "to flop about," or it's a mix of <i>founder</i> ("to fail") and <i>blunder</i> ("do something clumsy"). If you flounder in the ocean, you need a surfer dude to scoop you up. You don't have to be in water, though; you can <i>flounder</i> any time you're a little wobbly â€” like after a long hike or during the last hour of the SATs. Either way, when you flounder, you wish you were a flat fish at the bottom of the sea.</p></div></div>`;
