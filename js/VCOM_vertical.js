var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">vertical</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Vertical</i> describes something that rises straight up from a horizontal line or plane. A telephone pole or a tree can usually be described as <i>vertical</i> in relation to the ground.</p><p class="long">The walls of your house — unless there's some terrible problem — are vertical. They rise straight up from the foundation, at a ninety degree angle. When you're standing up, you're vertical, as opposed to when you lie down in a horizontal position on the couch. The terms <i>vertical</i> and <i>horizontal</i> often describe directions: a vertical line goes up and down, and a horizontal line goes across. You can remember which direction is vertical by the letter, "v," which points down.</p></div>`;
