Think of a round chocolate chip cookie. The <i>diameter</i> of the cookie is a line that divides the cookie into two equal halves, through the center of the cookie.</p><p class="long">The <i>diameter</i> of a circle or sphere is a line that passes through the center and starts and ends and two opposite points on its perimeter or edge. The <i>diameter</i> is also the length of that line. In math class, teachers often ask you to use the <i>diameter</i> of a circle to find its area. This is a good skill to have if you are trying to figure out whether the 14 inch or 16 inch pizza is a better deal.</p></div>`;
