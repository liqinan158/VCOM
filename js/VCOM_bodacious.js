Sometimes it can mean attractive and sexy as well.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>bodacious</i> is probably a blend of the words <i>bold</i> and <i>audacious</i>. It's a southern term, associated for a time with surfers, who might admire a particularly "<i>bodacious</i> wave." That sense of admiration may be what's connected the word to its secondary meaning of attractive or sexy, as in "that party is going to be filled with <i>bodacious</i> babes."</p></div></div>`;
