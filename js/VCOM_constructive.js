It is the opposite of <i>destructive</i>, which means "tending to destroy." If you are a constructive member of a community, you are a positive force, interested in building up and improving your community. Youâ€™ll often hear this word used in the phrase "<i>constructive</i> criticism," which refers to helpful criticism intended to encourage improvement. Negative criticism, in contrast, is just intended to show a person they're wrong.</p></div>`;
