In fact, just the sound of the word <i>chuckle</i> may make you feeling like <i>chuckling</i>, or laughing softly.</p><p class="long"><i>Chuckle</i> is one of many words for different kinds of laughter. These include <i>giggle</i>, <i>titter</i>, <i>snicker</i>, and a word that is a cross between <i>chuckle</i> and <i>snort</i> â€” <i>chortle</i>. These words are all imitative. That is, the word itself sounds like the noise it refers to. With all these words for laughter, it may be hard to choose the right one for the occasion. Use <i>chuckle</i> when you mean a quiet, even soundless laugh.</p></div></div>`;
