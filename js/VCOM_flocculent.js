Sheep are <i>flocculent</i> before they're sheared, and much less <i>flocculent</i> afterward.</p><p class="long">The unusual adjective <i>flocculent</i> basically means "fluffy," although it's specific to the way wool is fluffy â€” in tufts. Your carefully styled hair might be flocculent after a drive in a convertible, for example. The root is the Latin word <i>floccus</i>, which means "lock of hair" or "tuft of wool."</p></div>`;
