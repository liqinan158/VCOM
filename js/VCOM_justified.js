The last character on each line would touch the right margin. The salutation (the part that says, "Dear Sir or Madam") would be left justified, with the <i>D</i> touching the left margin. The body of the letter could be left justified, with the right margin uneven, or fully justified, with both the right and left aligned.</p></div>`;
