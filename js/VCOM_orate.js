If you're giving a wedding toast, feel free to <i>orate</i>. However, if you're giving a friend advice, it's best to avoid <i>orating</i>.</p><p class="long">There are more and less appropriate situations in which to orate: a famous philosophy professor might be forgiven if she tends to orate when she's speaking about her favorite subject, Spinoza. But if you make an announcement at the dinner table, beginning with Julius Caesar's words, "Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!" your family will probably just laugh at you. The Latin root <i>orare</i> means "speak, pray, or plead."</p></div></div>`;
