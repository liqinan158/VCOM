Letters, official reports, teams of police — if it has somewhere to be, you can <i>dispatch</i> it to get there.</p><p class="long">Sometimes spelled <i>despatch</i>, this word was first used in the early 1500s as a verb meaning “to send off in a hurry.” These days we get hurried dispatches in noun and verb form, from journalists sending in their war zone stories to emergency squads getting dispatched to the scene of an accident. And in its most sinister sense, dispatch means to kill off without delay.</p></div></div>`;
