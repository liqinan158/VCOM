You can like a class, <i>yet</i> feel it's too hard. You may need to study hard <i>yet</i> again to try to pass a re-test. And even if an exam hasn't happened <i>yet</i>, you might worry it will be a disaster.</p><p class="long"><i>Yet</i> is often used like <i>but</i> when connecting two ideas that contrast â€” as in, "I love apples, <i>yet</i> I hate applesauce." When <i>yet</i> is not being used as a contrast, it means "more" or "in the future" (which is really just more time). If you've been rehearsing for the school play for weeks, but still don't know your lines, you'll need yet more rehearsals if it's going to be a success.</p></div>`;
