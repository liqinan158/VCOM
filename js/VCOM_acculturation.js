It means adopting the ways of a culture that isn't yours.</p><p class="long"><i>Acculturation</i> is related to the word <i>culture</i>.  Duh. <i>Culture</i> comes from a Latin word meaning, basically, farming.  Now it refers to basically anything that people create and teach each other â€” singing, dancing, TV. Obviously people in different parts of the world have different cultures, and when they come together, the result is often <i>acculturation</i>. Picture a French guy drinking Coke and wearing a baseball cap and you get the idea.</p></div>`;
