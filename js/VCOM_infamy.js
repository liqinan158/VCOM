You may be hoping for <i>fame</i> when you get an enormous tattoo of your favorite pop star on your back, but there's a chance you'll end up with <i>infamy</i> instead.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>infamy</i> is most often used to talk about famously evil or terrible people or historical events. The day the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, just before the start of World War II, was described by President Roosevelt as "a day that will live in infamy." <i>Infamy</i> contains the root word <i>fame</i>, but rather than meaning "the opposite of famous," its meaning is something closer to "fame gone bad."</p></div></div>`;
