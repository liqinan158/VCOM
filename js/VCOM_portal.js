You’re likely to find a <i>portal</i> in a castle, in a cathedral, or even on an internet site.</p><p class="long"><i>Portal</i> can be used to describe other types of doorways, both literal and metaphorical. For example, <i>portal</i> can refer to a web page that provides access to other sites on the web. If you enjoy reading science fiction or fantasy, you may be familiar with the use of the word <i>portal</i> to mean “a doorway to another world.” The wardrobe in C.S. Lewis’s <i>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</i> functions as a portal to the land of Narnia.</p></div></div>`;
