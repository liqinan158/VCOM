Another meaning of the noun <i>volley</i> involves just one projectile: a returned tennis ball, usually one that hasn't hit the ground before being smacked by a racket. The military meaning of <i>volley</i> has been around since the 1500's, while the sports meaning didn't arise until the late 1800's. The root word is the Latin <i>volare</i>, "to fly."</p></div>`;
