Chemically, turquoise is a mineral made of copper aluminum phosphate, but you're most likely to be familiar with its polished form, especially in rings and necklaces and belt buckles. Interestingly, the word for this traditionally Native American gem comes from a word that means "Turkish," based on its long-ago introduction from Turkey to other parts of Europe.</p></div></div>`;
