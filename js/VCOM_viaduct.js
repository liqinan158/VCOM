Most <i>viaducts</i> are a series of arches that span a road.</p><p class="long">Some viaducts stretch across train tracks, while other carry traffic across valleys, gorges, or bodies of water. What's distinctive about older viaducts is that they're usually made of equal-sized arches all linked into one long bridge. Newer viaducts can look simply like an elevated road or highway. The word <i>viaduct</i> combines the Latin <i>via</i>, or "road," with <i>ducere</i>, "to lead something."</p></div></div>`;
