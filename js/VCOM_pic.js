When you're visiting the Statue of Liberty, you might hand your camera to a stranger and ask if they'll take your <i>pic</i>.</p><p class="long">Use the informal <i>pic</i> as a slang term for <i>picture</i>. Your selfie-obsessed friend might insist on snapping pics of himself everywhere he goes, while your grandma might proudly show of the pics of her grandchildren she keeps in her wallet. You can also call a movie a <i>pic</i>. This word might sound fairly modern, but it's been around since the 1880s â€” not too long after photography was invented.</p></div></div>`;
