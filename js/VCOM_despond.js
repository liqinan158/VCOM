You could say that you tend to <i>despond</i> whenever you think about the end of summer.</p><p class="long">As a verb, <i>despond</i> is an old-fashioned word that you'll probably only see in books. It's much more common to hear the related words <i>despondent</i> and <i>despondence</i>. Still, if you don't mind sounding a little outdated, you can urge your little brother not to despond over his glass of spilled milk. The Latin root is <i>despondere</i>, "to give up, lose, lose heart, or resign."</p></div>`;
