You're balanced, grounded, and ready for action.</p><p class="long">A poised person exhibits composure and self-assuredness, which comes in handy, for instance, during a job interview, giving a public talk or debate, or playing sports. Watching the Olympics, you may wonder how gymnasts remain so poised when competing on the balance beam, considered the sport's most mentally and physically challenging event. <i>Poised</i> also means ready or on the verge: You can be poised for a leadership position, poised for battle, or poised to become music's next pop star.</p></div></div>`;
