You might be so weak that your <i>inanition</i> keeps you on the couch instead of meeting your friends for dinner.</p><p class="long">Inanition is the total absence of energy and liveliness. Many people experience inanition after a difficult work week or a physically difficult task, and inanition is also common when you're sick or depressed. Another cause of inanition is not having enough to eat. The Latin root, <i>inanitionem</i>, actually means "emptiness," and comes from <i>inanis</i>, "empty, void, worthless, or useless."</p></div>`;
