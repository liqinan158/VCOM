The gauze-like material is perfect for allowing moisture, or whey, to run out of cheese curds, leaving solid cheese behind. Cheesecloth is also useful in many other ways, both in the kitchen (covering food, straining soup) and out (wiping ink during the printmaking process, making lightweight clothing).</p></div></div>`;
