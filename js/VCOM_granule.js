If ants love to invade your kitchen, you'll need to carefully clean up every last <i>granule</i> of the sugar you spilled on the floor.</p><p class="long">In geology, a granule is actually a specific, measurable amount. It's between two and four millimeters â€” larger than a grain of sand, but smaller than a pebble. In everyday use, a granule is just a very small piece of something. If your little brother is especially sensitive, he may insist on periodically stopping during a hike to empty granules of gravel out of his sneakers. <i>Granule</i> comes from the Late Latin <i>granulum</i>, "small grain."</p></div>`;
