If your teacher suddenly started quacking like a duck, the class would look at him incredulously. When a student gives the wrong answer to an easy question, the teacher might incredulously say, "What?" If you're feeling <i>incredulous</i> (disbelieving), then you're probably acting incredulously.</p></div>`;
