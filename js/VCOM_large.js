If you realize your size has changed from medium to <i>large</i>, it might be time to cut back on the cupcakes.</p><p class="long">Something that is above average in size or number can be described with the adjective <i>large</i>. Your large collection of bottle caps, which covers the walls of three rooms in your house, is a perfect example. <i>Large</i> also describes something that covers a broad spectrum or scope.
