Land that is not level is called a <i>slope</i>. <i>Slope</i> can also be a verb, as in land that <i>slopes</i> down to sea level.</p><p class="long">Language experts believe the word <i>slope</i> came from the Middle English word <i>aslope</i>, an adverb that means “at an angle.” The word has a noun form you can use for something that is at an angle — on a <i>slope</i> — like a steep hill or the ramp in a parking garage. It also has a verb form that can be used to describe something that slants, like someone's signature with letters that slope to the left or an angled haircut that slopes to cover one eye.</p></div>`;
