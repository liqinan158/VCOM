To understand how the two meanings of <i>flourish</i> connect, remember that the word "flower" (spelled <i>flour-</i>) is hiding inside it. Flowers are used for decoration and ornamentation, but they also grow. Get it? Good for you! Imagine a cheerleader shouting out your name, flourishing her pom-poms.</p></div></div>`;
