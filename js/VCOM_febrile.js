It can be used in a medical sense when someone is sick and running a temperature, or in a figurative sense to describe a state of excitement or energy.</p><p class="long">When <i>febrile</i> is used to describe a fever due to illness, it is often used together with the word <i>seizure</i>. A <i>febrile</i> seizure is a seizure triggered by a fever. In a non-medical sense, the word can describe a state of excitement, as in, "The atmosphere in the city was <i>febrile</i> as the king's coronation date approached." You might think the <i>fe</i> in the word sounds like "fee," but it is actually pronounced "feh," as in <i>February</i>.</p></div></div>`;
