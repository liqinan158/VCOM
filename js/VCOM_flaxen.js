This word literally means "made of flax" or "the color of flax." <i>Flax</i> is a plant used to make a linen-like material also called flax, and <i>flaxen</i> originally described things made of this fabric. Today it's mainly used for hair or horses â€” the <i>flaxen gene</i> causes chestnut-colored horses to have blond tails.</p></div></div>`;
