A <i>structure</i> can be a skyscraper, an outhouse, your body, or a sentence.</p><p class="long"><i>Structure</i> is from the Latin word <i>structura</i> which means "a fitting together, building." Although it's certainly used to describe buildings, it can do more than that. A family's structure includes the relationship of its members, your body structure can refer to how your muscles and bones fit together. Sentence structure is how a sentence is put together, including subjects, verbs, and all that stuff English teachers love to yap about. <i>Structure</i> is usually a noun, but it can also be a verb meaning to impose order, like if you "<i>structure</i> an argument to convince your parents to let you stay out later."</p></div></div>`;
