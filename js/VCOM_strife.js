The years leading up to the U.S. Civil War were characterized by great <i>strife</i> between northern and southern states over slavery and the role of a federal government.</p><p class="long">This word applies to major issues and events, such as war and religious conflict: a period of civil <i>strife</i>. Like its Old French source, the original meaning of the English noun <i>strife</i> and the English verb <i>strive</i> had to do with an argument or quarrel. But the verb <i>strive</i> has lost that earlier sense, and now means to try hard to do or achieve something.</p></div>`;
