If you're unhappy, it's usually best to be honest about it, rather than pretending everything's <i>peachy</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Peachy</i> is an informal adjective that's mostly used by North Americans. You might hear a sports fan talking about how peachy things look for their favorite team, or a neighbor describing an absolutely peachy day at the beach. Every once in a while, you might even hear the term <i>peachy-keen</i> used this same way. It's even more common today to use <i>peachy</i> in a sarcastic or ironic way.</p></div></div>`;
