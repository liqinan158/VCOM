Other times it takes just a small salad to <i>sate</i> your appetite, or to satisfy your hunger.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>sate</i> comes from the Old English <i>sadian</i>, “to satiate,” and can be applied to any situation regarding the satisfaction of a need or an appetite.  If you have been craving something sweet, your craving might be sated by a bag of jellybeans. However, if it seems like you can never get enough jellybeans, your appetite for sweets might be described as <i>insatiable</i>, a word used to describe a person or entity whose appetites — literally or figuratively — are impossible to satisfy.</p></div>`;
