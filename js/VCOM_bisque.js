Your favorite seafood restaurant might make a delicious lobster <i>bisque</i>.</p><p class="long">A classic French bisque is made with broth from shellfish — either crab, lobster, shrimp, or crayfish — although thick, cream-based vegetable soups are often also called bisques.

The word <i>bisque</i>, "crayfish soup" in French, stems either from the Bay of Biscay or the technique of <i>bis cuites</i>, or "twice cooked."</p></div></div>`;
