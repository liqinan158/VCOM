The <i>endeavour</i> itself is the thing you're striving for, the enterprise or undertaking. It's a primarily British spelling of the word.</p><p class="long">The Middle English root of <i>endeavour</i> means to "put oneself in" or "do one's utmost," so if you endeavour to do something, you do it with earnestness and a fair amount of effort. Americans usually spell the word <i>endeavor</i>, but NASA named one of its space shuttles the <i>Endeavour</i>. Why the extra "u"? NASA was honoring the HMS <i>Endeavour</i>, the first ship ever used by the British explorer Captain James Cook.</p></div></div>`;
