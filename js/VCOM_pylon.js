You might notice the <i>pylons</i> underpinning your city's elevated train tracks.</p><p class="long">Pylons are often made of steel or concrete, because they are strong substances that can hold a large amount of weight. A pylon needs to be sturdy, since it is supporting a bridge, road, or power lines. Other pylons act as navigational aids, marking paths for cars or small planes. The word's original meaning was "gateway to an Egyptian temple." <i>Pylon</i> is a Greek word that means "gateway," from <i>pyle</i>, "gate or entrance."</p></div></div>`;
