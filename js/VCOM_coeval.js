The beginning of Major League Baseball is coeval with the invention of the telephone. People can be coeval, though more often you'll hear <i>contemporary</i> used to describe people who are about the same age. You and your contemporaries probably view the world a lot differently than your grandparents' generation.</p></div></div>`;
