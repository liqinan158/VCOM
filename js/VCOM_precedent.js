It's hard to say what the legal community would do without the word <i>precedent</i>, since so many legal judgments and decisions are based on what came before.</p><p class="long">Lawyers and judges often look for a precedent that can be used as a guide for a similar case. This word is used elsewhere too. Your mom might not let you stay up late because it would set a bad precedent for future bedtimes. A teacher who lets kids chew gum is setting a precedent that gum-chewing will be OK in the future. People often refer to a precedent later on as a reference point for how things should be.</p></div></div>`;
