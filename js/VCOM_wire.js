If you wear braces, you might even have wire in your mouth.</p><p class="long">Most wire is a tubular strand of metal, like the wire in jewelry or in the fence around your chicken coop. There's also braided wire coated in protective plastic to make cables for connecting electronic equipment or transmitting signals. In the old days, you might've sent a wire, or telegram, to a friend. And if you wear a wire, that's a secret recording device. As a verb, <i>wire</i> originally meant "adorn with gold wire." Today it means "install wires" like when you wire a new house for electricity.</p></div>`;
