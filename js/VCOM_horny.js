The thick, hard nail on your big toe could be described as <i>horny</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>horny</i>, describing the bony projection on an animal's head, appeared in English before the 10th century. An informal meaning — that of being sexually aroused — appeared later. Male physical arousal was crudely referred to as "having the horn” in the late 18th century before becoming the word <i>horny</i> in the mid-19th century. First used exclusively for men, the word now describes women's sexual feelings as well.</p></div></div>`;
