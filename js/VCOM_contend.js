var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">contend</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To defend a belief or keep affirming that it's true is to <i>contend</i>. People used to contend that the earth was flat, but eventually, when no one dropped off the edge no matter how far they traveled, the "round" theory won.</p><p class="long">One of the meanings of <i>contend</i> is from the French "to strive with," and it is a literal fighting, as in "to contend with fists." Most contemporary uses of the verb <i>contend</i> illustrate competitions of proof or defense, where a person will contend that something is true, or better, or wrong. It is still a striving but more of a verbal kind, where what you contend is what you hope to convince others is correct.</p></div></div>`;
