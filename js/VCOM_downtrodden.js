An exploited, underpaid worker is <i>downtrodden</i>.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>downtrodden</i> is more often used to talk about groups of oppressed people, rather than one specific person. A history textbook might discuss the downtrodden masses rising up in a revolution against their rulers, for example. In the 1560s, <i>downtrodden</i> was first used to literally mean "stepped on," with the figurative meaning following soon after. <i>Trodden</i>, "that which is stepped on," comes from the verb <i>tread</i>.</p></div></div>`;
