It's a hoped-for mutual respect and friendliness, although too infrequently the case in politics and business.</p><p class="long"><i>Comity</i> is one of those rare words that has retained its original meaning through the ages. The Latin adjective <i>cōmis</i>, "courteous, friendly," developed into the noun <i>cōmitātem</i>, meaning "courtesy or friendliness" and ultimately into English <i>comity</i> in the 16th century. The phrase "<i>comity</i> of nations," coined in 1862, refers to the mutual respect for each other's laws and institutions that encourages a friendly back-and-forth between nations.</p></div>`;
