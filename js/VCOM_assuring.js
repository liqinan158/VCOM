var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">assuring</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If you are <i>assuring</i>, you relieve someone else’s fears. When your kid sister takes her first dive off the high dive, you might want to give her an <i>assuring</i> pat on the back . . . or a push.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>assure</i> has origins in the Old French word <i>asseurer</i>, meaning “to reassure, calm, protect, and render sure.” If you are a coach, you may find yourself assuring your athletes of their preparedness and ability so they overcome their game-day jitters and have the confidence to do their best. Assuring can be used as an adjective, too: you are an assuring parent if you exhibit confidence in your child’s abilities, which will bolster his self confidence.</p></div></div>`;
