Doctors who specialize in <i>audiology</i> are called <i>audiologists</i>.</p><p class="long">An audiology clinic or department offers various kinds of testing to determine whether a person can hear normally, and if not, which frequencies of the person's hearing have been affected. Balance disorders and tinnitus — a persistent ringing in the ears — also fall under the expertise of audiology practitioners. If you needed a hearing aid, you might go to an audiology clinic. <i>Audiology</i> combines <i>audio-</i>, or "sound," from the Latin root <i>audire</i>, "hear," and <i>-ology</i>, "branch of knowledge."</p></div></div>`;
