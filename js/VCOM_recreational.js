If you're not a professional golfer but love the game, it's <i>recreational</i>.</p><p class="long">Anything you do because you enjoy it — rather than because you are obligated to do it — is recreational. Hiking, reading, and visiting museums can all be described this way. <i>Recreational</i> means "something done for recreation," and <i>recreation</i>, which was originally "the curing of a sick person," combines the Latin <i>re</i>, "again" and <i>creare</i>, "to create." Today we think of recreational activities as curing our boredom.</p></div>`;
