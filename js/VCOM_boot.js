To <i>boot</i> means to kick something (with or without the fancy footwear).</p><p class="long">Like most fashionable things, the word <i>boot</i> comes from the Old French <i>bote</i>. It used to refer only to riding boots, but now any big ol’ high-rise shoe kind of thing is a boot. Since boots are for feet, when you boot someone, you kick them. If you give someone the boot, you’re kicking him out. A totally different type of booting involves starting up an operating system on a computer.</p></div></div>`;
