If you have an <i>instinctive</i> desire to help animals, you might automatically stop your car to pick up every stray dog you see.</p><p class="long">Something that is <i>instinctive</i> occurs naturally, the way babies know how to cry and suck as soon as they're born. Adults also have instinctive reflexes — like yawning, or the reflex that makes you kick your leg when the doctor hits your knee with a rubber mallet. Sometimes your instinctive reflexes can save your life — like when the "fight or flight" instinct warns you that danger is present.</p></div></div>`;
