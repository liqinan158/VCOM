It is plain on the back, thick and soft on the front, and its texture has led to the word's use as an adjective to describe something soft and smooth, like a dog's velvet ear. Even a rich, smooth singing voice can be described as velvet. The Latin root, <i>villus</i>, simply means "shaggy cloth" or "tuft of hair."</p></div></div>`;
