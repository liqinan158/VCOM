A car crash, a violent scene in a movie, and an expos√© on what's really in your fast food hamburger can all be described as <i>horrifying</i>.</p><p class="long">Something that scares you to death, like the sound of footsteps upstairs in your dark, empty house or the sight of a bear on the hiking trail, is horrifying. Equally horrifying are things that sicken you, like photographs from a battlefield or the description of a painful dental procedure. <i>Horrifying</i> things inspire <i>horror</i>, originally a Latin word meaning both "dread" and "religious awe," from <i>horrere</i>, "to bristle with fear."</p></div></div>`;
