A lack of sunshine in your back yard might <i>etiolate</i> the roses you planted there.</p><p class="long">You can use <i>etiolate</i> to describe what your uncle does to his house plants when he keeps his curtains closed for weeks — causing them to grow long, pale stems and tiny leaves from lack of sunlight. It's more common to find <i>etiolate</i> and the noun <i>etiolation</i> in science textbooks or botanists' studies. <i>Etiolate</i> comes from the French word <i>étioler</i>, "to blanch," and experts speculate that it may literally mean "to become like straw," from the French Norman <i>étule</i>, "a straw."</p></div>`;
