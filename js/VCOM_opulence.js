You'll need gold brocaded curtains, diamond-encrusted watches, and a world-renowned personal chef if you want to add some <i>opulence</i> to your life.</p><p class="long">Not surprisingly, the noun <i>opulence</i> comes from the Latin <i>opulentia</i>, meaning “wealthy.” A word that suggests extravagant excess, <i>opulence</i> describes lavish and visibly over-the-top living. Synonyms include <i>abundance</i>, <i>prosperity</i>, and <i>riches</i>. Said the novelist Joseph Conrad, “Protection is the first necessity of <i>opulence</i> and luxury.” Meaning, first secure one’s riches and safety, and then enjoy without a care in the world!</p></div>`;
