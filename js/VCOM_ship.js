You can <i>ship</i> things on a <i>ship</i> — but, confusingly, you can also <i>ship</i> them on a truck or a train.</p><p class="long">A ship is like a boat, only larger — some definitions of a sailing ship say it has at least three masts. A cruise ship transports a large number of people in what is basically a floating hotel. A cargo ship, on the other hand, transports goods being imported and exported between countries. One guess about the origin of <i>ship</i> links it to a Germanic word meaning "hollowed-out tree."</p></div></div>`;
