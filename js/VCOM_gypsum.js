If you're studying chemistry or just want to build something, you may encounter gypsum, which is a white, chalky (or sometimes colorless) mineral used to make plaster of Paris and other building materials such as cement. Plaster of Paris is named from the massive gypsum deposits of Montmartre in Paris. But you won’t just find gypsum in art class.
