A military <i>outpost</i> acts as a guard or defense against an enemy's attack on the larger military force.</p><p class="long">Whenever a small group of people sets up a camp at a distance from the main, larger organization (whether it's military or not), you can call their settlement an <i>outpost</i>. Explorers in the early days of the US set up outposts throughout the West, and many countries establish outposts near their borders with hostile neighbors â€” encampments for keeping an eye on them. The first written use of <i>outpost</i> is usually ascribed to George Washington.</p></div>`;
