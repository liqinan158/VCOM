If you feel like dancing around the maypole or celebrating your Olympic victory, you might wear a wreath of spring flowers or laurels on your head. You might also want to remember someone who's passed away by placing a wreath on their grave.  Wreaths don’t have to be green — you can carve gold or wood into a wreath or you can even have a mountain peak with a wreath of clouds around it.</p></div></div>`;
