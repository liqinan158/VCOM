When you saw the pretty new girl at school smiling at you, you were so <i>stricken</i> you walked right into a wall.</p><p class="long"><i>Stricken</i> means "affected," whether it's in a good way — being so stricken by spring fever that you can't stop singing and goofing around — or bad, like being stricken by a real fever and a sore throat and the chills and. . . you get the idea. You can also be stricken by fear, like a family so stricken by fear of bedbugs that they cancelled their hotel reservation and just slept in their car.</p></div>`;
