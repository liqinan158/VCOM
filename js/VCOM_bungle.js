Ever said something awkward in front of a grandparent or dropped a cake on someone’s lap?  Those are bungles — accidents that make you blush. <i>Bungle</i> can also be used as a verb when someone acts like a fool or simply messes everything up, as in “The teacher <i>bungled</i> her lecture because she left her notes at home,” or “My <i>bungling</i> dad fell into the punch bowl.  Again.”</p></div>`;
