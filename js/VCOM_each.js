If all the guests at your party will go home with a goody bag, you can say that <i>each</i> person will get one.</p><p class="long">The word <i>each</i> is useful for singling out one instance, item, or person from a larger group. When it's used as an adverb, it basically means "apiece." You might, for example, say, "These cupcakes cost me three dollars <i>each</i>," or "My siblings and I have one cat <i>each</i> â€” all together, we have six cats in our family." The Old English root of <i>each</i>, <i>, is based on a Germanic phrase that means "ever alike."</i></p></div></div>`;
