In legal language, <i>guardian</i> is typically used as an alternative to "parent."</p><p class="long">Guardians are often adults who can make legal decisions for children who are not their own. Sometimes they take care of them, too, just like a parent would. A guardian angel is a figure that some people believe (either seriously or jokingly) watches over them and protects them.
