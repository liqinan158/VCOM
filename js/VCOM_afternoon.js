If you have an <i>afternoon</i> appointment, it's probably some time between 12:00 and 5:00 p.m.</p><p class="long">It's pretty much agreed that the afternoon begins after noon, or 12:00 p.m., but when the afternoon ends and evening begins is a bit more vague. Still, if you ask a friend to meet you for coffee in the afternoon, she will know what you mean. You can even use the word <i>afternoon</i> as a casual greeting, short for "Good <i>afternoon</i>!" In Middle English, the word was <i>aftermete</i>, meaning "after the noon meal."</p></div>`;
