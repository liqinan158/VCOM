Maybe you prefer tragic movies because you enjoy the sentiment of sadness. This meaning of <i>sentiment</i> is taken to an extreme in yet another version of the word, meaning something like "overdone, exaggerated feelings, especially of sadness or nostalgia." An overly soppy tragedy is a good example of this kind of sentiment; it's the kind of film that might make you cringe instead of cry.</p></div>`;
