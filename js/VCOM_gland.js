If you feel sick, your doctor may feel your neck to see if your <i>glands</i> are swollen.</p><p class="long">When your body is fighting off an infection, your glands may swell as they defend against the bacteria or virus. In addition to fighting illness, glands do all kinds of good work in your body, from regulating your metabolism to secreting hormones that control the rate at which you grow. The Latin source of <i>gland</i> is <i>glandula</i>, "gland of the throat," from <i>glans</i>, "acorn-shaped ball."</p></div>`;
