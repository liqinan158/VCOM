It is often used to describe colors, clothing, decorations, and other things that can be elegant and tasteful. Because the word connotes bad taste, however, it is rarely used in a complimentary way. If you say to your friend, "I like your <i>garish</i> hair and makeup," she is not likely to take it well, unless, of course, you are going to a 70s flashback party.</p></div></div>`;
