If you yawn while your friend is crying about her lost cat, you'll come across as terribly <i>unsympathetic</i>.</p><p class="long">There are a few ways to use <i>unsympathetic</i>. If you lack sympathy (a feeling of sadness on behalf of someone else), you're unsympathetic: "I'm unsympathetic about her missing cashmere scarf, since I happen to know she has three more at home." It can also mean "unappealing" or "unlikeable." Darth Vader, up to a point, is a decidedly unsympathetic movie character. Finally, it can mean "disapproving," as in your unsympathetic opinion of an elected official whose policies you disagree with.</p></div>`;
