A simple <i>bouquet</i> of flowers from your garden makes a lovely centerpiece for your table or a nice hostess gift when you are a guest.</p><p class="long">The word <i>bouquet</i> comes from the Old French term meaning "clump of trees." Because it would be difficult for a bride to lug a clump of trees down the aisle at her wedding, thankfully the word now means "a small bunch of arranged flowers." <i>Bouquet</i> can also describe the scent of these flowers, or anything that is a blend of scents, like perfume or wine.</p></div>`;
