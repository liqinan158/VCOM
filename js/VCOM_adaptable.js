The level to which a species is adaptable to changing surroundings is an important factor in the study of evolution.</p><p class="long">Let’s look at the Latin word <i>adaptāre</i>, from the root <i>aptus</i> "fitted." The <i>ad-</i> means "to, while the <i>aptare</i> means "join." Since 15th-century medieval French, the word <i>adapt</i> has come to mean "to fit in or adjust." So something adaptable is something that "fits in or adjusts." An example of an adaptable creature is the arctic fox, whose fur changes from dirt-dark in summer to snow-white in winter, to better blend in with its surroundings.</p></div>`;
