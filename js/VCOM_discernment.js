If you're voting for Student Council President, you need to use <i>discernment</i> to pick the best candidate.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>discernment</i> describes a wise way of judging between things, or a particularly perceptive way of seeing things. If you can understand something that's somewhat hidden or obscure — if you figure out the themes of a confusing movie, for example — you're using discernment. It comes from the Latin word <i>discernere</i>, meaning "separate." Discernment separates what's important or true from what's not.</p></div></div>`;
