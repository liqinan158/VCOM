Dog trainers teach dogs to follow commands â€” and they teach dog owners to give commands effectively. The noun <i>trainer</i> comes from the verb <i>train</i>, "to discipline or teach," from an earlier sense, "to manipulate to bring a desired form," the way a gardener trains a rose to grow up a trellis.</p></div>`;
