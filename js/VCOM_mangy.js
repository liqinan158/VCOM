A <i>mangy</i> dog has a skin disease carried by mites that causes the animal to lose its hair and develop crusty patches on its body. Or, if you own a <i>mangy</i> sweater, it is probably threadbare and stained. As you can imagine, you should probably think twice before calling a person <i>mangy</i>!</p></div></div>`;
