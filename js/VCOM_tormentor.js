If your sister keeps tickling you after you desperately beg her not to, feel free to call her your <i>tormentor</i>.</p><p class="long">A tormentor is a person who torments, and both words are strongly related to <i>torture</i> â€” they share a root that means "to twist." A tormentor doesn't torture once, though, but inflicts pain over a long period of time. While <i>tormentor</i> is often used in a light-hearted way, as when you say your devilish new kitten is your Great Dane's tormentor, it can also be used with reference to serious situations.</p></div>`;
