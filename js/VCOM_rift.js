When there is a <i>rift</i> in a political party over a particular policy, it is like a rip or tear in the fabric of the group.</p><p class="long"><i>Rift</i> has a slightly different sense than <i>break</i>. A group can have a rift without having fully broken apart. A rift can heal, though a break is permanent. A rift can arise between sisters over whose turn it is to do dishes; it can quickly heal when parents promise an ice cream trip when the dishes are done. The Earth's crust has rifts, where it's splitting apart, like in East Africa.</p></div>`;
