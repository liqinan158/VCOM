But as both a noun and an adjective, the word is most often used by scientists to talk about anything — life, rocks, or environments on other planets — that happens outside of the earth's atmosphere. This makes sense when you know that in Latin, <i>extra</i> means "outside" and <i>terra</i> means "earth."</p></div></div>`;
