When you're worried about something, you might sleep <i>restlessly</i>, waking several times throughout the night.</p><p class="long">Someone who sits restlessly through a boring class might fidget, and a crowd waiting restlessly for a band to come on stage may mill around in an impatient way. When you're <i>restless</i>, you're bored or anxious, and acting restlessly means demonstrating those feelings. The similar Old English word <i>restleas</i> meant "deprived of sleep."</p></div></div>`;
