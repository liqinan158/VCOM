Most high schools have science <i>labs</i> for biology and chemistry classes.</p><p class="long"><i>Lab</i> is shorthand for <i>laboratory</i>, with its Medieval Latin root <i>laboratorium</i>, "a place for labor or work," from the Latin <i>laborare</i>, "to work." Many scientists and researchers go to work each day in a lab (often wearing a "<i>lab</i> coat," a white smock that protects their clothes). Some labs are equipped for studying the way plants grow and reproduce, while in others scientists study the brainwaves of human subjects or the traits of a virus. If you are a scientist, chances are you hang out in a lab.</p></div></div>`;
