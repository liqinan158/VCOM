Gorillas are vegetarians whose native habitat is the forest of central west Africa. The word <i>gorilla</i> is sometimes also used to refer to a big, aggressive man. It was first coined in the 19th century by a United States missionary to Africa, from the Greek word <i>gorillai</i> — the word Carthaginian explorer Hanno used to mean "wild, hairy people" in 500 B.C.E.</p></div></div>`;
