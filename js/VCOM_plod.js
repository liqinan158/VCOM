You might need to <i>plod</i> through the snow to get to the bus stop on time.</p><p class="long"><i>Plod</i> evokes a difficulty in walking — like when you trudge through mud or walk slowly up a steep hill. You might plod home at the end of a long day, or plod through an overgrown field on a hot afternoon. You can also use <i>plod</i> figuratively to mean "work on something boring or monotonous." The origin of <i>plod</i> is unknown, but it may have come from the sound of feet on the ground — the sound you make when you plod.</p></div>`;
