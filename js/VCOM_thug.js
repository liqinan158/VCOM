A <i>thug</i> might break into someone's house, push its owners around, and steal their TV.</p><p class="long">It's hard to reason with thugs, since they'd rather intimidate and physically hurt people than talk. A playground bully is one kind of thug, and an armed robber is an even more dangerous one. The noun <i>thug</i> may have its oldest roots in the Sanskrit word <i>sthaga-s</i>, "cunning or fraudulent," and it's definitely related to the Marathi and Hindi <i>thag</i>, "cheat or swindler." The earliest use of <i>thug</i>, from 1810, was "member of a murdering gang of robbers in India."</p></div></div>`;
