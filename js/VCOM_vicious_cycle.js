If you can’t you can’t get a job without experience, but you can’t get experience without a job, then you are in a <i>vicious cycle</i>.</p><p class="long">You can also call it a <i>vicious circle</i> — either way, it's a kind of loop in which an event has a consequence that not only keeps it going, but strengthens the original event or action. Ultimately the entire cycle starts all over again. An example of a vicious cycle is when you can't sign in without your password, but you can’t get your password without signing in. For a solution, you need to find a way to break the cycle — by contacting IT support, perhaps.</p></div>`;
