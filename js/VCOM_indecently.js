If your grandmother complains that your party guests are <i>indecently</i> dressed, she probably thinks their clothes are too skimpy.</p><p class="long">Many people in the audience will be offended if a political figure jokes indecently, and being treated indecently by a police officer is a good reason to file an official complaint. <i>Indecently</i> comes from the adjective <i>indecent</i>, "inappropriate or in bad taste." The Latin <i>indecentem</i> is the source, from <i>in-</i>, "not," and <i>decens</i>, "becoming, fitting, or proper."</p></div></div>`;
