var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">sap</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>sap</i> something is to drain or deplete something over time.  If you <i>sap</i> a maple tree, you drain the liquid inside it to make maple syrup.  But if you <i>sap</i> a person of strength, you've rendered him defenseless.</p><p class="long">Whether used as a noun or verb, <i>sap</i> is rarely a good thing. If your energy or will is sapped, it’s not meant lightly; it means you have been exhausted of all your reserve energy, you’re reduced to a shell. If someone calls you "a <i>sap</i>," it suggests you lack strength and character. And if you get sap — the sticky liquid inside a tree — on your hands, good luck getting it off in the middle of a forest without a bar of soap and running water.  Yuck.</p></div>`;
