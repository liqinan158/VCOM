If you think your hotel room has a <i>view</i> of the ocean, it'll be disappointing to open the blinds and discover your <i>view</i> of a Dumpster instead.</p><p class="long">The range of what you can see is also called your <i>view</i>. When you're keeping an eye on kids at the beach, you try to keep them in your view. As a verb, <i>view</i> means to watch. It might be hard for you to sit still while you view a really scary movie, or even to keep from screaming out loud.</p></div>`;
