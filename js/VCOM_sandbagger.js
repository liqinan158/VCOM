In the law, if you know that a contract or warranty isn't valid, but you pretend to trust it so that you can sue later â€” you're a sandbagger. And in various sports and games, you're considered a sandbagger when you pretend to be less skilled than you really are so you can score higher or play with an unfairly high handicap.</p></div></div>`;
