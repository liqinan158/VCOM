If the <i>aglets</i> wear off, it can be hard to lace up your old basketball sneakers.</p><p class="long">There are two ways to spell this very specific thing, the plastic or metal shoelace tip that makes it fit more easily through the eyelets in your shoes: <i>aglet</i> and <i>aiglet</i>. Sometimes the aglet makes your life easier, and in other cases it's just for decoration. The Middle French root is <i>aiguillette</i>, a diminutive of <i>aiguille</i>, "needle," from the Latin <i>acus</i>, which also means "needle," by way of its own diminutive, the Late Latin <i>acucula</i>.</p></div>`;
