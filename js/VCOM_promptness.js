German trains, which tend to pull into the station at the exact scheduled time, are famous for their <i>promptness</i>.</p><p class="long">When someone compliments your promptness, they're either admiring your tendency to act immediately or your punctuality. If someone calls an ambulance for a medical emergency, its promptness is vital â€” someone's life could be on the line, so quick action is important. And when you have to catch an airplane, your taxi's promptness matters too. If you asked for a ride at 12:30 and your driver pulls up at precisely 12:30, you should thank her for her promptness (or just leave a nice tip).</p></div>`;
