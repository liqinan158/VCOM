Whee! <i>Sledding</i> down a hill is fun, but dragging the sled back up is way less fun.</p><p class="long">In some parts of the world, people call this sport "sledging" or "tobogganing." While sledding is generally seen as more of a pastime than an actual sport, it's also the basis of Olympic sports like luge and bobsledding. Add some dogs and you have dog sledding. <i>Sledding</i> comes from the verb <i>sled</i>, which meant "transport or travel by sled" before it meant "ride on a sled."</p></div>`;
