It's a traditional Christmas decoration that is also frequently used in India for wedding celebrations and other ceremonies. You can also use the word <i>tinsel</i> to refer to things that look fancy but are actually worthless—which is where Hollywood's nickname, Tinseltown, comes from.</p></div>`;
