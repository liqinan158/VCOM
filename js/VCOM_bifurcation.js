If a stream divides into two smaller streams, that's a bifurcation. If you split a company into two divisions, that's a bifurcation too. This word can also refer to the exact spot where one thing splits into two. Since <i>bi</i> means two in many words, such as <i>bimonthly</i>, that's a good reminder of what bifurcation means.</p></div></div>`;
