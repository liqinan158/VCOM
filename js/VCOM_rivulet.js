A <i>rivulet</i> is to a river as a baby is to an adult.</p><p class="long">There are several ways to remember this word. One is the similarity of its sound to "river." Another is the suffix <i>-let</i>, which indicates small things. For example, a piglet is a small pig or baby pig. A 300-pound pig probably wouldn't drown in a tiny rivulet, but a piglet should stay clear. Another word for <i>rivulet</i> is "streamlet."</p></div>`;
