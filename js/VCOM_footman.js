There aren't many <i>footmen</i> left these days, although you can still find some working for the British royal family.</p><p class="long">It was once common for wealthy families to employ uniform-wearing male servants. These footmen, usually young men, served food at the dinner table, filled in for absent butlers, carried heavy things, and opened and closed doors. The word <i>footman</i> comes from the original job of a <i>running footman</i> â€” an agile servant would run beside his master's carriage making sure it didn't tip over. Earlier, a footman was a "soldier who travels on foot," rather than on horseback.</p></div></div>`;
