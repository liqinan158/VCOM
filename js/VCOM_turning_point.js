Historians might say that Rosa Parks's famous bus protest was a <i>turning point</i> in the Civil Rights Movement.</p><p class="long">Looking back at historical events, it's fairly easy to mark various turning points. An individual might notice a turning point as well, like the day you met your best friend or the summer you spent volunteering in India. This figurative meaning of <i>turning point</i> was coined in the 1640s, while a less popular, more literal meaning came along about forty years later: "point at which motion in one direction ceases and that in another or contrary direction begins."</p></div>`;
