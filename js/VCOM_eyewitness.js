If you're an <i>eyewitness</i> to a car accident, the police might want to ask you exactly what you saw.</p><p class="long">An eyewitness is valuable to crime investigators because she has seen the incident happen with her own eyes. You could also be an eyewitness to something less serious, like a boy being mean to his younger brother when he thinks no one is watching, or a woman throwing her soda can on the ground. While a witness may have valuable information about something, an <i>eyewitness</i> is even more important because he has actually seen — or witnessed — the event in question.</p></div></div>`;
