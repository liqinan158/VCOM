If your bedroom looks like a hurricane just hit it, you might describe it as a <i>muddle</i>.</p><p class="long">Oftentimes, we create the muddles in our lives, so it’s appropriate that <i>muddle</i> can be used as a verb meaning “to mix up” or “confuse.” Conveniently, though, the word <i>muddle</i> also describes a way out of difficult situations; to muddle through a troublesome task is to somehow figure it out, even if you don’t quite know what you’re doing. It has been suggested that <i>muddle</i> comes from an old Dutch word meaning “to make muddy.”</p></div></div>`;
