An <i>exposed</i> hillside isn't sheltered by hills, trees, or buildings, but is completely open to the wind and weather.</p><p class="long">If you venture out on a bitterly cold day with no gloves, your exposed fingers might get frostbite, and a soldier in battle with no body armor is dangerously exposed. If you leave a wooden chair outside all year long, exposed to rain and snow and sun, it will eventually fall apart. <i>Exposed</i> comes from the verb <i>expose</i>, "leave without shelter or defense," from the Latin root <i>exponere</i>, "lay open or reveal."</p></div></div>`;
