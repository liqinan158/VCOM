This later came to mean "human being," a meaning it still conveys.  You can also use it to refer to a person's physical body. I wouldn't recommend crossing the border with any illegal items on your person.   Nowadays, the word <i>person</i> replaces "man" to avoid sexism in words such as "congressperson."</p></div>`;
