Or, if your bedroom is very dark, your mother might want you to open the blinds and let some light into that <i>cavern</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>cavern</i> is a late Middle English word that comes from the Latin root <i>cavus</i>, meaning “hollow.” <i>Cavern</i> typically describes a cave, but it can refer to any large enclosed space, especially a space that's dark like a cave. You might sit in a vast cavern when you go to the opera. <i>Cavern</i> can also be used figuratively — you could explore the dark cavern of your mind.</p></div>`;
