Either way, you're overwhelmed with emotion immediately, the first time you see someone. Another way to use this adverb phrase is to mean "from a first impression." So you might say, "My cat is much meaner than he seems to be <i>at first sight</i>. Be very careful when you pet him."</p></div></div>`;
