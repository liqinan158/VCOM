That means if you buy something, it’s yours. No returns, no take backs. No need to save that receipt.</p><p class="long">If you see the words <i>caveat emptor</i>, the person selling you something won't let you return it, so you better check it out thoroughly before you hand over the cash. You, the buyer, are taking a chance. If that flying car you bought doesn’t soar, tough luck. A seller will say or write <i>caveat emptor</i> to avoid an argument later.</p></div>`;
