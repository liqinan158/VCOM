Marriage is often associated with this joyous feeling: people who are married and still in love are described as living in wedded <i>bliss</i>.</p><p class="long">Another common association is heaven or paradise, as in eternal bliss. <i>Bliss</i> is from Middle English <i>blisse,</i> from Old English <i>bliss,</i> <i>blīths</i>. The final <i>-s</i> in this Old English word is actually a suffix and the word itself is related to <i>blīthe,</i> the source of modern English <i>blithe</i>, which means happy.</p></div>`;
