The truth is that many faiths, including Hinduism, Judaism, and Christianity, have their own forms of mysticism, placing an emphasis on spiritual connection and union, and the mysteries of religion over dogma or rigid rules. Outside of religion, <i>mysticism</i> is applied to cryptic, obscure, or irrational thought — leaning toward mystery and wonder, rather than logic.</p></div></div>`;
