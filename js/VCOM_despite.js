You might go see a movie <i>despite</i> hearing a review calling it worse than <i>Ishtar</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Despite</i> is just one letter away from <i>despise</i>, and they actually share a root: the Latin verb <i>despicere</i>, meaning "to look down on scornfully." <i>Despite</i> came to mean "contempt" or "scorn" in English, though that use as a noun has mostly dropped out of use. The phrase "in despite of" gradually got shortened to the preposition <i>despite</i> and lost its scornful quality. If you accomplish something <i>despite</i> the obstacles in your way, there's no need to feel spiteful about it.</p></div>`;
