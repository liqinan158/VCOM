Small jobs in the short term give you experience for a long-term career.</p><p class="long"><i>Career</i> comes from the French <i>carri√®re</i>, from an older word for "street" or "road." Staying on track for a certain career is like driving a car in one direction on a road, instead of veering in different directions. Maybe the expression "<i>career</i> path" is helpful in remembering that a career is something that progresses, or moves forward on a set path. It can also be used as a verb to describe something moving quickly and uncontrollably, like a car careering into a ditch.</p></div>`;
