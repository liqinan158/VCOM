You might sit outside at night to see the full moon, <i>aglow</i> in the dark sky.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>aglow</i> is a poetic, slightly old-fashioned way to say "glowing" or "radiant." Some things are literally aglow, like the sunshine glinting off the surface of a lake, and others are figuratively aglow, like your sister's smiling face, aglow with health and happiness. The poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge is credited with the first use of <i>aglow</i>, in his 1817 "Sonnet to William Wordsworth."</p></div>`;
