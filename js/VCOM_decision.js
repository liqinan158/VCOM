To act with <i>decision</i> is to proceed with determination, which might be a natural character trait.</p><p class="long"><i>Decision</i> originally comes from the Latin <i>decidere</i> ("determine"). You make decisions every day: what to wear, what to eat, how to spend your money, who to vote for, what movie to go to. A court judge makes a decision in a trial (and actually "hands down" or "announces" that decision). If judges make the decision in a boxing match, the winner wins "by decision." More loosely, <i>decision</i> can also refer to the outcome of any game or contest.</p></div>`;
