You might go to the <i>gym</i> to pump iron, or you might go to the <i>gym</i> to see who else is pumping iron.</p><p class="long">The word <i>gym</i> is a shortened form of <i>gymnasium</i>, originally a Latin word meaning "school for gymnastics," from the Greek <i>gymnasion</i>, "public place where exercises are practiced." The preferred way to dress at a gym these days is in shorts or sweatpants, but back in Ancient Greece, men commonly exercised naked â€” hence the root <i>gymnazein</i>, "to train naked."</p></div></div>`;
