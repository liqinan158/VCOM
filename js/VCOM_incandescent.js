You could also describe a brilliant and moving novel as incandescent.</p><p class="long"><i>Incandescent</i>, like the word candle, has its origins in the Latin word <i>candere</i> meaning "to glow or shine." Combined with the suffix <i>in</i> meaning "within," its meaning can be easily pulled from the combination of its root words: "to glow or shine from within." Fire crackers are incandescent because they give off brilliant lights when heated, but look up at a blazing fireworks display, and you'll find it's quite moving, or incandescent with intensity and brilliance.</p></div></div>`;
