It is common in older people, although it can affect anyone, including athletes who've injured knees, ankles, and hips.</p><p class="long">There are said to be more than 100 types of arthritis. It can be a side-effect of aging; typically your cartilage — the tissue that acts as a padding around the joints — becomes stiffer and wears away. On the other hand, younger people can be affected through infections, injury, or obesity. Doctors do not yet know why some people get arthritis and others don't. Even great athletes like Michael Jordan had to deal with arthritis when they got older: it's common.</p></div></div>`;
