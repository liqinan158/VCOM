People being questioned by reporters should try to answer articulately â€” they shouldn't just <i>maunder</i> in response.</p><p class="long">The difference between a great speech and an interminably boring one is that a good speaker keeps it short (and often funny), but a bad one tends to maunder in a mumbling voice. A novelist who tends to have her characters maunder on endlessly needs a skilled editor. Although <i>maunder</i> sometimes also means "wander aimlessly," it doesn't come from the similar <i>meander</i> but probably from a root meaning "to beg."</p></div>`;
