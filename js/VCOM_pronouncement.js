It’s formal and comes from someone in charge. The mayor of your town might make a <i>pronouncement</i> about the importance of not littering.</p><p class="long">When you make a pronouncement, you're certain about what you're saying and say it with authority. A school principal's pronouncement about not running in the halls might be broadcast over the intercom so everyone can hear it. A big brother might make a pronouncement about what’s for dinner. Feel free to ignore him, but not the principal or the mayor, unless you want to get in trouble. <i>Pronouncement</i> comes from the Latin word <i>pronuntiare</i>, "to proclaim or announce."</p></div>`;
