Another kind of <i>tuner</i> is used to adjust the pitch of a musical instrument.</p><p class="long">One kind of tuner can receive digital signals so you can watch television, and another kind is built into your car radio. A person can be a tuner too, such as an expert who makes adjustments to a piano's strings until the pitch is correct.
