If you have, you have made a <i>collage</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Collage</i> came to English through French from the Greek word for glue, <i>kolla</i>, about 100 years ago. A collage is not only made from magazine pictures. In the world of fine art, it refers to a work made with various small objects sometimes with paint sometimes without. The word can also be used to mean a collection of different things. If it's very loud in your house, you might come home to a collage of sounds from the dog, the TV, your mom on the phone and your brother on the guitar. Years after you graduate, high school might just seem like a collage of memories.</p></div>`;
