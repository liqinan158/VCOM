A lot of your junk mail is addressed "To <i>occupant</i>" because the sender doesn't know who lives at your address.</p><p class="long">Being an occupant means you're occupying a place. This has nothing to do with owning a house or renting an apartment; if you live there, you're an occupant. There are other occupants too, as in politics. The President is often called "the current <i>occupant</i> of the White House," who replaced the former occupant. That kind of occupant has as much to do with politics as living space.</p></div></div>`;
