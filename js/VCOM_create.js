Bakers <i>create</i> cakes, ants <i>create</i> problems at picnics, and you probably <i>created</i> a few imaginary friends when you were little.</p><p class="long">Similar to <i>conceive</i> and <i>spawn</i> and the exact opposite of <i>destroy</i>, create is a word that often implies a little bit of imagination. In fact, it takes a lot of creativity to create something spectacular; that is, unless you're a robot, and then your creations occur automatically. Or Mother Nature, where creation just happens naturally: Birds create nests, the tides create waves, and snowstorms create days off from school.</p></div></div>`;
