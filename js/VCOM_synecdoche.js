If your parents buy you a car and you say that you just got a new set of wheels, you're using <i>synecdoche</i> â€” you're using the wheels, which are part of a car, to refer to the whole car.</p><p class="long">To correctly pronounce <i>synecdoche</i>, say "sih-NECK-duh-key." A synecdoche is a part that represents the whole. A photograph of a car that is completely covered in snow is a synecdoche for the burden everyone faces following a big winter storm. Synecdoche is a great literary device, especially for poets who strive to express a great deal in a single image.</p></div>`;
