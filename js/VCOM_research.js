And if you believe that, you need to do more <i>research</i> on the habits of teenagers.</p><p class="long"><i>Research</i> comes from the Old French word <i>recercher</i>, meaning "seek out," or "search closely." When you do research, you are searching for knowledge and facts. Although you write plenty of research papers in college, on anything from the Industrial Revolution to the meaning behind a fur-lined teacup, the term is often used when talking about science, because scientists use step-by-step research to prove what is true, or not true, in their line of work.</p></div>`;
