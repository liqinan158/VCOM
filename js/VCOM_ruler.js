If you're a queen, a sultan, or a czar, you're a <i>ruler</i>.</p><p class="long">Besides "person who rules or governs," you can define <i>ruler</i> as a measuring device that's marked with inches or centimeters. You can measure the diameter of a circle with a ruler, and you can also draw a perfectly straight line using its edge. Both meanings stem from the verb <i>rule</i>, "to exercise power" or "to control," which came to also mean "mark with lines" in the 1590s.</p></div></div>`;
