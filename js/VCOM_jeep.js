Many military vehicles are <i>jeeps</i>.</p><p class="long">Jeeps were originally developed for use on Army bases â€” they're hardy little cars with four-wheel drive that can handle rough terrain. A jeep is sometimes called a "light utility vehicle." It's quicker and smaller than a truck or larger utility vehicle, and most jeeps are now owned by civilians. If the word is capitalized, it's the specific, trademarked brand of cars. <i>Jeep</i> was originally Army slang from the 1940s, a blending of <i>G.P.</i>, or "general purpose vehicle."</p></div></div>`;
