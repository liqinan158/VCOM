A long-running feud between neighbors about a flock of chickens and a barking dog might eventually end up as a <i>lawsuit</i>.</p><p class="long">If someone files a lawsuit against you, you become a defendant, while they are the plaintiff. Lawsuits are always part of civil law, rather than criminal cases, involving something some kind of financial or personal loss. When you're embroiled in a lawsuit, you'll probably need to hire a lawyer. This legal term dates from the 17th century.</p></div>`;
