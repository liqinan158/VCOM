A neighbor who's used to the tidy <i>outside</i> of your house might be shocked by the mess inside.</p><p class="long">Your perfect chocolate chip cookies might be crunchy on the outside, but soft inside, and when your friends eat them, they'll look as happy on the outside as they feel inside. <i>Outside</i> is also an adjective, for talking about the outside temperature or your outside lights that automatically turn on at dusk. If you're on the outside of some group, you don't feel like you belong, and if someone talks about "an <i>outside</i> chance," they mean a very unlikely possibility.</p></div></div>`;
