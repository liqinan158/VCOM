Your grandmother might make it a habit never to go to bed without a <i>cup</i> of warm milk.</p><p class="long">A cup is like a small bowl with a handle. It's also a unit of measurement in cooking â€” if a recipe calls for a cup of water, it's the same as eight ounces. If you <i>cup</i> your hands, you form them into a cup shape, which you do when you hold a baby bird or cup your hand to whisper to your friend. If you say, "Polka music's not my <i>cup</i> of tea," it means you don't love it.</p></div>`;
