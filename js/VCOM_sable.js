It’s native to Japan, Siberia, and other parts of northern Asia. You may meet up with a <i>sable</i> in a zoo or as somebody's expensive coat.</p><p class="long"><i>Sable</i> is a kind of marten — the same family as skunks, wolverines, and minks. The scientific name is Martes zibellina. The word <i>sable</i>, from Russian, likely came into Western European languages in the Middle Ages, when trappers traveled far and wide in search of furry creatures whose skins were worthy to warm the backs of emperors, kings, queens, and Byzantine priests. <i>Sable</i> can also mean "dark black," or it can refer to the hairs of an artist's paintbrush.</p></div></div>`;
