It usually refers to rooms together, like when you get a <i>suite</i> at a fancy hotel. It can also be a set of furniture or a musical composition.</p><p class="long">In housing terms, a <i>suite</i> is an apartment made up of connected rooms. If you ever stay at a hostel in France, make sure you get a room with the bathroom <i>en suite</i>, so you donâ€™t have to share the one in the hallway. When the word first came into use, it meant "train of followers of attendants," but don't call your friends your suite or they'll think you're a snob.</p></div></div>`;
