We can use this word to describe people themselves, or what they say or do at a given moment.</p><p class="long">You probably know that the Latin prefix <i>pre-</i> means "before," so you might be able to figure out that the word <i>prescient,</i> from the verb <i>praescire,</i> means to "know beforehand." People like economists, sports commentators, and political analysts often get tagged with this word, because it's part of their job to sift through the data and make predictions â€” and sometimes they get it right. And when they're not just lucky, we might say they're prescient.</p></div></div>`;
