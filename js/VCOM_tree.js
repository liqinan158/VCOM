If you have an apple <i>tree</i> in your backyard, you'll have apples in the fall â€” and a nice shady place to sit in the summer.</p><p class="long">The thick, woody trunk is actually the stem of a tree, and its ability to grow so much taller than other plants evolved partly as a way for trees to absorb more sunlight. Trees do a lot for humans, including providing oxygen, giving us places to climb, producing fruit, shading us, and providing lumber and fuel. As a verb, <i>tree</i> means "chase into a tree," the way your dog might tree the neighbor's cat.</p></div></div>`;
