You might see an <i>alligator</i> if you travel to Florida or Louisiana.</p><p class="long">Alligators are only found in the warmest, swampiest places in the United States and China — and occasionally in the zoo. They can grow as long as fourteen feet and can weigh more than 900 pounds, and they eat turtles, birds, fish, and sometimes deer. <i>Alligator</i> comes from the Spanish <i>el lagarto</i>, or "lizard." In the 1930s, if someone called you an <i>alligator</i>, they might have been referring to your love for swing music.</p></div></div>`;
