Like <i>registering</i> your car with the DMV and <i>registering</i> for classes at the beginning of a semester.</p><p class="long">Someone needs to register all the ways you can use the word <i>register</i>: As a noun it means the actual book that you record things in. But a register is also the range of sound your voice can make, and that thing the checkout lady uses to ring up your grocery bill. As a verb, register means to mark down officially or sign up, but also to show emotion: if cats and dogs rain from the sky, your face will likely register a look of disbelief.</p></div>`;
