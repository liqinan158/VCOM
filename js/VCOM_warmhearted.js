It would be a <i>warmhearted</i> gesture if you shared your lunch with the kid who's always forgetting to bring hers.</p><p class="long">This adjective was first used around 1500, and it's a close relation to <i>kindhearted</i>. When <i>warm</i> is used to describe feelings, it means "expressing affection or kindness." So whenever someone acts out of tenderness or good will, as if their heart were full of kindness, they're warmhearted. A warmhearted bus driver gives each passenger a genuine smile, and a warmhearted story leaves you feeling content and happy.</p></div></div>`;
