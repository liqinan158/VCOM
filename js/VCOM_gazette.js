In fact, many English-language newspapers from coast-to-coast include the name <i>gazette</i> in their title, from <i>The Daily Hampshire Gazette</i> in Massachusetts to the <i>Mariposa Gazette</i> in California.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>gazette</i> comes from the Italian word <i>gazzetta</i>. In the 1600s, there was a Venetian news sheet that became known as a <i>gazeta</i> because it cost a <i>gazeta</i>, a small-valued Venetian coin. Other experts suggest that the word comes from <i>gazza</i>, a kind of bird — specifically a chattering magpie — that would spread news. A related word is <i>gazetteer</i>, which is a dictionary of geographical names.</p></div>`;
