Usually, it describes something a government body does: when a congress or parliament <i>prorogues</i>, it's putting off business for a while.</p><p class="long"><i>Prorogue</i> comes from the Latin word <i>prorogare</i> meaning "to stretch out." When you stop a meeting and decide to meet again at a later time,  this "stretches out" the work being done. Remember that <i>prorogue</i> is close to <i>prolong</i>, which means pretty much the same thing, but without a break.</p></div>`;
