When your formerly long-haired friend shows up at work with a crew cut, you could say that she looks <i>radically</i> different.</p><p class="long">Use <i>radically</i> to describe things that are done in a big way, particularly a change or an extreme position. For example, the government in your state might change radically after an important election. You'll often see the phrase "<i>radically</i> different" used to mean a change that's enormous, possibly even transforming. Though the root of <i>radically</i>, <i>radical</i>, originally meant "root of a word," it came to mean "far-reaching, innovative, or extreme," especially when it describes political views.</p></div>`;
