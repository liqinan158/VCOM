Back in the days when executioners would routinely gibbet criminals in the public square, the bodies were often left on display â€” possibly to intimidate other potential criminals. The word <i>gibbet</i> has its root in the Old French <i>gibet</i>, "bent stick or gallows," from <i>gibe</i>, or "club."</p></div>`;
