In more temperate regions, you might see lichen and moss growing on dead trees and guess they're responsible for killing their host â€” but these epiphytes simply take advantage of the increased sunlight and physical support of the bare trunks. You can grow an epiphyte of your own, too, by buying a tiny "air plant."</p></div>`;
