There are some <i>roads</i> that are so long, you can follow them from one coast of the U.S. to the other.</p><p class="long">While some roads can be traveled by pedestrians, the word usually specifies a thoroughfare for vehicles, especially cars, trucks, and buses. The longest road in the United States is U.S. Route 20, which stretches from Oregon to Massachusetts. Figuratively, a road can also be a means to an end, or the way to achieve a certain result: "She's on the <i>road</i> to success!" or "He wasn't feeling well yesterday, but now he's on the <i>road</i> to recovery."</p></div></div>`;
