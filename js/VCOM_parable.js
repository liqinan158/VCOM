The <i>parable</i> of the Good Samaritan and the <i>parable</i> of the Prodigal Son are just two examples of the many <i>parables</i> attributed to Jesus, as recorded in the four gospels.</p><p class="long"><i>Parable</i> descends from the Greek <i>parabolē</i>, "a comparison, analogy," from <i>paraballein</i>, "to compare," from the prefix <i>para-</i>, "beside," plus <i>ballein</i>, "to throw." The sense of comparing, or throwing an idea beside another, is at the heart of the word. When you hear a parable, you're meant to use the comparison to learn how to act — the fox's "sour grapes" are compared to your own downgrading of the thing you cannot have.</p></div></div>`;
