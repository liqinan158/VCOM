If begging doesn't convince your parents to raise your allowance, you might want to try a different <i>tactic</i>â€”like doing all your chores without being asked.</p><p class="long">English-speakers have been talking about <i>tactics</i> since at least 1640, when this word was first recorded.

Generals have to have a good grasp on military tactics to win a battle; football teams have to use strong defensive tactics to keep the other guys from scoring.
