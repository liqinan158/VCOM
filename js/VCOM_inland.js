If you were born and grew up in Kansas, you're familiar with <i>inland</i> living.</p><p class="long">The opposite of <i>inland</i> is <i>coastal</i>. When you travel to the rocky coast of Maine or the soft sandy beaches of Florida, you're far from being inland â€” you return to your inland home town when you fly back to Gary, Indiana. <i>Inland</i> comes from the Old English <i>inn lond</i>, "land around the mansion of an estate," and it began to mean "land far from the coast" in the 16th century.</p></div></div>`;
