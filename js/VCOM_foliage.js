"Don't eat the <i>foliage</i> on the rhubarb plant because the leaves are poisonous and eating them can be fatal; the stems, on the other hand, are tasty."</p><p class="long">The noun <i>foliage</i> refers to leaves â€” either individual leaves or the collective leafy canopy of many trees or plants. Every autumn, thousands of people drive through the New England countryside to view the fall foliage, enjoying the brilliant russet and gold leaves against a crisp blue sky. The jungle foliage, on the other hand, can be so dense that one may have to slice through it with a machete in order to pass through it.</p></div>`;
