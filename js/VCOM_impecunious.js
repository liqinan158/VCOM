Then maybe you could make some money teaching vocabulary words.</p><p class="long"><i>Impecunious</i> comes from the old Latin word for money, <i>pecunia</i>, combined with the prefix <i>im</i>, meaning not or without. But <i>impecunious</i> doesnâ€™t just mean having no money. It means that you almost never have any money. If you go into the arts, you are most likely facing an impecunious future. If you gamble away your cash instead of saving it for rent, your landlord might throw you out for being impecunious.</p></div>`;
