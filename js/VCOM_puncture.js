Stick a pin in a balloon and you'll not only make kids cry, you'll also <i>puncture</i> the balloon.</p><p class="long">Use the verb <i>puncture</i> to describe poking a sharp object into something. You can call the hole you've made a puncture as well: get a big enough puncture in your car tire and you'll need to call for help. In Latin, <i>punctus</i> means "to prick or pierce." The hardest thing about <i>puncture</i> is knowing how to spell it â€” remember that there's a <i>c</i> in the middle, and you'll probably get it right.</p></div></div>`;
