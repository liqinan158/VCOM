Or, more likely, he might be dinner for a bigger fish.</p><p class="long">Lakes, seas, and oceans are full of plankton, most of which is so small it can't be seen without a microscope. Anything that floats near the surface is considered to be plankton, whether it's an animal, plant, or something smaller like bacteria, and it's one source of food for fish and whales. The Greek root, <i>planktos</i>, means "wandering or drifting."</p></div></div>`;
