If you fall <i>overboard</i>, don't forget your life vest!</p><p class="long">The adverb <i>overboard</i> most often comes up when someone falls in the water. When it's used literally, it very specifically refers to the movement of a person or an object from a boat into the ocean or other body of water. Figuratively, to go <i>overboard</i> means to take something too far â€” you're going overboard on your diet if you refuse to eat anything that isn't green.</p></div>`;
