If you want to write the epic history of your family, you'll have to be very diligent in tracking down and interviewing all of your relatives.</p><p class="long"><i>Diligent</i> comes from the Latin <i>diligere</i>, which means "to value highly, take delight in," but in English it has always meant careful and hard-working. If you're a diligent worker, you don't just bang away at your job; you earnestly try to do everything right. Although being lucky and talented doesn't hurt, it's the diligent person who eventually succeeds.</p></div>`;
