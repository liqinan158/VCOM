If you study physics, you'll learn about the <i>diffraction</i> of light waves.</p><p class="long">Any kind of wave can experience diffraction, including sound, radio, and water. It's most common to hear about the diffraction of light, which can be seen in the reflection of an image through a pinhole camera or the bright ring of light around the sun or the moon. The root of <i>diffraction</i> is the Latin word <i>diffringere</i>, "break into pieces," from <i>dis</i>, "apart," and <i>frangere</i>, "to break."</p></div>`;
