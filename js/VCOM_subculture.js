They might share religious or political beliefs or be science fiction fans, for example.</p><p class="long">A culture is how people live, sometimes based on where they live â€” you can refer to American culture, Canadian culture, or to an Australian culture. Within these larger cultures, there are also subcultures of many sizes. The Native American community is a subculture, as is the Mormon community. Also, subcultures can be based on interests, like "Deadheads" who used to follow around the rock band "The Grateful Dead." Before 1936, the word <i>subculture</i> was only used by scientists to talk about bacterial cultures.</p></div></div>`;
