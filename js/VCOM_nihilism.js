In philosophy, <i>nihilism</i> is the complete rejection of moral values and religious beliefs.</p><p class="long">It is such a negative outlook that it denies any meaning or purpose in life. In political theory, <i>nihilism</i> is carried to an even greater extreme, arguing for the destruction of all existing political and social institutions. The term <i>nihilism</i> was borrowed from German <i>Nihilismus,</i> since the doctrine was developed by the German philosopher Friedrich Jacobi. The German word is formed from Latin <i>nihil</i> "nothing" plus the suffix â€“<i>ismus</i> "a doctrine or theory."</p></div>`;
