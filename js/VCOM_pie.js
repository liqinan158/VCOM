If your favorite kind of <i>pie</i> is apple, you might order it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.</p><p class="long">Most pie is sweet, but there are also meat and vegetable pies, often called "pot <i>pies</i>." Like dessert pies, these savory dishes are often topped with pastry. Other pies have a bottom crust and an open top, while some have both a top and bottom pastry crust. If something is described as "easy as <i>pie</i>," it's very easy â€” though it's arguable whether it's really all that easy to make a pie.</p></div>`;
