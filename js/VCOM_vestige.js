A lump of snow with a carrot in it might be the <i>vestige</i> of a snowman.</p><p class="long"><i>Vestige</i> derives from the Latin <i>vestigium</i>, "footprint," and that is a good way to think of it â€” as a little hint of what was there before. It's something left behind, like a puddle after a heavy rainstorm. Sometimes <i>vestige</i> is used to emphasize a small amount; for example, you might say that the robber didn't show even a vestige of remorse after he was caught.</p></div>`;
