Weekends are best when you can <i>freely</i> choose when to wake up and what to do with your days.</p><p class="long">Many people spend their childhoods yearning to be older so they can freely live their lives. On a smaller scale, if you let your backyard chickens roam unchecked around your property, they can move freely; and if you ice skate on a lake instead of a small indoor rink, you can move freely, in any direction, without being scolded. <i>Freely</i> comes from <i>free</i>, with its Old English root <i>freo</i>, "acting of one's own will."</p></div>`;
