var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">homonym</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Can you spot the homonyms in the sentence "The baseball pitcher drank a pitcher of water"? A <i>homonym</i> is a word that is said or spelled the same way as another word but has a different meaning. "Write” and “right” is a good example of a pair of <i>homonyms</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Homonym</i> traces back to the Greek words <i>homos</i>, meaning “same,” and <i>onuma</i>, meaning “name.” So a homonym is sort of like two people who have the same name: called the same thing but different. A homonym can be a word that sounds the same as something else — like <i>by</i> (“near”) and <i>buy</i> (“purchase”) — or it can be spelled exactly the same way and pronounced differently — like <i>minute</i> (unit of time) and <i>minute</i> (“tiny”).</p></div>`;
