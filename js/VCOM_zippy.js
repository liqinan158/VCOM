var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">zippy</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Zippy</i> can mean speedy, or bright and spirited. You may wake up in a <i>zippy</i> mood, full of energy, and jump in your <i>zippy</i> little car so you can get to school early.</p><p class="long">When an object is zippy, it moves fast or energetically, like the zippy robotic vacuum cleaner that regularly terrifies your cat. And when people are zippy, they're spirited, like a zippy dance troupe. Language can be zippy too â€” think of wisecracking dialog or clever wordplay. This informal adjective comes from <i>zip</i>, "the sound of something moving rapidly."</p></div></div>`;
