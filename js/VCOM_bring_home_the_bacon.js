You might <i>bring home the bacon</i> by working nights at a warehouse and as a school crossing guard by day.</p><p class="long">There are a lot of guesses about the origin of this phrase, some of them going back to twelfth century England and various traditions and sayings involving bacon. However, to <i>bring home the bacon</i> seems to be a much more recent idiom. The mother of American boxer Joe Gans, in a 1906 telegram in which she urged her son to win a difficult match, made the first recorded use of <i>bring home the bacon</i>, encouraging him to do just that.</p></div>`;
