For example, the <i>greatest common factor</i> of 12 and 30 is 6.</p><p class="long">You can also call the greatest common factor the greatest common divisor. To find it, you first need to break numbers down into their factors (smaller numbers that multiply together to get the original number). Then you can compare all the factors and see if your numbers share any in common â€” if they do, choose the largest of these, and you've got your greatest common factor. For numbers that don't share another divisor, the greatest common factor is 1.</p></div></div>`;
