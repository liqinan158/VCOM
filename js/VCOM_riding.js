So when your friend invites you to go <i>riding</i>, you'd better be prepared to climb up into a saddle.</p><p class="long">You can also call this sport <i>horseback riding</i>, or if you want to get really fancy, <i>equestrianism</i>. Riding involves, of course, staying perched on the back of a horse while it trots, canters, or gallops along. There are a lot of additional variations on riding, including horse racing, rodeo events, and dressage, which involves dance-like movements that are judged on how athletic and graceful the horse is and how relaxed the rider appears.</p></div></div>`;
