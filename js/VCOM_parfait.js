If you order a <i>parfait</i> at your favorite ice cream shop, it may have layers of ice cream, fruit sauce, and whipped cream. Yum!</p><p class="long">The parfait originated in France around 1890, where it was conceived as a frozen custard made by boiling eggs, sugar, and cream. In French, the word appropriately means "perfect." Over the years since, the parfait has been reimagined as a layered dessert served in a clear glass. Ingredients usually include ice cream or whipped cream, although healthier versions might feature yogurt, granola, and fruit. Tasty, sure â€” but is it perfect?</p></div></div>`;
