It comes from the combination of the Italian words for "light" and "dark."</p><p class="long">Nowadays <i>chiaroscuro</i> applies to a far wider array of dramatic lighting effects, particularly in movies — anything dark and moody with great slashes of shadow, is very <i>chiaroscuro.</i> Film Noir, of all the film genres, is the best example of <i>chiaroscuro</i>. <i>Chiaroscuro</i> remains essentially a technical word, though, and is not often used in everyday conversation — unless you happen to be a film critic of course.</p></div></div>`;
