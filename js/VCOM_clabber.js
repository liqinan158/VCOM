It may sound gross, but <i>clabber</i> is edible.</p><p class="long">This noun for naturally clotted milk has all but vanished from modern English — perhaps a victim of home refrigerators and supermarket shopping. It's the only English descendant of Irish <i>claba</i>, which means "thick." Clabber is certainly thick, and it's also quite chunky. The milk part — in the form of the Irish word <i>bainne</i> — was present in an earlier form of the term, <i>bonnie-clabber</i>. Clabber often consists of buttermilk, and it has frequently been a breakfast food.</p></div>`;
