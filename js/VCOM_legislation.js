Some people think there should be more <i>legislation</i> in the area of education and some people think there should be less â€” governments debate the matter periodically.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>legislation</i> refers to the actual law enacted by a legislative body at the national, state, or local level. There has been some very odd legislation over the years. In one state it was illegal to kiss on a train; in another, it was illegal to take a bath on Sunday.
