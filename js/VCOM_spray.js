It describes the medicine you use to make your nose less dry or the air freshener you use to make your bathroom less smelly.</p><p class="long">Though <i>spray</i> has had several incarnations, it is helpful to remember the German root <i>sprühen</i> — “to sparkle” or “to drizzle.” <i>Spray</i> has more than one sense, and can be a verb or a noun: If a whale were to spray you with water, you would be covered in spray. The word can also describe a group of small objects or pieces sent in the air, as in the spray of broken glass caused by your foul ball hitting a window.</p></div></div>`;
