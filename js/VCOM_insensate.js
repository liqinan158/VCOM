Cars, computers, and stuffed animals are all <i>insensate</i> (though some of us occasionally project thoughts and personalities onto them).</p><p class="long"><i>Insensate</i> can also describe individuals who seem to lack the characteristically human emotions of kindness and generosity. A person who tears a stuffed animal out of the hands of a young child might be described as <i>insensate</i>. Another meaning of <i>insensate</i> is “lacking intelligence.” In short, <i>insensate</i>, in any sense of the word, is usually something that you don’t want to be.</p></div>`;
