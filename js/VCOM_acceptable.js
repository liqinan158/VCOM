var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">acceptable</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Something that is <i>acceptable</i> is satisfactory or proper for whatever purpose it is considered; it may not be all that’s hoped for, but it's at least adequate. A grade of “A” is best, but is a grade of "C" <i>acceptable</i>?  It depends on whom you ask.</p><p class="long">The word <i>acceptable</i> means "able to accept," a word that comes from the Latin <i>acceptare</i>, which meant "to take willingly."  Although the word <i>acceptable</i> suggests something that is fine, it sometimes suggests the least that would be sufficient, and can carry a somewhat negative connotation, as was the case when Franz Kafka wrote, "Start with what is right rather than what is acceptable."</p></div>`;
