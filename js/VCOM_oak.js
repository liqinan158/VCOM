If you get hit on the head with an acorn, you are probably standing under an <i>oak</i>.</p><p class="long">There are many species of oaks, a few of which are evergreen, keeping their leaves all year, but most have bright leaves in the fall and are bare for the winter months. An oak table or oak desk is made from the sturdy wood of an oak tree. The strength of oaks has inspired several countries to adopt them as symbols on money and flags, and in 2004 the oak was voted the national tree by the US Congress.</p></div>`;
