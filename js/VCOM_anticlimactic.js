An <i>anticlimactic</i> fireworks display would be brief and boring, with subdued pops of muted sparkles.</p><p class="long">The Greek root of <i>anticlimactic</i> means "down a ladder," and that's exactly how it feels to experience something anticlimactic, as if you expected to go higher but you're suddenly near the bottom of the ladder. In a scary movie, as the hero moves closer to the creepy basement door while terrifying music plays, it will be a bit anticlimactic if the door swings open to reveal a mewing kitten.</p></div>`;
