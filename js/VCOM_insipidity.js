The <i>insipidity</i> of the book you're reading for English class might make it hard to finish it in time.</p><p class="long">You might complain about the insipidity of your dreary hotel room, or the insipidity of every single TV show as you flip from channel to channel. The insipidity of pop music could inspire you to write your own songs, and the insipidity of your mom's casserole might call for liberal amounts of ketchup. <i>Insipidity</i> comes from <i>insipid</i>, or dull, which originally meant "without flavor," from the Late Latin <i>inspidus</i>, "tasteless."</p></div></div>`;
