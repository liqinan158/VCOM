You might say that you'd love to live in New York City, but it's <i>awfully</i> expensive.</p><p class="long">The word <i>awfully</i> is most often used for emphasis, as a way to say "extremely," "immensely," or "highly." Your newborn nephew might be awfully cute, or your surprise birthday party might be awfully fun. You can also use the word to mean "dreadfully" or "terribly," as in "My team played just <i>awfully</i>, so I wasn't surprised when they lost the game." The original meaning was "inspiring awe" or "inspiring reverence."</p></div>`;
