Honeycomb is made of <i>beeswax</i> filled with honey.</p><p class="long">If you've ever chewed a piece of honeycomb, you've tasted beeswax. The sweetness comes from the honey, but the waxy, chewable substance is the wax that's produced by bees so they can construct the honeycomb. Humans use beeswax for many products, from lip balm to furniture polish. When you ask your sister a question and she says, "That's none of your <i>beeswax</i>!" she means it's not your business or concern.</p></div>`;
