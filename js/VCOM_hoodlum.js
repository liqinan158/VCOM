A car full of <i>hoodlums</i> might drive down the street and smash mailboxes with a baseball bat. <i>Hoodlums</i> are into mean stuff like that.</p><p class="long">If you've ever seen a group of young people who look like trouble, you may have seen a group of hoodlums. Hoodlums are loud, aggressive, and violent. Hoodlums are part of gangs and commit crimes. If a young person robs a store or mugs someone, heâ€™s a hoodlum. The word <i>hoodlum</i> has nothing to do with the hood on a sweatshirt. A hoodlum can also be called a gangster, thug, or toughie. Steer clear!</p></div>`;
