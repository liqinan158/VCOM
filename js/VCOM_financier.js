A <i>financier</i> is the high-profile star of a company and the envy of the overworked entry-level workers.</p><p class="long">The suffix <i>-ier</i> in <i>financier</i> tells you that this word refers to a person who has something to do with finance. But where does the word <i>finance</i> come from? Long ago, it meant "to settle or end a debt," which you can see in <i>fin</i>, the Old French word for "end." But as financial work evolved, it came to also encompass taxation and revenue, not just debt collection.</p></div>`;
