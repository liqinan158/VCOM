An <i>astringent</i> personality, on the other hand, is perceived as bitter and perhaps even a bit toxic.</p><p class="long">Astringent may be a lifesaver for an acne-prone teen, but when the term is used as an adjective and applied to you personally, it's less positive. Since astringents are acid-based, an astringent personality can also be corrosive. If someone is prone to biting sarcasm and cynicism, he probably has an astringent view of the world.</p></div></div>`;
