var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">unreliable</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Someone <i>unreliable</i> can't be trusted to do something. Things can be <i>unreliable</i> too, like a bike with a wobbly wheel.</p><p class="long">The word "rely" is a clue to what <i>unreliable</i> means. When you can rely on something, you can count in it â€” it's reliable. On the other hand, you'd better not count on an unreliable person. People can be unreliable because they're dishonest, always late, bad at their job, or just inconsistent. Things can be unreliable because they're broken or old. A train schedule can be unreliable if the trains are never on time. Unfortunately, there's a lot of stuff in life that's unreliable, so be careful.</p></div>`;
