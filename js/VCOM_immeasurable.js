If something is immeasurable, then measuring is impossible. The numbers of stars in the sky is immeasurable: we can't know how many there are. The number of grains of sand on a beach is immeasurable: they canâ€™t be counted. This word means more than a lot. There are a lot of countries in the world, but they're not immeasurable.</p></div></div>`;
