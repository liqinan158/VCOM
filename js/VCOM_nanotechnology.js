If that sounds small, it certainly is: a nanometer is a billionth of a meter. When scientists are working at this level, they are dealing with atoms and molecules. Science fiction has featured tiny creatures such as nanobots, but the real world of nanotechnology increasingly includes breakthroughs in the areas of energy, vaccines, computers, and food production.</p></div>`;
