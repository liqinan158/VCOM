A bully's <i>maliciousness</i> may cause him to push smaller kids off the swings and laugh. Not nice!</p><p class="long">Thankfully, true maliciousness is rare â€” the bad guy in a book or movie is more likely to be motivated by maliciousness than people you meet in real life. Still, if someone acts in a hateful or vindictive way, appearing to enjoy watching others suffer pain or humiliation, that's maliciousness. We can trace this word back to the Latin <i>malitiosus</i>, "wicked," from the root <i>malus</i>, "bad."</p></div></div>`;
