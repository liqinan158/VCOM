Likewise, many home chefs might insist that if you have a really good, sharp knife, other tools like peelers and choppers and food processors are completely dispensable. The earliest definition of this word was "subject to dispensation," from the Latin <i>dispensare</i>, "disburse or distribute," although by the 1640s <i>dispensable</i> meant "that which can be done without."</p></div>`;
