So a weakling who's in charge of a business still has a lot of <i>power</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Power</i> comes from the Latin word <i>potere</i>, which means "to be able." But things with power are much more than able â€” they're able to exert a lot of force. "The powers that be" are those who hold authority, and "the power behind the throne" refers to the people who exert influence without being formally in charge. When used as a verb, <i>power</i> means "to supply with mechanical or electrical energy," as in a nuclear-powered submarine.</p></div>`;
