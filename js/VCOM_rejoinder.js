If someone asks you a silly question like, "Are you painting?" when you are holding a paint can and a brush, your <i>rejoinder</i> could be, "No, I'm just doing my nails."</p><p class="long">The word <i>rejoinder</i> comes from the Middle French word <i>rejoindre</i>, which meant to answer a legal charge.
