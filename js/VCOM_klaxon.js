While the sound of a <i>klaxon</i> is a little old-fashioned these days, its loud blast will still get your attention.</p><p class="long">Most people who attempt to describe the sound of a klaxon come up with something like "AH-OOH-GA," and in fact it's not uncommon to call a klaxon an "ahooga horn." The word <i>klaxon</i> is actually trademarked, describing a specific mechanical horn first made by the Klaxon Company in 1908. The sound of a klaxon was once a common noise on busy streets, at train crossings, and even on boats.</p></div></div>`;
