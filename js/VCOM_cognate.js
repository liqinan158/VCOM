var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">cognate</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you're learning a new language, a <i>cognate</i> is an easy word to remember because it looks and means the same thing as a word you already know. For example, <i>gratitude</i> in English means the same as <i>gratitud</i> in Spanish.</p><p class="long">Just as words that are cognates have a shared origin — like <i>gratitude</i> and <i>gratitud</i> both coming from the Latin word <i>gratitudo</i>, meaning "thankfulness" — people can be cognates based on their shared blood. For example, you and your sister are cognates of your parents. You probably even look alike, just like word cognates. The adjective form of <i>cognate</i> can describe blood relations or anyone whose ancestors spoke the same language.</p></div>`;
