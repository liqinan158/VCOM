If someone makes a snarky comment about your culinary skills, you might call their comments <i>acidulous</i> or bitter.</p><p class="long">In either usage, the word <i>acidulous</i> leaves a sour taste in your mouth, or a pursed expression on your face. You see the word <i>acid</i> in the word, which, in fact, can also be used in both senses. Someone's acid remarks will be just as hurtful as their acidulous ones. Lemons are an acidic fruit, as are most citrus fruits, but lemons are more acidulous than oranges.</p></div>`;
