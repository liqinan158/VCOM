Someone who has just proposed marriage waits in <i>anticipation</i> for a positive reply.</p><p class="long"><i>Anticipation</i> can be a nervous expectation, like when the birthday party waited in anticipation for Elmer to walk in so they could surprise him. However, <i>anticipation</i> can also mean to be like a Boy Scout: prepared. The weather center's anticipation of the storm prevented anyone from getting hurt. It can refer to something you'd like to prevent from happening, such as "the <i>anticipation</i> of a tax increase next year." Either way, it's a way of looking ahead, just like its Latin roots which mean "to take care of ahead of time."</p></div></div>`;
