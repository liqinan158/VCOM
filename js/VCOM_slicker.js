Those dark clouds look ominous. Better grab your <i>slicker</i> before you go!</p><p class="long">Any kind of raincoat can be called a <i>slicker</i>, but it's an especially appropriate term for a waxy, smooth garment that repels drops of rain, like the yellow slickers fishermen often wear. If someone is described as a <i>city slicker</i>, it means that they're sophisticated, accustomed to life in the city, and that they have fancy taste — so don’t ask them to help you milk the cows on your farm.</p></div></div>`;
