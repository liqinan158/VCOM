They find it easy to strike up a conversation, unlike others who may be shy. Being talkative is associated with being friendly. Talkative people can also be described as chatty, garrulous, loquacious, talky, and likely to talk your ear off. If you don’t feel like chatting, you'd better avoid talkative people. The root word of <i>talkative</i> is the Middle English <i>tale</i>, or "story."</p></div></div>`;
