If you have a sweet tooth, you may wish it were the only course of the meal.</p><p class="long">The word <i>dessert</i> originates from an interesting French word, <i>desservir,</i> which actually means "to clear the table." After the dinner dishes are removed, the host brings out the dessert. These days, desserts don't always have to be a sweet course, but can instead be a savory or a cheese course. Other offbeat treats include Vidalia onion ice cream and radish pie.</p></div>`;
