Sometimes the message written in code is itself called a <i>cipher</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Cipher</i> comes from the Arabic <i>sifr</i>, which means "nothing" or "zero." The word came to Europe along with the Arabic numeral system. As early codes substituted numerals for letters to hide the wordâ€™s meaning, codes became known as ciphers. If you crack a cipher, you break the code and can understand the message. From its "zero" meaning, <i>cipher</i> can also be used for a person who has no influence or importance in the world.</p></div></div>`;
