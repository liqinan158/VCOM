You can add <i>presumably</i> to any statement that you think is true â€” it indicates a logical conclusion for which you don't have definite proof.</p><p class="long">When you add <i>presumably</i> to whatever you're saying, you're giving notice that you think what you're saying is true but telling your listener not to ask for the evidence. You might watch beer commercials and say to yourself, "<i>Presumably</i> advertisers think people will find this commercial amusing and want to run out and buy tubs of this beer." The adverb <i>presumably</i> is related to the nouns <i>presumption</i> and <i>assumption</i>, which are also notions you accept without proof.</p></div></div>`;
