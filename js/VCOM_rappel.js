To <i>rappel</i> safely, a climber uses special anchors and climbing ropes, as well as the help of another person.</p><p class="long">Descending is the riskiest part of mountaineering, so many climbers rappel instead of simply climbing down using hand- and footholds. Various tools and equipment can help a climber rappel even more safely, but the most important one is a good rope that's securely anchored. The French <i>rappel</i> literally means "recall." Some English speakers use the term <i>abseil</i> instead.</p></div></div>`;
