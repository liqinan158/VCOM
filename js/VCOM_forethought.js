With some <i>forethought</i>, you can make sure to cook enough food for all the friends you invited to your dinner party.</p><p class="long">People with forethought are good planners: it takes a little forethought to plan a trip to Europe or to make a monthly budget or to interview someone for a newspaper article. Instead of acting impulsively, using forethought means making a strategy or considering different outcomes before taking action. It comes from the obsolete <i>forethink</i>, "think of something beforehand," from Old English, <i>fore√æencan</i>, "to premeditate or consider."</p></div>`;
