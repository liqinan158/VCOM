If you're feeling sleepy, you might need a nap or a walk around the block to <i>reinvigorate</i> you.</p><p class="long"><i>Reinvigorate</i> adds the "again" prefix <i>re-</i> to <i>invigorate</i>, "give energy to." At the heart of both is <i>vigor</i>, "strength and health," which comes from the Latin <i>vigere</i>, "be lively, flourish, or thrive." So if a hot cup of tea or a long talk on the phone with your best friend reinvigorates you, that means it makes you feel strong and lively.</p></div></div>`;
