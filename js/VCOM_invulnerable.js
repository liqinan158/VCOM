Or Mother Theresa's reputation.</p><p class="long">From the Latin <i>invulnerabilis</i>, meaning “not wounding,” came the English <i>invulnerable</i>, an adjective meaning invincible or immune to attack. Some people look to vaccines to make them invulnerable. Others use body armor. Philosopher Henry David Thoreau, on the other hand, relied upon music: “When I hear music, I fear no danger. I am invulnerable."</p></div></div>`;
