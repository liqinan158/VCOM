If you don't even study for your test, you're making a pretty <i>pitiful</i> effort to do well.</p><p class="long">The word <i>pitiful</i> can be used in a range of contexts. Most commonly, you'll see it used as an expression of contempt and pity, the way the word <i>pathetic</i> might be used.  You might also see it used in reference to something unfortunate or deserving of pity â€” like a homeless mother and her child, begging for money on the street. Something pitiful might also be something very small or inadequate.  A pitiful attempt, is one that isn't good enough.</p></div>`;
