You may see a <i>gueridon</i> in the furniture wing of a museum or even your antiques-loving grandfather's house.</p><p class="long">Gueridons were first made in seventeenth century France, and they had intricate, curved columns supporting their round tops. These columns were usually carved with figures inspired by ancient Roman and Greek forms. While gueridons are usually ornate and decorative, their simple purpose was to hold a small object, like a vase or candlestick. The word comes from the French name <i>Gu√©ridon</i>, a fictional character featured in stories and songs in the seventeenth century.</p></div></div>`;
