Contrapuntal music involves counterpoint, in which more than one musical line plays at the same time. The lines are independent but related harmonically: creating that relationship isn’t easy. A contrapuntal composer therefore must be very skilled, because contrapuntal music has a lot of balls in the air — or rather, notes. You can also call contrapuntal music polyphonic.</p></div>`;
