If your dad has something very important to tell you, he might sit you down for a <i>man-to-man</i> conversation.</p><p class="long">You could also describe a man-to-man talk as being "one-on-one" or even "woman-to-woman," since <i>man-to-man</i> obviously excludes anyone who's not male. The term has an implication of extreme honesty: "It might hurt your feelings, but I think it's time for a <i>man-to-man</i> chat about your grades." You can also use <i>man-to-man</i> to mean "player to player," a common sports defense strategy in which every player guards one specific opponent.</p></div></div>`;
