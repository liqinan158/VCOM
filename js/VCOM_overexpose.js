It might look cool and arty, but it’s usually just a washed out mess. Redo!</p><p class="long">A bright, washed out photograph that has no sharp details or clear highlights can be the result when you overexpose it. Another way to overexpose is to leave someone open to too much risk or public attention — a pushy stage parent may overexpose a child actor to the media, for example, in an attempt to make them famous. The photography meaning dates from the invention of photography itself in the nineteenth century.</p></div></div>`;
