That action might be a random or temporary movement, such as someone who is <i>active</i> and exercises only now and then, or something continuous, like an <i>active</i> strain of a virus.</p><p class="long">Since the adjective <i>active</i> suggests activity, applying it to anything implies some sort of motion or action. A person might be physically active, not sitting around and doing nothing, or mentally active, working the mind. In language, we refer to "the <i>active</i> voice" as one in which the subject does the action, in contrast to the passive voice, a rather boring style where the subject is the receiver of the action. Even in writing, itâ€™s better to be active!</p></div></div>`;
