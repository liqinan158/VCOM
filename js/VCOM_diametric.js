It's also used for two things that couldn't be more different from each other.</p><p class="long">Outside of math class, <i>diametric</i> is most commonly used to mean "completely different." So you might say that your sociable, friendly cat is the diametric opposite of your shy dog. Or that your current French teacher, who's solemn and stern, is the diametric opposite of last year's funny, laid-back French teacher. Imagine these diametric opposites standing on opposing sides of a circle. The word comes from <i>diameter</i> and its Greek root <i>diametros</i>, "diagonal of a circle."</p></div>`;
