You and your brothers are the <i>progeny</i> of your parents, and your cat's new litter of kittens is her <i>progeny</i>.</p><p class="long">Synonyms for <i>progeny</i> include <i>descendants</i>, <i>product</i>, and <i>offspring</i>, so you're also your grandparents' and great-grandparents' progeny. And, if your pet goat has babies every spring, you'll get to raise dozens of her progeny. Plants have progeny too â€” blow the fluffy seeds of a dandelion in your yard and its progeny can multiply, summer after summer, until your lawn is full of cheerful yellow flowers.</p></div></div>`;
