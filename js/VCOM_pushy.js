A <i>pushy</i> used car salesperson will make you feel bullied into buying something even if you were just interested in admiring convertibles.</p><p class="long">If you're pushy, you're not afraid to let your ambition show, or to boss other people around. Pushy parents might argue with a teacher who gives their child a bad grade, and pushy newspaper reporters will invade your privacy to get a good story. This adjective was originally used, around 1891, to describe a cow. Just a few years later, it began to describe people as well.</p></div></div>`;
