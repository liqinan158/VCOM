Its most famous use is in the Declaration of Independence, which says people have <i>unalienable</i> rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p><p class="long">To find the origins of the word <i>unalienable</i>, we can look at the root, <i>alien</i>, which comes from the Latin <i>alienus</i>, meaning "of or belonging to another." This provides the basis for our word, with the prefix <i>un-</i> providing the turnaround "not," and the suffix <i>-able</i> providing the idea of capability. Therefore, we get “not able to be denied.” Oh, and if you are wondering about the common argument as to whether it is "<i>un</i>alienable" or "<i>in</i>alienable," either is correct.</p></div></div>`;
