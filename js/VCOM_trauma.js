A car accident can cause physical <i>trauma</i> like broken bones while losing your dog on a walk is an emotional <i>trauma</i>.</p><p class="long">When you think of <i>trauma</i> think of blunt force. Trauma tends to come on all at once and be quite serious. Someone who experiences trauma will have either a traumatic injury or traumatic distress. Try not to use this term lightly. If you say that having to wait twenty minutes for a burger was a trauma, people will rightly accuse you of drama.</p></div></div>`;
