In some cases, people are born without an arm or a foot, and in others they've lost a limb in an accident. Prosthetic limbs can help them get along more easily, substituting for the absent part. <i>Prosthetic</i> has a Greek root, <i>prostithenai</i>, or "addition," and an early meaning of "that which is added to the body."</p></div></div>`;
