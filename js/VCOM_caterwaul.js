If you've ever heard two cats fighting, you know what a <i>caterwaul</i> sounds like.</p><p class="long">While a caterwaul can be made by a person, it's more likely the wailing sound that a distressed or fighting animal makes. To make this sound is to <i>caterwaul</i> â€” it's both a noun and verb. Cats are, in fact, the animal best known to caterwaul, and the word is believed to come from the German <i>katerwaulen</i>, "cry like a cat," or possibly the Middle Dutch <i>cater</i>, "tomcat," and Middle English <i>waul</i>, "yowl."</p></div>`;
