Many Muslims believe that a <i>djinn</i> can take the form of an animal or a human.</p><p class="long">Muslim mythology includes angels and also the spirits known as djinns or <i>jinns</i>, which are described in the Qur'an as being able to interact with people despite being made of a "smokeless fire." Djinns are known for having free will, and for being either good or evil, like humans. The word <i>djinn</i> comes from the Arabic <i>jinn</i>, a plural noun that means both "demons or spirits" and also, literally, "hidden from sight." The word <i>genie</i> shares the same Arabic root.</p></div></div>`;
