A substitute teacher might worry that an unruly classroom will descend into <i>anarchy</i>.</p><p class="long">From the Greek for "without a ruler" we get this word for the political philosophy that the best government is no government at all — a movement that enjoyed surprising success worldwide in the early and middle parts of the twentieth century. Today, the word is more commonly used to describe not a political ideal but a state of total disorder, chaos and even violence: "A type of bloody <i>anarchy</i> is beginning to reign." A good synonym would be "lawlessness."</p></div></div>`;
