The next time you eat at an Indian restaurant, try some <i>samosas</i> as an appetizer.</p><p class="long">While samosas are usually associated with India, there are actually few regions of the world that don't have some version of the savory pastry as part of their cuisine. Many of these samosa relatives, from Tajikistan's <i>sambosa</i> to Somalia's <i>sambuus</i>, share an etymological root, the Persian word <i>sanbosag</i>. The earliest known printed reference to the samosa appeared in 11th-century Persian writing. Today samosas are easy to find  â€” just check out the menu at any Indian restaurant!</p></div></div>`;
