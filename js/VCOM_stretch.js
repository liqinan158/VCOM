You <i>stretched</i> both your vacation and the truth when you called out of work on Monday saying your flight home from Ibiza was canceled.</p><p class="long"><i>Stretch</i> is a word that has many great usages. The sense of extending one’s limbs came about circa 1200. Four hundred years later brought the phrase "<i>stretch</i> your legs," meaning take a walk. Don’t walk too vigorously, though, or you could <i>stretch</i> a muscle. The word can also be used as a noun, meaning an expanse, as in, "Looking toward the horizon, the thirsty man saw an endless <i>stretch</i> of sand."</p></div>`;
