If you <i>baste</i> your Thanksgiving turkey while it bakes, it will stay moist and tender.</p><p class="long">A chef might baste grilled vegetables with their marinade, or baste roasting meat with its own oily drippings. The technique keeps food from drying out as it cooks. Another meaning of <i>baste</i> is "to sew loosely." You might quickly baste the hem of a curtain before stitching it securely in place. The origin of the culinary <i>baste</i> is a bit of a mystery, but the sewing term comes from the Old French <i>bastir</i>, "construct" or "sew up."</p></div>`;
