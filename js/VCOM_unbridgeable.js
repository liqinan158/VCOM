You might describe the unbridgeable communication gap between you and your parents or an unbridgeable difference between how much houses cost in a town and the income of most residents. A river that's too wild or prone to flooding for a bridge to cross it is quite literally unbridgeable, from the verb <i>bridge</i>, "build a bridge over."</p></div></div>`;
