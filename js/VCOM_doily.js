If your mom's birthday breakfast spread doesn't look festive enough, you can dress it up with some <i>doilies</i>.</p><p class="long">Some doilies are made of lace, while paper doilies are patterned and cut to resemble lace. You might see a doily underneath a cake, or separating a cup of fruit from the saucer beneath it. The word <i>doily</i> comes from <i>Doiley</i>, the last name of a well-known London dry goods dealer in the 17th century. Originally, the word was an adjective describing suits or fabric, and later, from <i>doily-napkin</i> came the <i>doily</i> we know today.</p></div></div>`;
