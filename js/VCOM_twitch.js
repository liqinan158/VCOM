Your eye muscles might start to <i>twitch</i> when you're extremely tired.</p><p class="long">Back in the 12th century, instead of using the word <i>twitch</i>, you would've used <i>to-twic-chen</i>, which was defined as "pulling apart with a quick jerk." It stemmed from the Old English <i>twiccian</i>, "to pluck, gather, or catch hold of." Today, we use <i>twitch</i> as a noun too, to mean the jerky spasm itself: "She tried not to laugh, but he could see a twitch in her lip."</p></div></div>`;
