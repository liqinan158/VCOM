To <i>forestall</i> the effects of aging, exercise and take care of your health all your life.</p><p class="long">You can break the word <i>forestall</i> into parts to figure out its meaning. The prefix <i>fore</i> is one you've seen in words like <i>forewarn</i>, which means "to warn in advance." And you probably know that <i>stall</i> means "delay." So to forestall is to stall in advance, or put another way, to try to prevent or put off something you don't want to happen.</p></div>`;
