You could attach a <i>cart</i> to your dog and teach him to pull it around.</p><p class="long">The typical cart is hooked up to a draft horse or another farm animal. Other kinds of carts include hand carts, which can be stacked with heavy items and easily pushed or pulled by people; and golf carts, which are open vehicles that are powered by electricity or gasoline. When you <i>cart</i> something around, you lug it or transport it. The word <i>cart</i> comes from a Scandinavian source, probably the Old Norse <i>kartr</i>.</p></div>`;
