When you <i>strong-arm</i> your sister into getting out of your bedroom, you physically push her out the door.</p><p class="long">Bullies strong-arm smaller kids into handing over their lunch money, and powerful countries strong-arm weaker ones into cooperating with treaties and alliances. In the second example, a figurative kind of strong-arming is going on; there is no physical action, just the implied threat of negative consequences. You can also use this word as an adjective: "Your <i>strong-arm</i> tactics don't scare me!"</p></div>`;
