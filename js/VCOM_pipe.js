When your kitchen <i>pipes</i> get clogged, call a plumber. A <i>pipe</i> is also something to put tobacco in and smoke. Old pictures of Santa show him smoking a <i>pipe</i>.</p><p class="long">Water moves through pipes before it comes flowing out of your faucets. Other substances, like oil and gas, also flow through pipes. These pipes are usually made of metal or a very sturdy kind of plastic. Other kinds of pipes include the ones you make music with and the one your uncle has to smoke outside, because it's so smelly. <i>Pipe</i> comes from the Vulgar Latin <i>pipa</i>, "tube-shaped musical instrument."</p></div></div>`;
