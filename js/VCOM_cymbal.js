Those are the sounds made by a <i>cymbal</i> — a loud percussion instrument that is part of most drum kits.</p><p class="long">One of the most fun parts of being a drummer has to be hitting the cymbals, a crashing, clanging instrument that, as you may have guessed, is very loud. A cymbal is a concave, almost flat, circular piece of brass. Drummers hit the cymbal with a drumstick or bang two cymbals together. If you love peace and quiet, stay away from cymbals — and drummers!</p></div></div>`;
