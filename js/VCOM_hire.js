If you manage your local ice cream shop, it might be part of your job to <i>hire</i> extra ice cream scoopers for the busy summer season.</p><p class="long">Your boss at the animal shelter might hire you immediately if she's desperate for help â€” or if you impress her as a true animal lover. Once she does, she can call you "a new <i>hire</i>," or a recently hired employee. It's less common in the U.S. than in Britain, but you can also say you hire a car when you rent or lease one. <i>Hire</i> comes from the Old English <i>hyr</i>, which means both "wages" and "interest."</p></div>`;
