You could describe your brother as <i>punic</i> if he promises to keep a secret and then immediately tells it to all of his friends at school.</p><p class="long">A punic person is treacherous or two-faced, unlikely to be loyal. You risk being called punic if you're nice to your friend but gossip about her behind her back. The adjective <i>punic</i> is sometimes capitalized, and in that case it means "of or relating to Carthage," which was a famous ancient empire and is still a city in Tunisia today. Because the ancient Romans thought the Carthaginians were traitorous and unreliable, <i>punic</i> came to also have this meaning.</p></div></div>`;
