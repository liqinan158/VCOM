If your teacher expects you to arrive <i>punctually</i>, you'd better get to class before the bell rings!</p><p class="long">People who are always on time are known for doing things punctually. Arriving punctually at the airport means you'll never miss a flight. Finishing your book report punctually means you'll hand it in before the deadline. The adverb <i>punctually</i> comes from <i>punctual</i> and its Latin root <i>punctus</i>, "a pricking." In fact, <i>punctual</i> originally meant "having a sharp point," and evolved to "insisting on fine points" or "prompt."</p></div>`;
