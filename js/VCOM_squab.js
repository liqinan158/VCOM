Most people use the word <i>squab</i> when they're talking about this bird as food.</p><p class="long">If you order squab in a restaurant, you'll be served what looks like a small roasted chicken. The word <i>squab</i> was once used for the meat of any dove or pigeonâ€”including the now-extinct passenger pigeon. In the 17th century, it simply meant "very young bird," but earlier it was used to mean "unformed, lumpish person" or "lumpish mass." The origins of <i>squab</i> are uncertain, but it's probably related to the Swedish <i>skvabb</i>, meaning "loose, fat flesh."</p></div></div>`;
