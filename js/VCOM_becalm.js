When there's no wind at all on a lake, you can say that the weather <i>becalms</i> your sailboat.</p><p class="long">You're most likely to find the verb <i>becalm</i> describing what happens to a sailboat or another vessel with a sail when the air is still and the wind's not blowing. You can also use it to mean "soothe," the way the sound of a familiar voice might becalm a fussy baby. The word dates from about 1550, from <i>be-</i>, "to make," and <i>calm</i>, from the Old French <i>calme</i>, "tranquility."</p></div></div>`;
