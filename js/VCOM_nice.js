var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">nice</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To be <i>nice</i> is to be pleasant and good-natured. Polite people and sunny days are <i>nice</i>.</p><p class="long">Nice people and situations are enjoyable and don't cause problems. If you say something rude (or honest) to your sibling, your parents might say "Be nice!" This word is a little vague and overused. Like <i>interesting</i>, it's hard to know what people really mean when they say <i>nice</i>. One meaning is easier to figure out: if you score a goal in hockey, that was a nice shot. That means you were skillful and did well â€” you shot the puck nicely.</p></div>`;
