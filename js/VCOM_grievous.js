If you have a <i>grievous</i> wound, a band aid simply won't do.</p><p class="long"><i>Grievous</i> is derived from the noun <i>grief</i>, which means "sadness." When something is <i>grievous</i>, therefore, it's not just bad, but so bad that it causes unusually intense shock or sadness. It's often used to describe crimes and other bad deeds that go beyond mere criminality and into the world of cruelty. For example, it's harmful to steal from someone; it's <i>grievous</i> to steal from them and then, having stolen their stuff, beat them up or kill them.</p></div>`;
