No horror movies for you!</p><p class="long">We get <i>squeamish</i> from the Anglo-French word <i>escoimous</i>, meaning disdainful or shy. It can mean shy of blood or gore, or less often, it is used to describe a prissy kind of fear of confrontation with others. How can you become a heart surgeon if you’re squeamish enough to faint every time you get a paper cut? If you’re squeamish about confronting the noisy neighbors, why not slip a note under their door asking them to pipe down?</p></div></div>`;
