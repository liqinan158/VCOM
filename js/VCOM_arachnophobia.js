Your <i>arachnophobia</i> might make you too terrified to venture into basements, attics, and barns — or to read "Charlotte's Web."</p><p class="long">The vast majority of people are at least a little leery of eight-legged creatures, but someone with a true case of arachnophobia will often suffer a panic attack if he sees — or even think about seeing — a spider. The word <i>arachnophobia</i> comes from two roots, <i>arachnid</i>, "spider," from the Greek <i>arakhne</i>, "spider or spider's web," and <i>phobia</i>, "fear," from the Greek <i>phobos</i>.</p></div></div>`;
