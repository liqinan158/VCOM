It's the warm feeling you get when you remember the person who told you to drop your 1980s hairstyle and get with the new millennium already.</p><p class="long">Though they both recognize the instrumental roles others have played in our lives, gratitude is different from indebtedness. <i>Gratitude</i>, which rhymes with "attitude," comes from the Latin word <i>gratus</i>, which means "thankful, pleasing." When you feel gratitude, you're pleased by what someone did for you and also pleased by the results. Unlike indebtedness, you're not anxious about having to pay it back. But it's still great to tell the recipient of your gratitude how much they mean to you.</p></div>`;
