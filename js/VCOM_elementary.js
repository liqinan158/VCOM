That's an earlier, less advanced type of school than middle and high school. Things that are elementary are simpler â€” easy enough for a first grader to handle. A puzzle that's a snap to solve could be called elementary. We can also say that something is elementary when it's a basic building block of something else: a good breakfast is elementary to healthy nutrition, for example.</p></div>`;
