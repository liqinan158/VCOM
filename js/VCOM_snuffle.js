People are most likely to <i>snuffle</i> when they're crying or have a bad cold.</p><p class="long">For some people, spring means warmer weather and pretty flowers, but for others it means their allergies make them snuffle and sneeze continuously. When you see a sad movie in a theater, you'll probably hear people snuffle all around you â€” and if you visit the zoo or a farm, you can watch animals snuffle, or sniff at things. The Old English version of <i>snuffle</i> is <i>snofl</i>, "phlegm or mucus."</p></div></div>`;
