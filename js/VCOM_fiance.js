If you're talking about a woman, you would call her a <i>fiancée</i> rather than a <i>fiancé</i>, which is used only to refer to men. The Latin root of <i>fiancé</i>, which is spelled the same way, means "a promise," so you can think of becoming someone's fiance as a promise you're making to go through with the marriage.</p></div>`;
