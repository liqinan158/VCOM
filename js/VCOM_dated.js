And while some movies are still funny even years after they're released, the jokes in others just seem dated. This word meaning "old-fashioned" has been around since the turn of the 20th century, from <i>date</i>, which means both "to mark with a date" and also "to mark as old-fashioned."</p></div></div>`;
