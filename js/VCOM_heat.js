You can feel a marked difference in air temperature if you hold your hand near the <i>heat</i> of a candle flame, for example.</p><p class="long"><i>Heat</i> can also mean the intensity of an emotion. In the heat of an argument, you need to watch what you say, because you may regret it later. The verb <i>heat</i> means to make something hot, like when you heat up last night's pizza to eat for lunch today. When things <i>heat</i> up, they become exciting or intense, the way thrilling chase scenes heat up your favorite action movie.</p></div></div>`;
