The root of the mandrake has very slight hallucinogenic qualities, and if it's consumed in large quantities it can cause death or coma. Mandrakes are famous in literature and folklore â€” they appear in the Bible, and one story claims that they scream when pulled from the ground, killing the person who harvests them.</p></div>`;
