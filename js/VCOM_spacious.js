A luxury sedan, for example, might be said to have a spacious interior. <i>Spacious</i> can also be used to mean “having an expansive scope.” A spacious novel, for instance, would be a novel that deals with a broad range of characters and issues. Don’t confuse <i>spacious</i> with <i>specious</i>, which means something that sounds true but is actually false.</p></div>`;
