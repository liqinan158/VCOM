When you walk into a huge new school for the first time, your feeling of <i>bafflement</i> is totally understandable.</p><p class="long">Lacking any understanding about an event or situation results in bafflement, when you're so disoriented that your head spins. When you accidentally go to the Spanish III class instead of Spanish I, it's likely to result in bafflement.
