Although a <i>surge</i> offers a fluid image, anything can experience a sudden <i>surge</i>, including emotions, political support, or an angry mob.</p><p class="long">The original Latin word <i>surgere</i>, meaning “to spring up or rise,” serves as the basis for the word <i>surge</i>, which refers to a great sudden growth or swelling.  If you are watching a sad movie and you experience a sudden surge of emotion, do you quietly reach for a tissue, pretend something's in your eye, or simply weep and sob with reckless abandon?
