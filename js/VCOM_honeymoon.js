You might want to wait to get married until you meet someone who wants to go to Legoland on a <i>honeymoon</i> as much as you do.</p><p class="long">Some honeymoons are long and luxurious, involving cruises and Europe or tropical beaches and fancy hotels, while others are simple and low-key. Many married couples don't take a honeymoon at all, or wait years until having a holiday they call a <i>honeymoon</i>. In the 1540s, it was a <i>hony moone</i>, and it referred more generally to the sweet, tender span of time after a wedding. In German, it's a <i>flitterwochen</i>, or "tinsel week."</p></div></div>`;
