Some people choose to be organ donors — meaning that, after their deaths, they donate their organs to people in need of organ transplants. An organ may also serve a specific function for an institution: a periodical like a newsletter can be an organ of an organization. An organ is also the wind instrument — sometimes called a pipe organ — often played in church.</p></div></div>`;
