A <i>completely</i> ridiculous idea is absolutely crazy and stupid.</p><p class="long"><i>Completely</i> is an adverb that comes from the Latin <i>completus,</i> "to fill up." We use it to mean "entirely" or "wholly." So if a building is completely destroyed, no part of it is left standing. Reading a newspaper story or watching a documentary film completely means you finished it from beginning to end. And doing so can completely change your view on an issue.</p></div>`;
