Unlike other gods, who were worshipped in temples, <i>Pan</i> was honored outdoors.</p><p class="long">In art, Pan is usually depicted as half goat (with hooves, a tail, and horns), playing a pan flute. In fact, the musical instrument gets its name from Pan, through a myth that tells of the god's love for the wood nymph Syrinx, who was turned into a reed to avoid his attentions. When Pan heard the beautiful sound of air blowing across the reeds, he cut seven of them to make an instrument that would remind him of Syrinx.</p></div></div>`;
