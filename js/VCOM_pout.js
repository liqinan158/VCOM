And when you let the world know about it by thrusting out your lower lip, you are <i>pouting</i>. Get over it.</p><p class="long">When you pout, you’re expressing annoyance or displeasure. It’s a sulky kind of gesture, one that involves a facial expression more than words — in fact, a pout is often accompanied by a moody silence. The verb form of <i>pout</i> describes the action, and the noun form describes the facial expression. Maybe it's not a coincidence that a pout is also a type of fish. Pouting faces are a bit fish-like in their expressions.</p></div></div>`;
