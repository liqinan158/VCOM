It's common, therefore, in camping stoves and lamps, and it's a low-cost method of backup heat during power outages as well. Also known as <i>paraffin</i>, kerosene has other uses, including powering jet engines, the outboard motors of small boats, and in parts of Asia, motorcycles as well.</p></div>`;
