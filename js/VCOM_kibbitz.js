It might be hard for you not to <i>kibbitz</i> during your younger brother's chess game, especially if you consider yourself an expert.</p><p class="long">When you kibbitz, or <i>kibitz</i>, you stick your nose in where it doesn't belong, correcting mistakes or commenting on decisions that don't concern you. This verb is often used in the context of games: if you're not playing poker, but you keep whispering advice to your friend and peeking at his cards, you kibbitz. The word comes from the Yiddish <i>kibitsen</i>, "to offer gratuitous advice as an outsider."</p></div></div>`;
