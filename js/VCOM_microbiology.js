If you're fascinated by looking at tiny organisms through a microscope, you should take a class in <i>microbiology</i>.</p><p class="long">If your job involves microbiology, you're probably a microbiologist, a scientist who studies microorganisms and other microscopic things. Notice the prefix <i>micro-</i> in all of those words? It means "extremely small," from the Greek root <i>mikros</i>, "small or slight."
