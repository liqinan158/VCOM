Say you become a billionaire and you grow tired of your mansion, try <i>recreating</i> your childhood home on your estate, so you can retire modestly.</p><p class="long">To <i>recreate</i> literally means to create over. If the mural you painted on the outside of your home was damaged in a flood, you might want to recreate it with waterproof paint. <i>Recreate</i> can also mean reimagine. If you become the principal of your old high school, you could throw out the old subjects and recreate high school education as everlasting game day. <i>Recreate</i> can also mean to play â€” it gives us the word <i>recreation</i>.</p></div>`;
