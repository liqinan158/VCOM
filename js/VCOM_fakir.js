Most fakirs follow the Islamic faith, or its more mystical practice, Sufism, though there are also fakirs in Hinduism. As many religions do, Islam places importance on the idea of giving up worldly goods â€” a fakir owns nothing, only eating what he begs for. In Arabic, in fact, <i>faqir</i> means "poor man." Pronounce <i>fakir</i> with an emphasis on the last syllable, which sounds like "keer."</p></div>`;
