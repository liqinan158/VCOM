If your best friend is an <i>exhibitionist</i>, you're probably used to him suddenly bursting loudly into song in public places.</p><p class="long"><i>Exhibitionist</i> is a fancy word for "show-off." If you're an exhibitionist, you crave the kind of reaction you get from being the center of attention. In some cases, an exhibitionist gets that attention by taking his or her clothes off in public â€” a streaker or flasher is also an exhibitionist. The word comes from the Old French <i>exibicion</i>, "show or display," from the Latin <i>exhibere</i>, "to show or present."</p></div></div>`;
