Your desk <i>lamp</i> might provide enough light for you to read by at night, or you may have to turn on a floor <i>lamp</i> too after the sun goes down.</p><p class="long">Today, most lamps use electricity and a light bulb to shine the light that we all need to work and live comfortably after daylight fades. There are also older-style oil lamps and gas lamps, which are more typically described as <i>lanterns</i>. The Greek root of <i>lamp</i> is <i>lampas</i>, "torch or beacon" and also "meteor," from <i>lampein</i>, "to shine."</p></div></div>`;
