On a clear night when the moon is full, it <i>glows</i> in the sky.</p><p class="long">A nightlight glows in a dark room, and a distant flashlight beam glows like a candle. Other things that glow include fireflies, TV screens, and city lights when seen from an airplane at night. A person's face can also be said to glow, when it's shining and flushed with health or happiness. The radiance of light or pleasure itself can also be called a <i>glow</i>, from the Old English <i>glowan</i>, "to shine as if red-hot."</p></div></div>`;
