A <i>rapacious</i> landlord is out for more rent, and a <i>rapacious</i> eater is only satisfied at the all-you-can-eat buffet.</p><p class="long">A 17th-century word, from the Latin <i>rapere,</i> "to snatch," <i>rapacious</i> originally described the people and animals who often preyed on weaker creatures and devoured them, by eating them or by ruining them through some scandal. Modern-day companies even get the label <i>rapacious</i> when their appetites for profit seem to devour "lesser" interests, like the environment and employee benefits.</p></div>`;
