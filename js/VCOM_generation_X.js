Is your mom older than a millennial but younger than a baby boomer? Then she's a member of <i>generation X</i>.</p><p class="long">Most people define generation X as people born after 1965 and before 1980, although these boundaries can be fluid. When members of generation X were young, they were often thought of as cynical slackers, who were highly influenced by MTV and other media and whose parents had unusually high rates of divorce. People belonging to this generation (which is significantly smaller than the boomers before them) are known as gen Xers.</p></div>`;
