An <i>extramarital</i> affair can damage a marriage.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>extramarital</i> is almost always used to describe a romantic relationship or encounter that happens between a married person and someone who is not the person's spouse. If a married man sneaks off to meet his secret girlfriend, you can say that the man is having an extramarital affair. In this case, the Latin prefix <i>extra</i> means "outside," and <i>marital</i> comes from the Latin <i>maritalis</i>, "of marriage or married people."</p></div>`;
