If the quickest route makes you walk under a ladder, will you do it even though it’s bad luck?  These are two examples of <i>superstitions</i>, irrational decisions we make for some weird reason.  The Latin roots of the word translate as “standing over,” like how you freeze standing over a broken mirror. Don’t worry, it’s only a superstition, right?</p></div>`;
