var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">legitimize</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you <i>legitimize</i> something, you officially approve it, or make it legal. For example, a 1967 Supreme Court case <i>legitimized</i> interracial marriage in the United States.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>legitimize</i> is very similar to <i>legalize</i>, although there are some slight differences between the two. When you legalize something, you also legitimize it â€” it's permitted, or allowed. But when you legitimize something, it doesn't always involve the legal system. For example, your teacher might legitimize open-book tests or your boss could legitimize bringing dogs to work.</p></div>`;
