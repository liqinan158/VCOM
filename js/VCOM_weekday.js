Monday through Friday are weekdays, which for most people means work or school. The word <i>weekday</i> can also be used as an adjective, to describe something that happens on one of these days, like your weekday routine or the weekday traffic on your commute. This word stems from the Old English <i>wicudæge</i>, and it originally meant "any day but Sunday."</p></div></div>`;
