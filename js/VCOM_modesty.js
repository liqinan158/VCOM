If you blush, you’ve got some <i>modesty</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Modesty</i> comes from the Latin <i>modestus</i>, which literally translates as “keeping due measure.”  Knowing the correct measure of yourself is modesty, and when someone praises you too much, your modesty might kick in and make you want to tell them to be quiet.  <i>Modesty</i> also means you keep things decent and not too outrageous, like wearing clothes that hide your skin, or painting your walls beige instead of covering them with glow-in-the-dark diamond wallpaper.</p></div>`;
