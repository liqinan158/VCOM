Adding and subtracting is tricker, because that bottom number, or denominator, has to be the same in both fractions. Luckily, it's easy to give fractions common denominators. If you're adding 1/2 and 3/4, you can simply multiply that 1/2 by 2/2, which changes it to 2/4. Now the fractions you're adding have common denominators!</p></div>`;
