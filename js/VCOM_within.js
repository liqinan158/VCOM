If you find that the door to your brother’s room is locked from <i>within</i>, that means it’s locked from the inside and he really doesn't want you to enter.</p><p class="long"><i>Within</i> often refers to something on the inside of an object or structure — like those screams coming from within the haunted house. You can also use the word more figuratively to describe something that’s in your soul or mind — something that’s internal. For example, you might feel a fire within you as you start getting excited about playing in the big game.</p></div></div>`;
