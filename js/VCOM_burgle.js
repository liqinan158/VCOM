Both words basically means "to steal from inside a building." If you burgle and are caught, the crime you'll be charged with is called "burglary." <i>Burgle</i> has been in use since the 1860's, when it was a jokey, colloquial word based on <i>burglar</i>, with its Latin root of <i>burgare</i>, "to break open."</p></div></div>`;
