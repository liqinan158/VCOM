The word comes from French <i>porter</i> "carry" and <i>manteau</i> "mantle, or cloak" â€” so it's what you carry your clothes in. Or, a <i>portmanteau</i> is a word made by combining two other words.</p><p class="long">You might remember <i>portmanteau</i> from Lewis Carroll's <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>, where Humpty Dumpty explains to Alice the <i>portmanteau</i> word, in which "two meanings are packed up into one word." So, according to Humpty Dumpty, <i>slithy</i> means "lithe and slimy," and <i>mimsy</i> is "flimsy and miserable." You can make your own portmanteau words, and here are some examples for inspiration: <i>smog</i> (smoke + fog); <i>brunch</i> (breakfast + lunch), <i>sitcom</i> (situation + comedy), and <i>infomercial</i> (information + commercial).</p></div></div>`;
