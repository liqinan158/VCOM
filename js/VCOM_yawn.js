Even seeing photos of other people's <i>yawns</i> (or reading the word <i>yawn</i>) can make you <i>yawn</i>.</p><p class="long">We yawn when we're very bored or tired, or when our bodies need an influx of oxygen. Scientists aren't completely in agreement about all the reasons why we yawn, but the "contagious <i>yawn</i>" happens across all human societies and even in non-human animals like chimpanzees and dogs. Things can also yawn in a figurative way, when they're open wide. <i>Yawn</i> comes from <i>gionian</i> in Old English, "open the mouth wide."</p></div>`;
