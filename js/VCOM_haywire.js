You'll sense that things have gone <i>haywire</i> at a birthday party if suddenly the young guests are having a crazed water gun fight indoors.</p><p class="long">A riot is an extreme example of things going haywire, when people get angry enough about something that they ignore rules and laws, breaking windows and setting things on fire. A less serious case of things gone haywire could be a flock of chickens escaping an enclosure, running loose in your vegetable garden. The literal, and original, meaning of <i>haywire</i> is "wire used to bind hay." The wire's "springy unpredictability" led to today's common definition.</p></div>`;
