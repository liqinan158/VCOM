If you and your coworkers talk behind each other's backs, you will create a nasty <i>atmosphere</i> at work.</p><p class="long"><i>Atmosphere</i> was coined by 17th-century scientists combining the Greek words for vapor, <i>atmos</i>, and sphere, <i>sphaira</i>. The earth's atmosphere is the air and gas surrounding our planet. <i>Atmosphere</i> also describes the feeling of a place. A coffee shop might have a cool, artsy atmosphere. Some plants grow best in a damp atmosphere. In physics, <i>atmosphere</i> is a unit of pressure equal to the air pressure at sea level.</p></div>`;
