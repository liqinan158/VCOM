Use either word to mean "assert" or "declare." While it's unusual to hear people use <i>avouch</i>, it's common to say something like, "I'll vouch for my friend," meaning you'll give evidence or make a guarantee on your friend's behalf. The root of <i>avouch</i> is the Latin <i>advocare</i>, "call to as a witness."</p></div></div>`;
