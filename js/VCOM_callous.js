If you laugh at your little sister while she's trying to show you her poetry, you're being <i>callous</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Callous</i> comes from the Latin root <i>callum</i> for hard skin.  If you walk barefoot a lot, your feet will become calloused. We often use <i>callous</i>, as an adjective or a verb, in the metaphorical sense for emotionally hardened. If someone is unmoved by other people's problems, you might say he shows a callous indifference to human suffering or that his heart has been calloused by his own problems.</p></div></div>`;
