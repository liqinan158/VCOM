In some Christian churches, a <i>proselyte</i> must be baptized.</p><p class="long">You can use the word <i>proselyte</i> to talk about any kind of convert, even those that aren't religious. You could, for example, call your brother a proselyte if he voted for a Republican in the last election but recently joined the Democratic party. The most common use of the word, however, is someone who converts to Judaism. <i>Proselyte</i> has a Greek root, <i>proselytos</i>, which means both "convert to Judaism" and "one who has come over."</p></div></div>`;
