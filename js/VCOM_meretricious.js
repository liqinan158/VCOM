var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">meretricious</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Have you ever heard the phrase "fake it until you make it"? That is advice that encourages you to be <i>meretricious</i>, pretending to be something you aren't, like the <i>meretricious</i> flaunting of gigantic fake diamond earrings, pretending they are real â€” and that you can afford them.</p><p class="long">To correctly pronounce <i>meretricious</i>, accent the third syllable: "mer-uh-TRISH-us." Don't mistake something that is meretricious for having merit. In fact, it is just the opposite. From an expensive restaurant that looks expensively furnished but when the lights are turned up, you can see that "leather" chairs are just cheap vinyl or a woman who pretends her counterfeit handbags are designer originals, meretricious actions are meant to deceive.</p></div></div>`;
