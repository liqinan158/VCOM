Or, you could just start putting it together, only to discover that you have extra pieces.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>direction</i> has several meanings. It can be an order given, as in, "Here are your directions: pick up your toys and make the bed!" <i>Direction</i> can also be something that points out a route as when you ask for directions to the lake. The course leading to a certain point is also a direction so you need to go in a southerly direction for ten miles, and then turn left at the giant chicken sign.</p></div>`;
