The ocean seems <i>peaceful</i> when the waves lap gently at your feet, and a country can be <i>peaceful</i> when it's not fighting anyone.</p><p class="long"><i>Peace</i> comes from the Latin word <i>pax</i> meaning, "tranquility, absence of war." Add the suffix <i>ful</i> which means — you guessed it — "full" and you have something full of peace, like a protest where nobody gets hurt. It refers to being passive, committed to nonviolence, like Martin Luther King Jr.'s peaceful protests during the Civil Rights Movement. It's also the mellowness that inspired the Eagles to sing, "I got a peaceful, easy feeling that you won't let me down."</p></div>`;
