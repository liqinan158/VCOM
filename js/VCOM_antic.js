It’s outrageous, but it’s usually meant to be funny. When the senior class steals the principal’s car and manages to get it inside the gym, the <i>antic</i> may be condemned by the school, but everyone else probably thinks it’s hilarious.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>antic</i> is most commonly used in the plural form, as in “the coach was growing tired of his star player’s silly antics after scoring.” Sometimes antics can lean toward the not-so-funny side as well. Really ridiculous behavior that is more foolish than funny can also be called <i>antics</i>. <i>Antic</i> can also be used an as adjective, as in "her antic stand-up routine had everyone rolling in the aisles." It more infrequently can be used as a verb meaning "to act like a clown."</p></div>`;
