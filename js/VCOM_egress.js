An egress is basically the same thing as an exit. (<i>Egress</i> can also be used as a verb, "to exit," but less frequently than as a noun.) When buildings undergo inspection, one of the main safety features under review is the number and placement of doors and windows, the "means of <i>egress</i>," in case of fire or other emergency.</p></div>`;
