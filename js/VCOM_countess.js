Marrying a viscount or count is another way to gain the title of countess. The idea of such a title, and the word itself, may seem old-fashioned, but there are many countesses living today in England and Scotland. The word <i>countess</i> comes from <i>count</i> and its Latin root, <i>comes</i>, "companion to the emperor."</p></div></div>`;
