He's <i>unaccommodating</i>. You can also say he's difficult or unhelpful.</p><p class="long">Unaccommodating people make things hard for others, often by refusing to acquiesce to what other people want. An unaccommodating restaurant doesn't offer any vegetarian options and won't leave the olives out of your meal, even though you hate them. And an unaccommodating person might insist on meeting at her own house, refusing to meet halfway between your homes. <i>Accommodating</i> means "helpful or considerate." When you add the <i>un-</i> ("not") prefix, you get <i>unaccommodating</i>.</p></div>`;
