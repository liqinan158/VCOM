The verb <i>loiter</i> is similar to “hang out,” but it has a more negative connotation and is sometimes associated with acting illegally. You might <i>hang out</i> at your friend’s house watching movies, but you would <i>loiter</i> by the vending machine at school when you are supposed be in class.</p></div></div>`;
