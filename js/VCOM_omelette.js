Next time you go out to breakfast, try ordering an <i>omelette</i> instead of your usual fried eggs!</p><p class="long">The word <i>omelette</i> is French, from a root meaning "thin, small plate," a reference to an omelette's flat shape. Historians have traced the omelette back to ancient Persia, where cooks made savory dishes using beaten eggs. Today's omelette is generally fluffy and filled with cheese, and while the one you get at a diner may seem large, it can't match the world's largest omelette, which weighed over 14,000 pounds and used 145,000 eggs.</p></div>`;
