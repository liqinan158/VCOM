Tigers, lions, bears––animals with powerful paws and sharp claws, will <i>maul</i> their victims.</p><p class="long">The maul came to be used as a weapon in the late Middle Ages––if your opponent is wearing armor that a steel sword-blade can't penetrate, you can still inflict damage by mauling them with a hammer. You might not be able to stab your opponent, but at least you can maul them.</p></div>`;
