Traditionally, obits were published in newspapers either daily or weekly, while today they're just as likely to be published online, often posted by a funeral home or church that's hosting memorial services. <i>Obit</i> comes from the Latin <i>obitus</i>, "death," the past participle of <i>obire</i>, "to go toward" or "to die."</p></div>`;
