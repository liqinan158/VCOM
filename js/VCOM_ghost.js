In most stories and myths, <i>ghosts</i> are pale, translucent, and wispy.</p><p class="long">Throughout history, the idea that a person's soul or spirit can remain visible after her death has been common. Some of us long to see the ghost of a loved relative, while others are terrified of the very idea. From this main idea, the word <i>ghost</i> has also come to mean the hint or shade of something: "The <i>ghost</i> of a smile remained on her lips." The Old English root is <i>gast</i>, "spirit," and also "breath."</p></div></div>`;
