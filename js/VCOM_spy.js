It’s not recommended unless you’re actually a <i>spy</i>, a person who is hired by a government or organization to keep tabs on enemies.</p><p class="long">You might imagine a spy working for the CIA or the KGB, but there are also military spies who infiltrate their opponents' armies to get information, commit sabotage, or steal technology.
