That drawing your cousin made of a house with a pointy roof, smiling stick figures, and a round yellow sun? Very <i>schematic</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>schematic</i> can apply to ideas as well as drawings. In this case, <i>schematic</i> describes an overly simple interpretation of something complex, like a work of literature or a detailed plan for social change. Think of it like the drawing of a boxy house and stick figures, only applied to ideas â€” it's an outline of something that may not capture all the important details.</p></div>`;
