You could describe a defendant in a trial as having a juridical advantage if all the evidence presented seems to be in her favor; the juridical result might be that a jury finds her not guilty. The Latin root of <i>juridical</i> is <i>iuridicalis</i>, or "pertaining to justice," which in turn comes from <i>ius</i>, "right or law," and <i>dicere</i>, "to speak."</p></div>`;
