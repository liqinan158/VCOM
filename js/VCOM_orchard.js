If you visit New England in autumn, make sure to stop by a local apple <i>orchard</i> and pick a few baskets to take home.</p><p class="long">From the Old English <i>orceard</i> blossomed our modern-day spelling of <i>orchard</i>, a noun meaning “fruit farm.” But you can also use the word figuratively to refer to something filled with treats or precious content. The US Congregational minister, Henry Ward Beecher, was famous for having proclaimed, “A book is a garden, an <i>orchard</i>, a storehouse, a party, a company by the way, a counselor, a multitude of counselors.”</p></div>`;
