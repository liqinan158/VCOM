Fatalists share the certainty that fate has already been laid out in front of them, and that they have no real control over what will happen. Sometimes fatalists have a flat or unemotional reaction even to frightening circumstances because of these beliefs. The Latin root is <i>fatalis</i>, "ordained by fate or destined."</p></div></div>`;
