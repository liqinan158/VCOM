After an <i>annulment</i>, it's like the marriage never happened.</p><p class="long">The root <i>nul </i> (from Latin <i>nullum</i>) of this word is a good clue to its meaning: the underlying verb <i>annul</i> originally meant "reduce to nothing." An annulment also reduces something to nothing by canceling or terminating it, usually in a legal sense. The most common use of the term is the annulment of a marriage, which not only ends the marriage, but legally makes it as if the marriage never happened. Annulment is like a legal eraser.</p></div>`;
