The root is the Latin word <i>separare</i>, which means "to pull apart." A separation from someone you care about can be hard, but the trickiest thing about <i>separation</i> is remembering how to spell it. One common trick is to keep in mind that there's "a rat" in the middle of the word.</p></div>`;
