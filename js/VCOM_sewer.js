The water that runs down a storm drain also ends up in a <i>sewer</i>.</p><p class="long">After you take a shower, or wash dishes, or flush the toilet, that used waste water runs through pipes away from your house. It travels either to a small septic system, or to a larger, city-wide sewer system, where it's treated to make it safe and clean enough to release into the environment. The origin of <i>sewer</i> can be traced to the Old North French <i>sewiere</i>, "sluice from a pond," or "something that makes water flow."</p></div></div>`;
