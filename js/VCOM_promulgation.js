If you want to sound especially formal or fancy, you can call your book club's notification of a venue change a promulgation. It comes from the Latin <i>promulgare</i>, "make publicly known," itself a combination of <i>pro</i>, "out," and <i>mulgere</i>, "to cause to come forth," or literally, "to milk."</p></div>`;
