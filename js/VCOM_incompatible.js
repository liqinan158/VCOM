var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">incompatible</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the adjective <i>incompatible</i> to describe things or people that are too different to get along. When paired with someone you can't work with, don't criticize or get mad. Just say, "We are <i>incompatible</i>."</p><p class="long">Put together the prefix <i>in-</i> and the suffix <i>-ible</i> and what do you get? "Not able." The center of <i>incompatible</i> comes from Latin, <i>compati</i>, or "suffer with." So think of incompatible as a way to describe something you simply are not able to suffer — there's too much conflict. Things can be incompatible just like people. Just try hooking up an incompatible piece of hardware to your computer — it won't work because it was designed for a different system.</p></div>`;
