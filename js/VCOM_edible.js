Many things that you may not want to eat are, in fact, <i>edible</i>. Certain insects are <i>edible</i>, which just means that you can consume them without getting sick (if it doesn't gross you out too much).</p><p class="long"><i>Edible</i> comes from the Latin word <i>edere</i>, which means “to eat.” Anything that people can safely eat is described as <i>edible</i>. Long before there were complex labels on  our packages of food, human predecessors were living in caves and sampling various plants and animals for their survival, all the while learning the hard way whether or not certain things were either <i>edible</i> or poisonous. You are most likely a descendant of the ones who found the <i>edible</i> stuff.</p></div>`;
