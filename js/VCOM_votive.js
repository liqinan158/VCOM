A votive candle is lit when a vow is made. A votive altar has been blessed by a holy person and can be used in making religious vows. Many votive things are related to religion, like a votive ceremony related to honoring a saint. Votive activities should not be undertaken lightly, because a vow is more serious than a regular promise.</p></div></div>`;
