First, itâ€™s the equipment we need for a sport or event. A <i>gear</i> is also a wheel with teeth that interlocks with another <i>gear</i> to transmit motion in a machine.</p><p class="long">The background of <i>gear</i> as "equipment" dates back to around 1200 and comes from the Old Norse <i>gervi</i>, "apparel." The word <i>gear</i> in machinery became common in the early 19th century, although there is evidence that the word came to mean "toothed wheel" as early as 1520. <i>Gear</i> entered English slang around 1951, meaning something stylish. This use was popularized in the 1960s, under the influence of British pop music.</p></div></div>`;
