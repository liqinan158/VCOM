Gray urban landscapes and the black surface of a lake on a starless night could both be described as achromatic. In physics, the word <i>achromatic</i> is a bit more complicated, meaning "able to reflect light without it separating into colors." The Greek root word is <i>akhrōmatikos</i>, "colorless," combining the prefix <i>a</i>,"without," and <i>khrōma</i>, "color."</p></div>`;
