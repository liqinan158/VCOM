The U.S. Congress is made up of elected senators and representatives from all fifty states who vote on and enact new laws. In late Middle English, <i>congress</i> meant a "meeting during battle," from the Latin <i>congressus</i>, which means both "a friendly meeting" and "a hostile encounter," both of which, in fact, describe the United States Congress.</p></div>`;
