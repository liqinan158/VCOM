Your neighbors' <i>patio</i> might be paved with bricks and decorated with flowers in pots.</p><p class="long">Some patios are paved with stone or concrete slabs that together form a sort of outdoor floor. You can also call this area a <i>terrace</i>, <i>verandah</i>, or <i>courtyard</i>. A patio is usually located beside or behind a house or apartment building, although some public buildings also have patios — a restaurant might have a patio for outdoor seating, for example. <i>Patio</i> means "court open to the sky" in Spanish, from the Old Provençal <i>pati</i>, "communal pasture."</p></div></div>`;
