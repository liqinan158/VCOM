It is a very bad idea to go walking in a <i>marsh</i> in your best shoes; try some fishing boots, or perhaps a boat.</p><p class="long">The word <i>marsh</i> comes from the old Dutch word <i>mere</i>, for sea, and it means land that is sea-ish… not sea, but sea-ish, like most of Holland. Marshes can be found often where a river empties into the sea, or along the side of a low, flooded river. Another word for marsh is <i>swamp</i>. If you’re in trouble or just want to be alone, a marsh is a great place to hide: no one will follow you. Just don’t forget your galoshes.</p></div>`;
