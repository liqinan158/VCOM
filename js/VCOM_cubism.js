Pablo Picasso was one of the most well-known masters of <i>cubism</i>.</p><p class="long">Cubism began in the early 20th century, when artists started experimenting with abstract works, attempting to show many angles and planes simultaneously. They rejected realistic perspective and tone, not even trying to make their paintings look three-dimensional. Cubism was all about breaking up images and reassembling them into small, flat shapes instead. The term <i>cubism</i> was coined after a French art critic derided what he called "bizarreries cubiques," or "cubic oddities."</p></div></div>`;
