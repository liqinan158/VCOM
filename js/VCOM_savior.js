Say you're hanging by your fingernails from the ledge of a burning building. When the firefighter appears to carry you to safety, it would be appropriate to cry, "My <i>savior</i> has arrived!"</p><p class="long">If you rescue the rarely seen white-fanged mudslide chameleon from extinction, wildlife enthusiasts would no doubt call you the creature's savior. Savior, with a capital S, is one of the names Christians use for Jesus, Savior of the World, Lord and Savior, the one who saves souls. As you've no doubt noticed, the word <i>savior</i> is connected to the word <i>save,</i> â€” both words come from the Latin <i>salvare,</i> which means simply "to save."</p></div></div>`;
