var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">spew</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>spew</i> is to forcefully expel something, the way a volcano <i>spews</i> hot lava when it erupts, or the way you might <i>spew</i> soda from your mouth if your friend makes you laugh right after you take a big gulp.</p><p class="long">You might see steam spew from the factory near your house or watch a city bus spew smoke from its exhaust pipe. Figuratively, to <i>spew</i> can also mean "to say ugly or hateful things," and some people also use it to mean "vomit." The Old English source of <i>spew</i> is <i>spiwan</i> ("to spit") and comes from a root that probably imitated the sound of someone spitting.</p></div>`;
