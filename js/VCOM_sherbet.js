Though it looks like ice cream, <i>sherbet</i> is a little different since it's made with little or no milk or cream.</p><p class="long">Since sherbet is typically made with fruit, it often comes in shockingly bright colors like pink, orange, or green and has a refreshing taste. This delicious summer treat has been around a long time, in some form at least â€” the word <i>sherbet</i> came into English in the 17th century from the Turkish word <i>zerbet</i>, meaning "drink made from diluted fruit juice and sugar." Make sure you don't add an extra "r" in <i>sherbet</i>: the ending is spelled "bet."</p></div></div>`;
