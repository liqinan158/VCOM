If you're <i>handy</i> in the kitchen, you're a good cook.</p><p class="long">A carpenter tends to be handy with a saw or a hammer, and if you're good at sewing, you're handy with a needle and thread. Another meaning of <i>handy</i> is "useful" or "convenient." Your laptop is handy because you use it for all kinds of things, and your smartphone is handy because you always keep it in your pocket â€” it's right there when you need it.</p></div></div>`;
