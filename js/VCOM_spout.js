A pitcher's <i>spout</i> helps you direct your orange juice into your glass.</p><p class="long">Some spouts are indentations or lips, and others — like the spout on a teapot — are tubes. Another meaning of <i>spout</i> is "gush suddenly in a stream." If you filled your teapot too full, tea might spout from its spout. When someone figuratively spouts, she talks in a loud, animated way. The verb form of <i>spout</i> came first, from a Proto-Germanic root that also spawned the Middle Dutch <i>spoiten</i> and the Swedish <i>sputa</i>, both also meaning <i>spout</i>.</p></div></div>`;
