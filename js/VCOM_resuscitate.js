In recent years it's become important for people to learn CPR so that they might <i>resuscitate</i> someone who loses consciousness, and many schools and hospitals offer classes in CPR.</p><p class="long">The Latin word <i>suscitƒÅre</i>, "to raise," combines with <i>re-</i>, "again," to create the base of the verb <i>resuscitate</i>. Through the years, methods of resuscitation have advanced to the current sophisticated and effective levels of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, and defibrillation paddles that can shock a heart back to life. In fact, some patients nowadays ask to sign a "do not <i>resuscitate</i>" (DNR) order to allow them to die without medical interventions like resuscitation.</p></div></div>`;
