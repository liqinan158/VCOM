var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">seemly</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">You don't want to seem anything less than <i>seemly</i>, especially in the presence of the Queen. Only <i>seemly</i> behavior is allowed when she's around.</p><p class="long">Seemly behavior is polite, decent, upright, and appropriate. You'll need to get schooled in the ways of more seemly people before you can be allowed in the fanciest restaurant in town. At the moment, your ratty clothes, smelly feet, and bad manners can only be described as "unseemly" â€” which is, of course, the opposite of <i>seemly</i>. One way to remember the meaning of <i>seemly</i> is to think of how you'd like to "seem" to others. Chances are the answer is something like <i>seemly</i>. Unless you enjoy seeming like a big mess.</p></div>`;
