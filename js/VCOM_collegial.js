You know you work in a <i>collegial</i> environment when your co-workers smile at you, and you don’t have to hide from your supervisor.</p><p class="long">Sharing its origins with <i>college</i> and <i>colleague</i>, <i>collegial</i> has senses relating to both words. A collegial office describes the shared responsibility or congenial relationship of colleagues, meaning people who happily or pleasantly work together. The word <i>collegial</i> can also be a synonym for <i>collegiate</i>, describing something that is like or typical of colleges or colleges students. But no frat parties at the office, okay? That may be collegiate, but it doesn’t always lead to collegial behavior.</p></div></div>`;
