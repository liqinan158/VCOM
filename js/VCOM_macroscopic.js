A scientist might use <i>macroscopic</i> to talk about the regular view of an object, when you're looking at it unaided by any magnification device. The macroscopic view of a leaf is quite different from the microscopic, which reveals the molecules that comprise it. <i>Macro-</i> means "large," from the Greek root <i>makros</i>, "long or large."</p></div>`;
