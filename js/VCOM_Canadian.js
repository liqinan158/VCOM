Drive far enough north in any contiguous U.S. state, and you'll eventually cross the Canadian border. Once you're there, you may see a Canadian moose, use Canadian dollar bills, and eat Canadian poutine (French fries with cheese curds and gravy). The root of <i>Canada</i> and <i>Canadian</i> is thought to be a word meaning "village" in a now-extinct Iroquoian language.</p></div></div>`;
