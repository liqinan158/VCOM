Many <i>etudes</i> are meant to be played on the piano.</p><p class="long">Well-known composers like Debussy and Chopin wrote piano etudes that continue to be used for teaching beginning musicians. There are also etudes composed for other instruments, like guitar, violin, and cello. In French, the word <i>Ã©tude</i> means "study," from the Latin <i>studium</i>, which also means "study," though it first meant "eagerness," from <i>studere</i>, "to be diligent."</p></div>`;
