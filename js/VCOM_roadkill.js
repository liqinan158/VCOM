Some people are so sensitive they can't stand to look at <i>roadkill</i>.</p><p class="long">Animals that die on a highway, usually because they've been struck by a vehicle, are roadkill. You can also spell it as two words, <i>road kill</i>. The word is fairly modern, from the early 1970's, in part because before cars were invented — and before there were so many of them on the roads — there weren't so many animals affected by the transportation of humans. Use the term figuratively when someone feels unwanted: "I felt like <i>roadkill</i> when you didn't invite me."</p></div>`;
