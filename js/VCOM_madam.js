A waiter at a fancy restaurant might say, "Your table is ready, <i>madam</i>."</p><p class="long">If a stranger calls a woman <i>madam</i>, he probably sees her as a mature, dignified person. If the woman is younger, she is more likely to be called "miss," and sometimes madam is abbreviated as "ma'am." Another kind of <i>madam</i> is a woman who owns or runs a house of prostitution. <i>Madam</i> comes from the French phrase <i>ma dame</i>, "my lady."</p></div></div>`;
