To <i>harpoon</i> is to strike an animal, like a whale, with a <i>harpoon</i>.

When people hunt sea life such as whales and sharks, they use a type of spear called a harpoon. A harpoon is long like a spear, but it's also barbed, so when it penetrates an animal, it sticks in. The hunter throws the harpoon, and it has a line attached to it â€” much like a fishing line. Hunting animals in this way is called harpooning.</p></div>`;
