If your sister wants to annoy you, she'll <i>dredge up</i> that story about how you caught your dangly earring in your braces.</p><p class="long">If your uncle loves telling stories that everyone else had forgotten about — and no one is eager to remember — your parents might say, "Let's not invite him for Thanksgiving this year. He always dredges up terrible memories!" This expression comes from the verb <i>dredge</i>, which means to scoop mud, trash, and other gross stuff out of a body of water.</p></div>`;
