Historic moments are so important or momentous that they'll show up in history textbooks. A building can be historic, and so can a speech or a battle or a disaster. The root word is the Greek <i>historia</i>, "a learning by inquiry or history," although <i>historic</i> specifically means "important in history."</p></div>`;
