Your <i>lowly</i> position on a sports team might make you best suited to carry all of the players' equipment.</p><p class="long">When a person is described as <i>lowly</i>, the world often refers to their job or social class. A lowly janitor might not get as much respect as the CEO of a huge company, even if she's a kinder person. A lowly member of an AAA baseball team might only dream about joining the major leagues. The adjective <i>lowly</i> has been around since the 14th century, from <i>low</i>, "not high," and also "humble in rank."</p></div>`;
