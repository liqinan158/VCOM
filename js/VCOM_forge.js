Well, no, probably not, but they use a special furnace which is called a <i>forge,</i> and "to <i>forge</i> something" is also the act of bashing that hot object into shape.</p><p class="long"><i>Forge</i> has also taken on the more general sense of creating something. A new philosophy or art form might have been forged, as might an alibi or an excuse. To <i>forge</i> something also has the meaning of faking something, such as a painting or a signature with the intent to deceive. It can also mean to move ahead in a steady manner, either physically or metaphorically, much like those solid, regular blows of the blacksmith's hammer.</p></div>`;
