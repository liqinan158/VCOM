Think it over, because you can only choose once.</p><p class="long">Crypts, mausoleums, sarcophagi, sepulchers: each one is a place to bury someone, with slight variations.  A <i>sepulcher</i> (or if you’re British you’ll spell it <i>sepulchre</i>) is basically a stone room with a stone coffin where your body lies.  The word comes from the Latin <i>sepulcrum</i>, which means “burial place,” for obvious reasons.  Pronouncing <i>sepulcher</i> could trick you, because the <i>ch</i> actually sounds like a <i>k</i>: "SEP-ul-ker."</p></div>`;
