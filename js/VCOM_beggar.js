Another word for a <i>beggar</i> is a "panhandler," although both terms are vaguely offensive. No one wants to be a <i>beggar</i>.</p><p class="long">Many people who are beggars are also homeless and haven't been able to find jobs. Sometimes people use the word in an informal, pitying way: "Poor little <i>beggar</i>, he works so hard!" Another informal term is "to <i>beggar</i> belief," as when something is so incredible that you find it hard to believe. Another expression is “<i>beggars</i> can’t be choosers” which means you get what you get and you don’t get upset.</p></div></div>`;
