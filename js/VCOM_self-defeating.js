If you really want to make friends with someone, it would be <i>self-defeating</i> to say something mean to them.</p><p class="long">If your actions keep the thing you really hope for from working out, they're self-defeating. It's also self-defeating to be drawn to people who will inevitably treat you badly, or to eat foods you know are going to make your stomach hurt later. Behavior that seems destined to harm you — writing your friend's English paper but not your own, for example — is also self-defeating. <i>Defeating</i> stems from the Vuglar Latin <i>diffacere</i>, "destroy or undo."</p></div></div>`;
