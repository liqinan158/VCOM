It wasnâ€™t until 1808 that you could use <i>code</i> to describe a system for sending secret messages. The verb form appeared in 1815, meaning to create laws or send secret messages, and gave birth to <i>encode.</i> In the computer programming context, <i>encode</i> was shortened back again to <i>code,</i> meaning to write instructions for a computer program. Soon the lines of text themselves began to be referred to as simply <i>code</i>.</p></div>`;
