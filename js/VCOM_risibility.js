In fact, it means "readiness to laugh." You might remark on the risibility of your giggly little cousin. The etymology of <i>risibility</i> is somewhat obscured by the conjugation of its Latin root, <i>ridere</i>, which means "to laugh," but which also gives us <i>deride</i> and <i>ridiculous</i>.</p></div>`;
