That could be because it's one letter away from <i>filth</i>, but it's also true that stealing is usually considered a dirty, lowdown deed. No one wants their things to be filched. Filching is similar to pilfering, swiping, lifting, and purloining â€” other words for taking what isn't yours. We've all probably filched at some point, but thieves make a profession out of filching.</p></div></div>`;
