If you expect to be a doctor but you haven't taken any science courses since high school biology, you would have a <i>disjunction</i> between your expectations and your training.</p><p class="long">The <i>-junct-</i> in <i>disjunction</i> is the same Latin root that gives us <i>yoke</i>, the harness that joins two oxen together. So if you have a <i>disjunction</i>, things are not joined together — there's a disconnect. If you order a pizza and the waiter brings you caviar, that's a <i>disjunction</i>. In logic, a <i>disjunction</i> is made by joining two sentences with "or" — "I'm tired, or I'm hungry" — while a <i>conjunction</i> joins two sentences with "and" — "I'm tired, and I'm hungry."</p></div></div>`;
