Your body's <i>circadian</i> rhythm is made up of processes that occur regularly every 24 hours.</p><p class="long">You'll find the word <i>circadian</i> in biology class, or your anatomy and physiology textbook, because it describes a biological process in the human body, as well as in other organisms. Your cycle of sleep, for example, happens on a circadian schedule â€” approximately every 24 hours, you become tired enough to lie down and close your eyes, a built-in rhythm that's affected somewhat by light. <i>Circadian</i> comes from Latin roots, <i>circa</i>, "about," and <i>diem</i>, "day."</p></div>`;
