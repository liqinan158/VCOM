Maybe they shouldn't call it a <i>lounge</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Lounge</i> comes from the French <i>s'allonger</i> meaning "to lounge about, lie at full length." Whether you're talking about a room with seats in a hotel made for waiting, or a nice comfy sofa, or the act of reclining comfortably, <i>lounge</i> has everything to do with making yourself comfortable in one spot for a while. It also means to hang around in an easy way, the way you might lounge around the poolside area in a luxury hotel.</p></div>`;
