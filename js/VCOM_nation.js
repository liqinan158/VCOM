It's also the word used for the Native American tribal federations in the US — the Cherokee <i>Nation</i>, for instance — which have their own governments and territories.</p><p class="long"><i>Nation</i> comes from the Latin root <i>nat-</i>, which means "born" — the neonatal unit in a hospital is where the newborn babies are cared for. You can also use <i>nation</i> more loosely for ethnic or religious groups: you might speak of "the Jewish <i>nation</i>," meaning not just the country, or nation, of Israel, but Jews all over the world. The Nation of Islam is an African-American Muslim group.</p></div></div>`;
