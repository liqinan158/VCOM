If something gets your blood up, that means it makes you angry. You might even get so mad that it feels like your blood boils. You can also use <i>blood</i> to describe a common ancestry. You might have Scottish blood in you — that means some of your ancestors came from Scotland. <i>Blood</i> can also describe family members — you may get frustrated at your brother sometimes but he’s your own flesh and blood.</p></div></div>`;
