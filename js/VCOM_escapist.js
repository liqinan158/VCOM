If you're an <i>escapist</i>, you might avoid thinking about unpleasant things by playing video games for hours.</p><p class="long">Some escapists can withdraw into their own heads, distracting themselves with daydreams. Other escapists retreat from the world into movies, television, books, games, alcohol, or even exercise. The goal for an escapist is to <i>escape</i> the difficulties of life and their own feelings through these diversions. <i>Escapist</i> and <i>escape</i> are rooted in the Vulgar Latin <i>excappare</i>, literally "leave a pursuer with only one's cape."</p></div></div>`;
