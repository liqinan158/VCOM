Both adjectives essentially mean "like a saint," so you can call your incredibly patient teacher saintlike, or talk about your saintlike next door neighbor, who never complains about your barking dog and loud music. <i>Saintlike</i> and <i>saint</i> have a Latin root that means "holy."</p></div></div>`;
