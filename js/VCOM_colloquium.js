At a <i>colloquium</i>, you’ll spend a couple of days listening to lectures with a group of people who all know a lot about one particular subject.</p><p class="long">The root of <i>colloquium</i> is the Latin <i>loqui</i>, meaning “to talk, ” which is what people tend to do at a conference. If you’re attending a colloquium on hummingbirds, you’re going to meet a lot of biologists who talk about hummingbirds. If you’re giving a lecture at the same colloquium, you’d better hope you know a lot about hummingbirds or you might get run out of the conference!</p></div>`;
