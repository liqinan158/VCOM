The mother of a teenage boy might <i>agonize</i> over his safety when he first learns to drive.</p><p class="long"><i>Agonize</i> can mean to suffer true pain, but it's generally a mental type of anguish. A student might agonize over what to wear the first day of school, and a boss might agonize about how to break the bad news about layoffs to her employees. The earliest meaning of <i>agonize</i> was "to torture," though now it means something closer to "to torture one's self." The Greek root is a grand one: <i>agonizesthai</i>, "to contend in the struggle."</p></div>`;
