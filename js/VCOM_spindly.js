A newborn foal looks so vulnerable, with its <i>spindly</i> legs, but it's almost immediately able to stand up and walk.</p><p class="long">A <i>spindle</i> is a slim wooden rod used to spin wool, and <i>spindly</i> essentially means "like a spindle." You can use it to describe a skinny person's long, thin limbs, like a young ballerina's spindly arms or the spindly legs of an elementary school basketball team. Spindly objects tend to be fragile, too: "These spindly antique chairs make me nervous â€” I'll sit on the couch."</p></div></div>`;
