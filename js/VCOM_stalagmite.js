When you go spelunking, or cave exploring, you'll have to avoid the areas where <i>stalagmites</i> have formed.</p><p class="long">Stalagmites are thin piles of mineral deposits that have fallen from the roof to the floor of a cave. They're sometimes connected to the stalactites that dangle down from the top. Because stalagmites form from drops of water combined with minerals, they get their name from the Greek <i>stalagmos</i>, "a dropping,"  and share a root with <i>stalactite</i> â€” the Greek <i>stalassein</i>, "to trickle."</p></div>`;
