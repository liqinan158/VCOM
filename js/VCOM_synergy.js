Separately each of you is pretty good, but together you’ve got a mega-hit song. That’s <i>synergy</i> — working together to create something greater than either of you could do alone.</p><p class="long">The word <i>synergy</i> comes from the Greek <i>sun</i> “together” and <i>ergon</i> “work” (the same root that gives us <i>ergonomic</i> and <i>energy</i>).  When one thing magnifies the effect of another, together they have synergy. If your company makes some revolutionary kind of yo-yo, you may decide to acquire a company that distributes toys, as you’d expect there would be a natural synergy: each company will benefit from the other’s strengths, and together they’ll be stronger than either would be by itself.</p></div>`;
