It can feel like a competitive sport to hail a <i>cab</i> in New York City.</p><p class="long">Your cab driver may talk incessantly while she drives you to the airport, or you might ride in a cab that's silent except for the sound of its horn honking at other drivers. You can also call the front part of a truck, where the driver sits, the <i>cab</i>. In the 1820s, the word meant "horse-drawn carriage," short for the French <i>cabriolet</i>, "leap or caper." The Latin root is <i>capreolus</i>, "wild goat."</p></div></div>`;
