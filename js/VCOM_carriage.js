In some cities, you can go for a <i>carriage</i> ride through the park.</p><p class="long">A carriage generally has four wheels and is pulled by two or more horses, while the smaller <i>cart</i> tends to have two wheels and be pulled by a single horse. In Britain, you might hear people refer to the separate compartments of a train as <i>carriages</i> as well, and in some parts of the US it's used to mean "baby stroller" or "grocery cart."
