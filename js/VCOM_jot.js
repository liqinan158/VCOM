You might <i>jot</i> down a friend's email address on the back of your grocery list.</p><p class="long">It's most common to use the verb <i>jot</i> with <i>down</i>: "Hang on, let me <i>jot down</i> the appointment time." It's a good word to use when you're writing a brief note, a phone number, or a list â€” especially when you're doing it in a hurry. The earliest meaning of <i>jot</i> is "a tiny bit," which comes from the Latin word <i>jota</i>, an alternate spelling of the Greek <i>iota</i>, the smallest letter in the alphabet or the smallest amount of something.</p></div></div>`;
