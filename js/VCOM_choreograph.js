Some dancers <i>choreograph</i> their own dances, although usually a choreographer does it.</p><p class="long">A dance, whether ballet or bhangra, is made up of a sequence of movements and steps â€” when you plan those movements, you choreograph. You might also choreograph other kinds of routines, like figure skating, cheerleading, or a marching band performance. You can even use the word to describe planning things that don't involve physical movement: "My boss is a control freak, so she'll probably <i>choreograph</i> the whole meeting." The Greek roots are <i>khoreia</i>, "dance," and <i>graphein</i>, "to write."</p></div></div>`;
