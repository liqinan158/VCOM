Unless you make your bed neatly in the morning, your blankets will still be <i>rumpled</i> when you climb in at bedtime.</p><p class="long">You'll make a better impression at a job interview if you wear crisp pants and an ironed shirt than if you show up in a rumpled suit. You can even describe a person as looking rumpled, if they seem generally messy and bedraggled. The adjective <i>rumpled</i> comes from the verb <i>rumple</i>, which is most likely a variation on the now-obsolete <i>rimple</i>, "to wrinkle."</p></div>`;
