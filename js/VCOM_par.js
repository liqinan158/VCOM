You might describe the fourth hole, for example, as being <i>par</i> five.</p><p class="long">If a golf course is par sixteen, it takes a really good golfer about sixteen strokes to get her ball into the final hole. From the sports meaning of <i>par</i>, it's come to also mean "average" or "equivalent," especially in phrases like "under <i>par</i>," or "worse than expected," and "<i>par</i> for the course," or "what is normal given the circumstances." This definition actually came first, in the form of the Latin <i>par</i>, "equal."</p></div></div>`;
