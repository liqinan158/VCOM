If your friend is behaving strangely but insists she has a reason for it, you could ask her to <i>enlighten</i> you.</p><p class="long"><i>Enlighten</i> comes from the metaphor that ignorance is a state of being "in the dark," and that knowledge is illuminating. We use <i>enlighten</i> as a verb meaning to clear up, to remove confusion. Light is also a powerful metaphor for spiritual insight. If you have a great revelation about the divinity of the world, you could say you have been enlightened. The era known as the "Age of Reason" is also called the Enlightenment.</p></div></div>`;
