var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">festive</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Festive</i> describes an event that’s full of joy, smiles, and excitement. A birthday party without presents, decorations, or friends would be the opposite of <i>festive</i>.</p><p class="long">People having a great time — that’s a sure sign that the occasion is festive.  An awesome party, New Year’s Eve, the last day of school, Fridays: happy times where the air feels electric, that’s festive.  It can also describe your mood, like when you feel full of energy and ready to dance.  Sharing the same Latin root (<i>festivus</i>) as the words <i>festival</i> and <i>feast</i>, festive events often involve good food and great people.  And a piñata always helps.</p></div></div>`;
