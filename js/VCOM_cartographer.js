The <i>cartographer</i> is the person you should thank for getting you un-lost — the mapmaker.</p><p class="long">A <i>cartographer</i> is a person who creates maps, whether they’re of the world, the local bus routes, or buried pirate treasure. It comes to us from the Latin word <i>charta-</i>, which means “tablet or leaf of paper,” and the Greek word <i>graphein</i>, meaning to write or draw. These days, a cartographer doesn’t have to work on paper––it's all computers, making electronic maps as part of GPS software. Technically, a cartographer can make charts, too.</p></div>`;
