If something is pure evil, then it is <i>wicked.</i> Think Darth Vader. On the other hand, as an informal slang term, <i>wicked</i> also means excellent â€” as in "that DJ is <i>wicked</i>, man!" Go figure.</p><p class="long">Other shades of meaning for <i>wicked</i> include something that is playful or enjoyably malicious. Someone might have a wicked sense of humor, for example, meaning it's fierce and takes aim sharply at its victims. Or it can also mean something that, while not actively evil, is still extremely unpleasant. Exams can be wicked, and so can someone's temper or the weather. The word comes from the Old English term <i>wicca</i> meaning "wizard."</p></div></div>`;
