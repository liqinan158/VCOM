You can also use the adjective <i>lucid</i> to describe your mind or thoughts when you're thinking in a rational, sensible way: "I was worried about my grandmother's confusion yesterday, but she seems really lucid today." Another meaning is "translucent," or "letting light shine through" â€” which makes sense since <i>lucid</i> comes from the Latin <i>lucidus</i>, "light or clear," with its root of <i>lux</i>, "light."</p></div></div>`;
