If you convince your brother that your dad ate the last of the ice cream, but you're actually the guilty one, that's a <i>snow job</i>.</p><p class="long">If you tell a long, elaborate lie, especially one that's meant to hide evidence of some mistake or crime, you're pulling a snow job. This informal North American term is simply another way to say "cover-up" or "misrepresentation." Most of the wrongdoing that happened during the Watergate scandal of the 1970s involved the snow job that followed the initial crimes. <i>Snow job</i> comes from World War II army slang.</p></div>`;
