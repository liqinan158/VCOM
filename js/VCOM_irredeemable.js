You could describe your aunt whose house is so full of stuffed animals that the door barely opens as an irredeemable hoarder, or your friend's cheap jewelry as irredeemable junk. It comes from the word <i>redeem</i>, which is related to <i>redemption</i>, whose root word is the Latin <i>redimere</i>, "buy back."</p></div></div>`;
