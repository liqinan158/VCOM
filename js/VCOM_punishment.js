A teenager's <i>punishment</i> for missing her curfew might be helping her dad clean the garage.</p><p class="long">When someone is officially penalized for a mistake or a crime, that's punishment. Stealing a car could result in a punishment involving jail, while pinching your little sister might mean a punishment as mild as sitting in a chair and thinking about ways to be nicer next time. The Latin root of <i>punishment</i> and its related verb, <i>punish</i>, is <i>punire</i>, "punish, correct, take vengeance for, or cause pain for some offense."</p></div>`;
