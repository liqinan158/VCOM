Movie theaters and performing arts theaters can have marquees, as can hotels and many other buildings. <i>Marquee</i> can also describe a person with a starring role, almost always preceding the word <i>player</i>, like when you describe the most well-known member of your local mime troupe as your "marquee player."</p></div>`;
