When a dam breaks during a flood, it causes an <i>onrush</i> of water and you better have your raft at the ready.</p><p class="long">You can talk about an onrush of sea water spilling over the side of a ship, or the onrush of military troops into a newly seized area, or an onrush of gale force winds during a hurricane. You can also use this noun figuratively, to describe emotions that rise very suddenly: "An <i>onrush</i> of grief made his eyes fill with tears." <i>Onrush</i> probably grew out of the verb phrase "rush on" in the 1840s.</p></div>`;
