A person can also be admirable, like your uncle who works building schools in Sri Lanka. If you admire someone for a good reason, that makes them admirable, or deserving of your respect and admiration. When you pronounce <i>admirable</i>, you stress the first syllable, <i>ad</i>, unlike <i>admire</i>, which has the emphasis on the last syllable, <i>mire</i>.</p></div></div>`;
