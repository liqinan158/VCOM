Caught up in the <i>entrepreneurial</i> spirit, you felt like a modern-day pioneer braving the wild frontier of business.  Then you ran out of lemonade.</p><p class="long"><i>Entrepreneurial</i> is the adjective form of the noun "entrepreneur," someone investing in risky financial situations. The base noun can be traced to the Latin <i>prendere</i>, "to take," and the 19th Century French <i> entrepreneur</i>, "one who undertakes or manages." It often involves a risky undertaking, however, including the possibility of losing everything. The 19th-Century English Physicist Michael Faraday once broke it down this way: “The five essential entrepreneurial skills for success are concentration, discrimination, organization, innovation and communication.”</p></div>`;
