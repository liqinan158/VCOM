You could take the left fork and see where it leads, or you could choose the path that goes to the right.</p><p class="long">Whenever there is an alternative, it involves a choice. A wealthy student has the choice of going to a public school, or the alternative, a private school. <i>Alternative</i> can also refer to a different way of doing things, outside the norm. You might say that a hermit who lives in remote a cave with a pet turtle is living an alternative lifestyle.</p></div></div>`;
