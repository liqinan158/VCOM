Your <i>acquisitiveness</i> might get you into trouble if you don't have a huge salary.</p><p class="long">Acquisitiveness is almost always mentioned in a negative light, as in the acquisitiveness of a greedy child on Christmas morning or the acquisitiveness of your friend who cares about nothing but shopping. The noun acquisitiveness comes from Latin acquirere, or "accumulate," so if you're obsessed with accumulating more and more, you can blame it on your acquisitiveness.</p></div>`;
