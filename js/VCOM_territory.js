Countries defend their <i>territories</i> during wars and dogs mark their <i>territory</i> in the yard by peeing on it.</p><p class="long">Although the territory of a country includes its entire area, the noun can also specifically refer to an area governed by a country, but one that isn't a state or province. Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States, for example. The noun <i>territory</i> can also be used to describe any assigned region or area, such as a salesman whose territory is the Midwest â€” that means that he's in charge of business in there.</p></div></div>`;
