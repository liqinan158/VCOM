Jazz musicians are masters of improvisation, creating saxophone solos off the top of their heads based on what they feel in the moment.  The Latin word <i>improvisus</i> means “unforeseen,” and improvisation happens when you can’t see the end goal but you keep moving ahead, dealing with obstacles in a creative way.</p></div></div>`;
