Some computer fans make a <i>continuous</i> noise — a constant buzz — that can drive you to distraction.</p><p class="long">Continuous things don’t stop, not even for a coffee break. A continuous sheet of ice has no cracks, a continuous noise never pauses, and a continuous line of railroad is the kind you want if you’re on a train. <i>Continual</i>, on the other hand, is used to describe things that start and stop occasionally. Use <i>continuous</i> for anything that goes on and on.</p></div></div>`;
