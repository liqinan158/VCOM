You might spend your days hauling <i>loads</i> of hay into a barn and your evenings dragging <i>loads</i> of dirty clothes into the laundry room.</p><p class="long"><i>Loads</i> need to be picked up and hauled somewhere, like a load of firewood in a pickup truck or a load of supplies in a hiker's backpack. There are figurative loads too â€” the responsibility, hardship, or worry that you carry around with you: "Her teaching <i>load</i> is light, which is good because her sick cat is a heavy <i>load</i> on her mind." As a verb, <i>load</i> means "fill," like when you load your lunch box with Twinkies.</p></div></div>`;
