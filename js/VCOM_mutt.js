Your beloved <i>mutt</i> might be as big as a Golden Retriever but with short, Corgi-like legs.</p><p class="long">Most dogs are mutts, and many of their owners are fine with the word <i>mutt</i>, despite the word's original implication of "inferior, mixed breed dog." Dogs called <i>crossbreeds</i> are deliberately bred to combine characteristics of two or more recognized breeds, while mutts — also known as <i>mongrels</i> — are the result of accidental mixing of breeds. In the late 1800s, <i>mutt</i> was a derogatory term meaning either "stupid person" or "stupid dog."</p></div>`;
