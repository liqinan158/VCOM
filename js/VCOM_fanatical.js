The root word is <i>fanum</i>, or "temple." The original English meanings of both <i>fanatic</i> and <i>fanatical</i> implied that the person being described was insane with enthusiasm, like a religious zealot. The word <i>fan</i> is likely shortened from <i>fanatic</i>, and thus shares the same roots, but that word doesn't imply the same obsessiveness that <i>fanatical</i> does.</p></div></div>`;
