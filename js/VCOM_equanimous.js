You might be equanimous about some things, remaining calm when your dog barks or your smoke alarm goes off, but less equanimous about others. Many philosophies and religions, including Buddhism and Hinduism, emphasize the importance of striving to be equanimous. The word is related to <i>equanimity</i>, both from the Latin <i>aequanimis</i>, "mild or kind," or "even minded."</p></div></div>`;
