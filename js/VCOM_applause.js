(Of course, sometimes <i>applause</i> just means the audience is glad it’s time to go home.)</p><p class="long">Back in ancient Rome, actors requested applause from the audience by declaring “Plaudite!” This fact sheds light on the origin of <i>applause</i> — and it definitively proves that performers have been seeking approval from audiences for millennia. Oddly enough, however, it’s considered inappropriate to applaud between the movements of a piece of classical music, regardless of how much you enjoyed the performance. Some concertgoers choose to defy this rule, in spite of the nasty looks they get from neighbors.</p></div></div>`;
