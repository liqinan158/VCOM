If you don’t care one way or another, you’re <i>apathetic</i>.</p><p class="long">The Greek word <i>pathos</i> describes a type of emotional suffering that afflicts people who are super sensitive to their environment.  <i>Pathos</i> is a root word of <i>apathetic</i>, but the prefix <i>a</i>- turns it into the opposite: emotional boredom, insensitivity, and a lack of enthusiasm.  Maybe you feel apathetic because nothing around you stirs your interest, or maybe it’s because you need some coffee.</p></div></div>`;
