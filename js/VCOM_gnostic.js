If the word has a capital "G" — <i>Gnostic</i> — it describes something related to Gnosticism, a form of nonconventional mystical Christianity that emerged in the 2nd century and is still considered heretical by many Christians. Used more broadly <i>gnostic</i> can describe something that has mystical knowledge, especially related to spirituality.</p></div></div>`;
