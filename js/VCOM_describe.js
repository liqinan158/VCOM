"Since we can't come to Paris with you, please <i>describe</i> it in your letter!"</p><p class="long"><i>Describe</i> is from the Latin word <i>describere</i> which means  "to write down." When you <i>describe</i> something, you're "da" <i>scribe</i>, the person writing things down! Writing teachers love to have students <i>describe</i>, using lots of details using the five senses and figurative language. It doesn't have to be written down, though â€” you can also <i>describe</i> that gold dress you saw to your friend on the phone. Or you can <i>describe</i> a circle, by sketching it out with a stick in the sand.</p></div>`;
