The word <i>popinjay</i> isn't used much these days, which is too bad â€” it could describe plenty of people who talk too much.</p><p class="long">A popinjay is a person who's both talkative and cocky, who struts around chattering like a parrot. Fittingly, it's also an old-fashioned word meaning <i>parrot</i>, and the name of a sport also known as pole archery, in which players shoot at wooden bird shapes with either rifles or crossbows. The origin of <i>popinjay</i> is unknown, but one guess is that its roots are imitative, meant to sound like the cry of a bird.</p></div>`;
