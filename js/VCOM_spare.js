If you have a <i>spare</i> tire for your bike you can replace a flat, and if there's enough change in your pocket you can <i>spare</i> some to patch a friend's tire.</p><p class="long">As a noun, a verb, and an adjective, the word <i>spare</i> has many meanings. A leftover part is a spare, you can spare a life when you save an animal or person, and you have spare time when you finish a project early. If you "spare no expense" you spend lots of money and when you spare a friend's feelings, you keep upsetting details to yourself. And if you have a moment to spare, you have time to share.</p></div></div>`;
