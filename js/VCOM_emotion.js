We feel many different emotions every day, like love, fear, joy and sadness — just to name a few. On its own, <i>emotion</i> means "the expression of feeling," like a musician who plays with great emotion, or an actor whose face conveys emotions, even when he or she is just standing quietly on the stage.</p></div></div>`;
