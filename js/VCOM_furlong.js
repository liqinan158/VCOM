It takes eight <i>furlongs</i> to make a mile. These days, the measurement is mainly used to mark distances in horse racing.</p><p class="long">Furlongs were once a common way to measure farmland, with one furlong being the length of a furrow in a 10-acre field. This use dates back to Anglo Saxon times. Furlongs still appear on highway signs in Myanmar. Some modern cities, including Chicago and parts of Salt Lake City, have 800 address units for every mile, making each city block a furlong in length.</p></div>`;
