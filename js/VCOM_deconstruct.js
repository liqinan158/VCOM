Proving that a written text isn't what it initially seems to be is one goal of someone who deconstructs in this way â€” a graduate student might deconstruct "The Wizard of Oz," for example, and declare that it's actually an allegory for nineteenth century economics, rather than a children's story.</p></div>`;
