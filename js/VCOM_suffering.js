The Latin roots that give us <i>suffering</i> and related words paint a vivid picture of what suffering feels like. The word comes from <i>sub-,</i> meaning "below," and <i>ferre,</i> "bear." Suffering is something pressing you down that you have to submit to and bear. It's definitely the opposite of fun.</p></div></div>`;
