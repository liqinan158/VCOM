If you think you've broken your arm after a fall at the roller rink, you may need to see a <i>radiologist</i>.</p><p class="long">A radiologist can x-ray your arm or leg and get a picture of the bones inside. Other tools available to radiologists include CT scans, MRIs, and ultrasound. These are all imaging techniques, and the word <i>radiologist</i> comes from the radiation that x-rays and CT scans use to create an image (from the Latin <i>radiationem</i>, "a shining"). Instead of radiation, ultrasounds use sound waves and MRIs use magnetic fields and radio waves.</p></div>`;
