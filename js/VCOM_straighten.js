When you uncross your legs and stretch them out in front of you, you straighten them. And if you adjust a picture on the wall so it's perfectly level, you straighten it. In the the 14th century, the equivalent verb was <i>straight</i> â€” so in those days, your mom would have said, "Straight your bedroom before you go out with your friends!"</p></div></div>`;
