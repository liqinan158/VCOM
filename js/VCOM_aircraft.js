Airplanes and helicopters are two types of <i>aircraft</i>.</p><p class="long">Some kinds of aircraft, primarily helicopters, use rotors or spinning blades to fly, while the lift of other aircraft comes from jet engines or the shape of the aircraft's wing. Still other aircraft, including hot air balloons, use buoyancy — generally a gas that's lighter than air — for lift and flight. Balloons were actually the first vehicles referred to as <i>aircraft</i>, along with airships. The word was adapted from nautical terminology.</p></div></div>`;
