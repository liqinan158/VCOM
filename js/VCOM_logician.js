An expert in logic is a <i>logician</i>. Spock, a Star Trek character, is the ultimate <i>logician</i> â€” when asked why not, he answers, "Because it isn't logical."</p><p class="long">A logician examines statements to decide whether they are true and is active in the fields of math and computer science. A very simple example of what a logician does can be given with the word <i>or</i>. What exactly does it mean if you say "A or B?" A logician would say that it can mean: 1. A but not B, 2. B but not A, or 3. A and B (this sounds weird but in logic this is true). <i>Or</i>, however, does not mean "not A and not B." Logicians usually deal with much more complex ideas and statements than this.</p></div></div>`;
