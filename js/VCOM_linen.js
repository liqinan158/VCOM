If you're going to a summer wedding, you should consider wearing a white <i>linen</i> suit. If you're going on a job interview, it's probably not such a great idea.</p><p class="long">Linen is frequently used in summery dresses and shirts, curtains, bags, pillowcases and sheets, towels. and tablecloths. It's heavy and substantial but stays breathable and fresh when you wear it on a hot day. <i>Linens</i> is sometimes used to mean "bedding or towels," or the things you'd keep in a linen closet. <i>Linen</i> comes from the Old English word <i>linin</i>, "made of flax," from <i>lin</i>, "flax fibers or linen thread."</p></div>`;
