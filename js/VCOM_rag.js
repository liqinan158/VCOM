You might use a <i>rag</i> to dust the bookshelf or scrub the bathtub, but you wouldn't want to wear one.</p><p class="long">If your clothes are torn and dirty, they're also rags, and from the sense of "worthless scrap," trashy or low quality newspapers have also long been called <i>rags</i>. A rag is also a somewhat annoying joke, and to rag someone is to annoy or harass them. The phrase "from <i>rags</i> to riches" describes a classic and deeply satisfying storyline: the tale of a poor person who becomes gloriously rich.</p></div>`;
