Most little kids have a bit of a <i>lisp</i> when they first start speaking.</p><p class="long">If you speak with a lisp, you can also say that you tend to <i>lisp</i> — and if you lisp in a way that makes it hard for people to understand what you're saying, you can visit a speech therapist who will teach you to speak without a lisp. Sometimes dental work — braces, or a mouth that's numb from having cavities filled — can give you a temporary lisp. <i>Lisp</i> comes from the imitative Old English <i>wlisp</i>.</p></div>`;
