I warned you that repeated <i>misuse</i> of your cellphone would break it â€” I can't believe you were texting in the shower!</p><p class="long">You can use this word as a noun or a verb, with just a slight change in pronunciation. As a noun, <i>misuse</i> rhymes <i>moose</i>. But when you misuse the money your parents gave you for groceries, spending it all on candy and comic books, <i>misuse</i> rhymes with <i>confuse</i>. A less-common meaning of the verb is "treat someone badly."</p></div></div>`;
