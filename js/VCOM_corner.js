Rooms and streets have <i>corners</i> too. If a child misbehaves in class, the teacher might make him stand in the <i>corner.</i></p><p class="long">The key to a corner is that it leads in two directions: when you look at the corner of a room, you could hang a picture to the right or left of the corner, but not in the corner itself. A street corner usually has a street sign and sometimes a bus stop, too. A square table has four corners, but a round table doesn't have any corner. Notice how when you look straight at a corner, there's nowhere to go? That's why <i>corner</i> is also a verb. If you say, "I <i>cornered</i> him," it means you trapped him and gave him nowhere to turn. Whenever we don't see a lot of options, we feel cornered.</p></div>`;
