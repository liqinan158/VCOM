When you have cirrhosis, tissues become thickened, inflamed, or simply deteriorate. This term often appears in the fuller and somewhat redundant form <i>cirrhosis of the liver</i>. <i>Cirrhosis</i> has no relatives in modern English and is derived from a Greek color word: <i>kirrhos</i>, orangish-brown, which is the typical color of the cirrhotic liver.</p></div>`;
