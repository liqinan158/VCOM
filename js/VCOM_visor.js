The visor actually covers your eyes, much like sunglasses. Many motorcycle helmets have a visor, and so do some police helmets and football helmets. As with sunglasses, the visor restricts your vision in some ways, so it's the kind of thing you would only want to use if the sun is blinding.</p></div></div>`;
