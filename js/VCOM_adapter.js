You might need an <i>adapter</i> to connect your cellphone to a computer.</p><p class="long">Computers, televisions, and cameras are just some of the devices that often require adapters to be charged or used in different ways. One common kind of adapter makes it possible to put a two-pronged plug into an outlet with three holes. A different way to use the word <i>adapter</i> is for a person who changes — or adapts — one work of art to fit in a different medium, like an adapter who writes an opera based on a comic book.</p></div></div>`;
