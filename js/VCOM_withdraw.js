You might <i>withdraw</i> money from the bank or <i>withdraw</i> yourself from an argument if it gets out of hand.</p><p class="long">The word <i>withdraw</i> comes from Middle English and still means to draw or take back, like if you withdraw your hand when youâ€™re done holding hands with someone. A newer definition of <i>withdraw</i> is to stay away from others or stop participating in something. You might withdraw from society by holing up in your house, or withdraw from school by dropping out. Another way to withdraw is to promise to do something but then change your mind.</p></div></div>`;
