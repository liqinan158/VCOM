If you're wise and witty, your <i>cleverness</i> is likely to make school a breeze.</p><p class="long">It takes cleverness to solve a tricky logic problem, and it takes a slightly different kind of cleverness to tell a joke really well or come up with a funny response. When a person is <i>clever</i>, they're either very smart and quick-thinking, or they're witty. The meaning of <i>cleverness</i> has evolved over time, including meaning "attractiveness" and "agreeableness" in some dialects.</p></div></div>`;
