If you’re a superhero, your <i>sidekick</i> helps you fight crime.

Sometimes this word signifies an imbalance of power, though; if you say, “This is my <i>sidekick</i>, Sarah," it implies that Sarah has less authority than you do. The origin of this word is unknown, but we do know that it appeared after the terms <i>side-pal</i> and <i>side-partner</i> fell out of fashion.</p></div></div>`;
