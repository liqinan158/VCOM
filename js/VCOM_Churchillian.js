Even more Churchillian, though, is an excellent public speaker, especially one who has the ability to get the audience energized and cheering. Churchillian political orators are skilled at electrifying listeners the way Winston Churchill did during his famous "we shall fight on the beaches" speech in 1940.</p></div></div>`;
