The sentence “When Spencer and Susanna <i>encounter</i> a bear on the trail, they stand very still” illustrates the verb form. “The <i>encounter</i> in the subway left her wishing she had stayed at home” shows the noun form. Whether acting as a verb or a noun, the word carries the connotation of “chance meeting." You don’t plan an encounter; it just happens.</p></div>`;
