A magician changing a dove into a bouquet of flowers also performs a transfiguration. The word shows up frequently in religious writing as well, describing a more spiritual kind of change. In fact, the origin of <i>transfiguration</i> is mostly religious. While the Latin root, <i>transfigurare</i>, means "change the shape of," <i>transfiguration</i> was first used in English to mean "the change in appearance of Christ."</p></div>`;
