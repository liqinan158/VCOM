var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">timberline</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The highest point on a mountain where trees can grow is known as a <i>timberline</i>. Above the <i>timberline</i>, it's much too cold and windy for anything but small, shrubby plants to stay alive.</p><p class="long">The timberline is sometimes called a "tree line" or "forest line." From far away, this point on a mountain can appear abrupt, but up close it's clear that as the altitude increases, the size and number of trees gradually decreases. Near the timberline, trees become stumpy and more shrub-like. In addition to lower temperatures and gusty winds, there is less air and moisture above the timberline â€” all factors that make it a hostile environment for trees.</p></div></div>`;
