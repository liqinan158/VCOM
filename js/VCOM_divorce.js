It’s more permanent than a separation and involves a legal process. If you get a <i>divorce</i>, that means the marriage is officially over.</p><p class="long"><i>Divorce</i> has both a noun and a verb form. The noun describes the thing you get — "you are getting a <i>divorce</i>." And the verb describes the thing you do — "you are <i>divorcing</i> your spouse." <i>Divorce</i> can also be used more broadly to describe any major separation. You might know of a politician who divorces himself from a controversial issue — that means he doesn’t want to be associated with it at all.</p></div>`;
