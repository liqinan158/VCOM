Instead of yelling "Cut it out!" the new neighbor asked the tween girls to desist from playing any more loud, screeching music from that long-haired boy-band.</p><p class="long">If you want to insist that someone stop doing something, the word <i>desist</i> is a solid choice. It's often used as part of a legal order called a "cease and desist," which forces an action to come to a halt. "Cease" is a synonym for <i>desist,</i> so using the two together says "stop it!" loud and clear — and kind of redundantly. "If she will <i>desist</i> from camping on the lawn in front of the star's Hollywood home, she won’t be arrested."</p></div></div>`;
