Thinking about buying your sweetheart something for Valentine's Day? A <i>jeweler</i> can show you some beautiful rings.</p><p class="long">You might also visit a jeweler to get your jewelry repaired, or to buy a fancy watch. We've been making and wearing jewelry, small decorative ornaments, for just about as long as humans have existed. Today, when we want to buy jewelry, particularly expensive or fine pieces, we visit a jeweler. Both words stem from <i>jewel</i> and its Latin root, <i>jocus</i>, which can mean "that which causes joy."</p></div></div>`;
