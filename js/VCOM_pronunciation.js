Sometimes you can tell where someone is from by their <i>pronunciation</i> of certain words. <i>Pronunciation</i> is one of the hardest parts of learning a new language.</p><p class="long">Reading a language and speaking it are two very different things. If you know French but your pronunciation of French words is wrong, French people won’t understand you. In English, the pronunciation of some words varies, depending on where people are saying them. For example, Americans say “tomato,” and the Brits say “tamahto.” The word <i>pronunciation</i> comes from the difficult-to-pronounce Latin root <i>pronuntiationem</i>, which means “act of speaking” or "a proclamation.”</p></div>`;
