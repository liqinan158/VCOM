If you have a big bowl of spaghetti, then you can say that you have "<i>oodles</i> of noodles."</p><p class="long">Use the informal <i>oodles</i> when you mean "lots," "tons," or "bunches." If you grow up to have oodles of money, you can buy a huge house with oodles of space for the oodles of puppies you plan to adopt. Of course, you also imagine having oodles of dog nannies to take care of the puppies and clean up after them. <i>Oodles</i> is an American English word that first turned up in nineteenth century Texas.</p></div>`;
