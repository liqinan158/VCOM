In order to find our way home, we should be <i>oriented</i> toward the north.</p><p class="long">You can be <i>oriented</i> towards or away from all sorts of things, not only geographic ones. For example, if you like sports, you might be called sports-oriented. If politics is your thing, then you're politically oriented. For millennia, people have used the North Star to orient themselves, because it's always in the same place in the sky.</p></div></div>`;
