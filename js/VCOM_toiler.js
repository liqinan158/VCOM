Any employer would be grateful to have <i>toilers</i> as employees.</p><p class="long">If you know that <i>to toil</i> is to work hard, then the meaning of <i>toiler</i> won't be a surprise. A toiler works strenuously; you won't see a toiler hanging out by the water cooler. People with physical jobs such as construction workers and miners are often referred to as toilers. However, if you work long hours at anything — such as being a writer or a lawyer — you're a toiler.</p></div></div>`;
