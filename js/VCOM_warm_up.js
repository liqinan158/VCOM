To <i>warm up</i> is to literally make something warmer, so you can also <i>warm up</i> your soup.</p><p class="long">You can warm up beside a cozy fire after skiing, or warm up in your chilly house with a mug of hot tea. Or, warm up your car by running the engine for a while before you drive. If youâ€™re shy, it might take you a little while to warm up to people. A band warms up by playing parts of songs and tuning their instruments, and an athlete might warm up with an easy jog and some stretching.</p></div></div>`;
