When there's a wide expanse of open ocean, you can see the slight <i>curvature</i> of the earth right where it meets the horizon.</p><p class="long">A curvature is the shape of something that's curved â€” and both words stem from the Latin <i>curvare</i>, "to bend." In math, the term <i>curvature</i> has several specific meanings depending on its context, but it basically comes down to a curving or bending away from a straight line. The curvature of your movie theater seat might make it particularly comfortable, while the curvature of your spine as you work on your computer may give you a backache later.</p></div></div>`;
