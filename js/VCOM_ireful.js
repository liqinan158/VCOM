You'll probably be <i>ireful</i> when you realize that your little brother used your favorite dress shirt as an apron when he baked brownies.</p><p class="long">The word <i>ireful</i> is an uncommon, old-fashioned way to say "really angry." You may tend to be an ireful driver, yelling and gesturing at other cars, or you might write an ireful letter to the editor of a newspaper after reading a badly reported, inaccurate story. When you're ireful, you're <i>full</i> of <i>ire</i>, which comes from Latin and means "wrath, anger, rage, or passion."</p></div>`;
