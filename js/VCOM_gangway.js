After all that flooding, we may have to build a wooden <i>gangway</i> to get across the muddy field to the chicken coop.</p><p class="long">The planks rescue workers use to scale the rubble from an earthquake are one type of gangway. Another is the corridor you walk down as you board an airplane or a cruise ship. And the platforms connecting two train cars are also called gangways. This word stems from an old-fashioned definition of <i>gang</i>, "a going, journey, way, or passage." In the early 20th century, <i>gangway</i> was also a common command meaning "clear the way!"</p></div>`;
