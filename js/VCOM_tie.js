Some games, like chess, can actually end in a tie, but other games, like basketball, continue until there's a winner. You can also use the word <i>tie</i> as a verb: "Looks like the game will <i>tie</i> at two apiece." As a verb, <i>tie</i> also means to fasten two or more things together, like when you tie your shoelaces or your tie.</p></div></div>`;
