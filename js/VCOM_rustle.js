Walking home late at night, you hear a rustle behind you. Maybe it’s just leaves, but you’re spooked, so you rustle around in your knapsack, searching for a weapon. You turn, and it’s just a hungry friend, so you bring him home and rustle up some food from your cupboards. As your friend leaves, he rustles all your cows and takes them away.</p></div></div>`;
