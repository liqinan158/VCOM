The meaning is in the word – it’s the “before” you’re “able” to “see.”  You might be so mad at your sister that you tell her you won't drive her to school for the foreseeable future — in other words, you can't, at this point, imagine a time when you'll be willing to give her a ride.</p></div></div>`;
