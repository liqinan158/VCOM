Politicians running for office tend to <i>re-emphasize</i> the same points over and over....and over again.</p><p class="long">When someone re-emphasizes a point or idea, they've expressed it at least once before, and now they're accentuating its importance. You could complain about potholes by calling the city hotline, and then re-emphasize your unhappiness with the roads by writing a letter to the editor of your local paper. <i>Re-emphasize</i> adds the "again" prefix <i>re-</i> to <i>emphasize</i>, from the Greek <i>emphasis</i>, which was used in rhetoric to mean "significance" or "indirect meaning."</p></div>`;
