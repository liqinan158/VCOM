A <i>logarithm</i> is the exponent that will yield a certain number. For a base of 3 to produce 9, the <i>logarithm</i> would be 2.</p><p class="long">Every number has a logarithm that — if it were an exponent — would produce a certain number. For example, let's say the base is 5. The logarithm to produce 25 would be 2, because 5 times 5 is 25. If the base is 10, the logarithm to produce 10000 would be 4. The logarithm is also called the log. Scottish mathematician John Napier coined the word by using the Greek <i>logos</i> for "word or ratio” plus <i>arithmos</i> for  "number.”</p></div>`;
