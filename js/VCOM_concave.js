They are used to describe gentle, subtle curves, like the kinds found in mirrors or lenses.</p><p class="long">A valley is a <i>concave</i> curve, a mountain is a <i>convex</i> curveâ€”you can remember this by thinking that things that vex you tend to stick out, and that caves tend to be holes that go in, like valleys or innie belly buttons. If you want to describe a bowl, you might say there is a large blue spot on the center of the <i>concave</i> side.</p></div></div>`;
