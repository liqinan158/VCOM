An <i>elective</i> course in school is one you take because you want to rather than to fill a particular requirement, although you still get credit for it.</p><p class="long">You can take elective classes in high school or college. In fact, the word <i>elective</i> is sometimes used as a noun, to mean "optional class." Also, if someone has elective surgery, that means he’s getting an optional operation, like a nose job or a face-lift. In either case, nothing is required or compulsory — it's a free choice. The word comes from the Latin <i>electivus</i>, by way of <i>eligere</i>, "pick out or select," which is also the root of <i>election</i>.</p></div></div>`;
