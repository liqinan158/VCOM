You might say, "My brother is six years my <i>senior</i>," especially if you want to make him feel old.</p><p class="long"><i>Senior</i> means "older," but it also means "old or aged," like your grandmother, who despite being a senior citizen, continues her skydiving hobby. A senior is also a student in the final year of either high school or college, or an authority: "She holds a <i>senior</i> position in the State Department." The Latin word <i>senior</i> means "older," and it's the basis of respectful terms in many languages, like <i>se√±or</i> in Spanish and <i>sire</i> in French.</p></div>`;
