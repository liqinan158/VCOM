With a <i>jack</i>, you can lift the car slightly off the ground and change the tire.</p><p class="long">Most cars have an emergency jack in the trunk, and repair shops have larger jacks, sometimes called "garage <i>jacks</i>," that can raise the car high enough for a mechanic to work underneath it. To lift this way is to <i>jack</i> something. Other kinds of jacks include game pieces and playing cards. In Middle English, as now, the name <i>Jack</i> was used for "ordinary guy," a meaning that transferred to basic tools, generic men, and male animals.</p></div></div>`;
