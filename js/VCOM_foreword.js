A foreword is usually written by someone other than the author and it gives information about the critical reception of the book, personal history of the author, or some other extra detail of interest to the reader. The word <i>foreword</i>  combines <i>fore</i>, "before, or first" and <i>word</i>, and it's closely connected to the German word for "preface," <i>Vorwort</i>.</p></div>`;
