var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">mar</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>mar</i> is a flaw, mark, or blemish, like a deep scratch on a wooden table. As a verb, to <i>mar</i> is to make such an imperfection â€” like the pen mark that <i>mars</i> your crisp, white shirt.</p><p class="long">We often think of things that mar as immediately noticeable, like scratches, scars, and blemishes, but sometimes <i>mar</i> describes other ways of ruining something. For example, an unexpected run-in with a difficult person can mar your relaxing day at the beach, just as an unpleasant memory can mar a peaceful state of mind. The thing to remember is, it only takes one scratch, one mean comment, or one negative experience to mar something that is otherwise fine.</p></div></div>`;
