Most Americans can trace their <i>genealogy</i> back to Europe, Africa, and Asia, but that's not a hard and fast rule.</p><p class="long">The first clue to the meaning of the word <i>genealogy</i> is in the root "gene," as in "passed on through the genes." Add to that the suffix <i>-logy</i>, which means "study," and you get <i>genealogy</i>, the study of one's origins. While some folks are eager to understand their genealogy, others prefer to forget their family history. But these days, knowing one's genealogy can have real advantages, especially medical: knowing your genetic history can help you maintain your health.</p></div></div>`;
