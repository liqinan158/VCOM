And the act of being chosen for the part? Well, they were <i>cast</i> by the director. That's showbiz for you.</p><p class="long"><i>Cast</i> also refers to various types of actions a person can take: if you throw out a fishing line in a particular way, you are said to cast it; if you fancy your chances in Vegas, you cast the dice at the craps table. And if you break a limb and they bandage it up in solid plaster for your friends to write all over? That, too, is a cast.</p></div></div>`;
