When something (like a book or a song) is under copyright, it's not in the public domain. People who want to use these materials have to pay a fee to copy parts of the book or record a new version of the song. Eventually a copyright expires, which puts the work into the public domain. A good example of this is the song "Happy Birthday," which is now in the public domain â€” you can officially sing it without paying a fee.</p></div>`;
