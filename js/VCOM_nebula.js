A <i>nebula</i> is sometimes the birthplace of stars, such as the Orion <i>Nebula</i> where new stars — a youthful million years old — are still forming.</p><p class="long">Another example of a nebula is the Crab <i>Nebula</i> — the glowing result of a supernova, noted by Chinese astronomers in 1054 CE. It spans about 10 light-years in length. In biology, a <i>nebula</i> may be a cloudy formation in the eye, or a cloudiness of urine. It also refers to a medicinal preparation put in a nebulizer. When you are talking about more than one nebula (which is probably not that often for the average person), say <i>nebulae</i>.</p></div></div>`;
