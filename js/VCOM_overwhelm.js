var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">overwhelm</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Overwhelm</i> means “give a person too much of something.” If your friend agrees to feed your pet fish while you’re on vacation, don’t <i>overwhelm</i> her with requests by also asking her to do your laundry and wash the dishes.</p><p class="long">While it’s easy to be overwhelmed by chores or complaints, it’s also possible to be overwhelmed by good things — if they occur in large quantities. You might enjoy a stack of pancakes for breakfast, but you'd probably find a truckload of pancakes overwhelming. Sometimes people feel overwhelmed by emotion, and this can be a positive or negative experience, depending on the emotion. For example, you might feel overwhelmed by gratitude if your friend takes excellent care of your fish, but overwhelmed with grief if the fish is accidentally flushed in your absence.</p></div>`;
