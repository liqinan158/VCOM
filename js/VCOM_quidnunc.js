The neighborhood <i>quidnunc</i> is the person who seems to always know everyone's business.</p><p class="long"><i>Quidnunc</i> is archaic â€” it's hardly ever used these days. It's too bad, because it's a fun way to describe a busybody or rumormonger. You can call your nosy friend a quidnunc, or tell your dad, "Don't be such a <i>quidnunc</i>!" when he snoops in your room. <i>Quidnunc</i> was coined in the 1700s, combining the Latin words <i>quid</i>, "what," and <i>nunc</i>, "now," and mimicking someone who might constantly ask, "What's happening now?" or "What's the news?"</p></div>`;
