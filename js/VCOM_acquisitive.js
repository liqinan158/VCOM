Someone who's <i>acquisitive</i> is preoccupied with possessing material things.</p><p class="long">If you were trying to improve yourself by becoming less acquisitive, you might destroy your credit cards and force yourself to take a break from buying things. The adjective <i>acquisitive</i> comes from Latin word for "accumulate," <i>acquirere</i>, so when you're consumed with accumulating more and more, you can describe yourself as <i>acquisitive</i>. It's an easy word to confuse with <i>inquisitive</i>, which means "curious or inquiring." It's much better to be inquisitive than acquisitive!</p></div></div>`;
