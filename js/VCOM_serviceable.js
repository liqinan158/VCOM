On the other hand, you might long for a beautiful pair of leather boots despite having a serviceable pair of rubber galoshes. <i>Serviceable</i> was spelled the same way in Old English, although it originally meant "willing to be of service," and only later came to mean "usable or useful."</p></div></div>`;
