It can also be a verb; to <i>correct</i> wrong answers is to adjust them to make them right.</p><p class="long">The origin of <i>correct</i> can be found in the Latin word <i>regere</i>, "to guide," which became <i>correctus</i> as the past participle of <i>corrigere</i>, meaning "to straighten."  When you correct your posture, you sit up straight.  Sometimes when your cell phone tries to correct your spelling you can end up with some amusing sentences.</p></div></div>`;
