It can stand in for "okay," like the sandwich you had for lunch that was just <i>alright</i> â€” it was neither great nor terrible.</p><p class="long">In a nutshell, <i>alright</i> means "fine" or "satisfactory": "Are the kids alright on that Ferris wheel?"  You can use it to show that you agree with something someone said: "Oh <i>alright</i>, I get it."  This one-word spelling of "all right" is okay when texting with your friends, but don't use it when you are looking to impress, such as in a thank-you letter following a job interview.</p></div></div>`;
