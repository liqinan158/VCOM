The headmaster is often in charge of discipline as well as the running of the school. It's common these days to use the term <i>head teacher</i> rather than <i>headmaster</i>, since it includes both male and female principals. The word <i>headmaster</i> has been around since the 1570's.</p></div></div>`;
