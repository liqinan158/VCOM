A dog trainer is most likely <i>unqualified</i> to perform brain surgery.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>unqualified</i> is good for describing someone who isn't fit for a task or job. You wouldn't want an unqualified dentist to fill your cavity, and an unqualified babysitter might not even know how to change a diaper or put a bandage on a scraped elbow. Another way people can be unqualified is when they lack some necessary document â€” you're unqualified to teach in a public school, for example, without a state teaching certificate.</p></div>`;
