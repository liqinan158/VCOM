(Actually, they shouldn't be approached at all). Delivering bad news is done warily. People drive warily on ice, and they walk warily on ice, too. When you're acting warily — in other words, being <i>wary</i> — you're worried about what could happen, so you're careful and you take precautions.</p></div>`;
