Inductive reasoning is a way to make sense of things by making specific observations and then drawing broad conclusions based on those observations. For example, if you break out in hives every time you eat something with buckwheat flour but youâ€™re fine eating other types of flour, you might use inductive reasoning to conclude you get hives from the buckwheat flour.</p></div></div>`;
