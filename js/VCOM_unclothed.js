It's fine to be <i>unclothed</i> when taking a bath, but modern society generally frowns on <i>unclothed</i> people going about their daily routines.</p><p class="long">If you're unclothed, you can also say you're naked or nude, or that you're wearing your birthday suit. Most of us encounter far more clothed people than unclothed in a typical day, but there are plenty of places where it's fine to be unclothed, like locker rooms, your own shower, or in a doctor's exam room, for example. Visit an art museum and you'll also encounter unclothed figures â€” in paintings and sculptures.</p></div></div>`;
