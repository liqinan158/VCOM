When you throw a party, you hope your friends will describe it as <i>rollicking</i>.</p><p class="long">Parties with live music and great food are usually rollicking, and a wonderful game of charades with your family can also be rollicking. You might even describe a funny movie or a song you can dance to this way. The root of <i>rollicking</i> is a nineteenth century verb that we don't use much these days, <i>rollick</i>, "to behave exuberantly." It, in turn, is most likely a combination of <i>frolic</i> and <i>roll</i>.</p></div></div>`;
