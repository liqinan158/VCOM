If you're undergoing surgery, you'll need <i>anesthesia</i> to ensure you don't feel any pain during the procedure.</p><p class="long"><i>Anesthesia</i>, pronounced "an-es-THEE-zhuh," comes from the Greek word <i>anaisthetos</i>, meaning "without sensation." There are two kinds of anesthesia: local anesthesia numbs just part of your body, like when a dentist numbs your mouth before filling a cavity. General anesthesia makes you unaware and free of all sensation, like when you are having your spleen removed. The medication that causes the lack of sensation is called an <i>anesthetic</i> and the person who administers an anesthetic is an <i>anesthesiologist</i>.</p></div>`;
