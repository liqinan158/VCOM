You'll probably feel <i>dizzy</i> for a while when you get off the whirling tea cup ride at the fair.</p><p class="long">Some people feel dizzy when they're up high, either on a ladder or at the top of a tall building or bridge. Others only get dizzy when they're coming down with the flu or after riding on the merry-go-round at the park. Another way to be <i>dizzy</i> is to be silly or frivolous: "I can't take him seriously, he's just so <i>dizzy</i> all the time." <i>Dizzy</i> comes from the Old English <i>dysig</i>, "foolish or stupid."</p></div>`;
