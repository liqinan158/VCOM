Itâ€™s how dogs become stray and children become orphaned. If <i>abandonment</i> is your greatest fear in life, make sure to surround yourself with loyal friends and treat them kindly.</p><p class="long"><i>Abandonment</i>, a noun meaning "relinquishment," stems from the French <i>abandonnement</i> and was first recorded in the early 17th century. "Life, misfortunes, isolation, <i>abandonment</i>, poverty, are battlefields which have their heroes; obscure heroes, sometimes greater than the illustrious heroes," said Victor Hugo. He treats a person's survival of abandonment with the utmost respect, perhaps more than that accorded survival of war or other more obvious trials.</p></div>`;
