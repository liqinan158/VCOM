That's what you call a <i>soliloquy</i> — a speech made by a character in a drama as if that character is voicing their own private thoughts. Shakespeare's plays are full of <i>soliloquies</i>.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>soliloquy</i> comes from the Latin roots <i>solus</i> ("alone") plus <i>loqui</i> ("speak") — so the word literally means "an act of speaking to oneself." A soliloquy is a dramatic speech that reveal's a character's inner thoughts and reflections. Some of the most famous lines in drama are taken from soliloquies. Hamlet's famous "To be or not to be" speech is a soliloquy, for example.</p></div></div>`;
