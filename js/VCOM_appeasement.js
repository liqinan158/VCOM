A candy bar might give your hunger temporary <i>appeasement,</i> but eventually you'll need a real meal.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>appeasement</i> comes from the verb <i>appease,</i> which itself comes from the French words <i>a</i> ("to") and <i>pais</i> ("peace"). We wouldn't use appeasement to talk about deep inner calm, but rather satisfying demands, or bringing a turbulent situation back to calm, and in a way that often meets with disapproval. The ransom of $50,000, for instance, is an appeasement for the kidnappers.</p></div></div>`;
