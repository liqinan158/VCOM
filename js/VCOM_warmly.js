To smile <i>warmly</i> at a shy child is to present a sincere, friendly face in his direction.</p><p class="long">People who treat others warmly are enthusiastic and cordial. When teachers answer their students' questions warmly, they act with a kindness that tends to make the students happier and more excited about school. <i>Warmly</i> comes from the adjective <i>warm</i> and its meaning of "showing affection or kindness." This sense has been in use since the 1500's, but the Old English root word, <i>wearm</i>, relates only to literal heat or warmth.</p></div></div>`;
