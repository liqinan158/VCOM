There are heroines in regular life too, like womenâ€™s rights activists who fight against sexism, or a brave mother who rescues her child from a burning building.  <i>Heroine</i> sounds the same as the addictive drug <i>heroin</i>, but a heroine will save your life, while heroin will probably end it.</p></div></div>`;
