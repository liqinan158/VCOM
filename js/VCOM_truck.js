A <i>truck</i> is a motorized vehicle on wheelsâ€”it's like a car, but bigger. <i>Trucks</i> are often used for hauling or transporting things.</p><p class="long">What we call a <i>truck</i> in the U.S. is generally called a <i>lorry</i> in the U.K. Trucks vary in size from small pickups that aren't much larger than cars to 18-wheel semi-trailer trucks. These big trucks are built to transport heavy goods and are mostly powered by diesel fuel. <i>Truck</i> is also a verb, meaning "convey by truck" or "proceed leisurely." The Middle English root word means "wooden wheel."</p></div>`;
