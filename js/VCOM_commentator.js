If you want to hear opinions on the news rather than the news itself, listen to <i>commentators</i>.</p><p class="long">A reporter delivers the news and a commentator analyzes it, sometimes within the same news program. If you're a top sports commentator, you may become an even bigger household name than the players you are discussing, and you may pull in just as much money too. Political commentators, who often offer more opinion rather than analysis, are also sometimes called pundits or talking heads.</p></div>`;
