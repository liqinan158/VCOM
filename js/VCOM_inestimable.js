It can describe physical size (the <i>inestimable</i> universe) or a degree of something (your <i>inestimable</i> handsomeness with that new haircut).</p><p class="long">The prefix <i>in</i>- means “not,” and <i>estimable</i> has the same root as the word <i>estimate</i>, which means "to take an educated guess."  Sometimes a thing is so great that you cannot even guess.  A tsunami causes inestimable destruction.  You’d need to travel inestimable miles to reach the edge of the universe.  The love you have for your pet raccoon is inestimable, but the number of times she gets into your trash every week is quite estimable.</p></div></div>`;
