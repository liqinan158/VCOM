Not all seizures are caused by epilepsy, but an epileptic seizure occurs when a strong electrical disturbance occurs in the brain. The severity and intensity of the seizures depend on many factors and are unique to each person. It may be possible to control seizures through medication, although not everyone with epilepsy will respond to medication. People with uncontrolled epilepsy should not drive.</p></div>`;
