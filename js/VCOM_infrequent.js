You'd probably be glad to have infrequent run-ins with mean dogs or ugly insects, but disappointed to get infrequent phone calls from your best friend. The adjective <i>infrequent</i> comes from the prefix <i>in</i>, which here means "not," and <i>frequent</i>, or "often," which is rooted in the Latin word <i>frequentem</i>, "crowded or repeated."</p></div>`;
