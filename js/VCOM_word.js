But if you ask "What's the <i>word</i> on that restaurant?" you're asking for an opinion. You can also "give your <i>word</i>," but that means that you're promising something; you're giving an oath. If your friend asks what you think of his girlfriend, you may want to word your response carefully — to watch your words.</p></div></div>`;
