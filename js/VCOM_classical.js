Be careful when using <i>classical</i> and <i>classic</i>; they're not exactly the same. While something classical is usually a classic, it doesn't necessarily work the other way around. A classic is something  exceptional that we tend to judge in a different time frame. A classic rock album? Definitely not made by the ancient Greeks or Romans. So far as we know.</p></div>`;
