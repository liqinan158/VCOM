Fairy tales are typically full of magic spells, princesses, talking animals, evil queens, witches, and goblins. Disney would probably not be in business if it weren't for fairy tales. You can also use the word to describe some part of real life that seems almost magical, like a "<i>fairy tale</i> romance."</p></div></div>`;
