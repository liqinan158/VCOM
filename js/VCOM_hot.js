This could mean a <i>hot</i> day in July, a baseball team on a <i>hot</i> streak, or a <i>hot</i> bikini model.</p><p class="long">Most meanings of <i>hot</i> have to do with heat: what makes us sweat. A stove can be red hot. Spicy food is hot, and newspapers used to be "<i>hot</i> off the presses" because the printing process actually warmed the paper. New things are often referred to as <i>hot</i> — like a hot new band. Stolen property is also called hot because you can't hold onto it too long or it will burn you — though perhaps not in the usual way.</p></div></div>`;
