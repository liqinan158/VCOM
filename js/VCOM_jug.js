Other jugs are made of clay or glass. In some countries, beer comes in a jug, and in others water is collected and carried in a jug. Earthenware jugs can actually be played as musical instruments, often in a jug band â€” the player blows across the opening and holds the jug at different angles.</p></div>`;
