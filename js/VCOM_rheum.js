It’s not the word you’d use in everyday speech, though. You wouldn't say, "My allergies are really acting up. Please excuse the rheum streaming down my face." But you might use the adjective <i>rheumy</i> to describe your dog's runny eyes or even your own. The word comes from the Greek <i>rheuma,</i> meaning "a stream, or current."</p></div>`;
