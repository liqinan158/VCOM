Spies during World War II sometimes communicated using <i>cyphers</i>.</p><p class="long">If you use a cypher to send your friend a message, it may take her a while to figure out what you're trying to tell her. Some cyphers substitute numbers or symbols for letters, and you need a key to decipher — or interpret — them. Another kind of <i>cypher</i> is an unimportant person who's blank or devoid of personality — you might call a lifeless character in a book a cypher. The word has an Arabic root, <i>sifr</i>, "zero, empty, or nothing."</p></div>`;
