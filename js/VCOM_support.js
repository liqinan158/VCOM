If you build a house with blocks, you can safely remove some of them, but if you remove one that is <i>supporting</i> the weight of the blocks above it, the whole structure can collapse. Timber!</p><p class="long">If you agree with or approve of a cause, person, idea, or the like, you support it. If you support a certain charity, you may donate your time or money to the cause. The verb <i>support</i> also means to strengthen with new evidence; to corroborate. When politicians make an argument, they <i>support</i> it by providing "facts and figures." Your job is to figure out whether their evidence has been twisted to support their positions. Good luck.</p></div>`;
