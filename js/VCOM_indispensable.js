If you have asthma and you're packing for summer vacation, your inhaler is <i>indispensable</i>, unless you enjoy gasping on the beach.</p><p class="long">Something that is <i>dispensable</i> is something you could get rid of, like that box of yogurt-covered zucchini snacks that's been in the pantry for a year. So if something is indispensable you couldn't possibly go without it, like salt, or for some people, coffee. Chocolate is indispensable for chocolate chip cookies, as is furniture for the adult hide-and-go-seek league.</p></div></div>`;
