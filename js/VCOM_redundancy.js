As much as you hate the <i>redundancy</i> of math drills, you have to admit that repetition is how you learned to multiply in the first place.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>redundancy</i> can also refer to something that is unneeded, or extra. If you own a circus and you want to keep costs down by eliminating redundancy, you may decide you only need two clowns, rather than the whole carload of clowns you planned on. <i>Redundancy</i> comes from the Latin word <i>redundare</i>, meaning to surge, or literally to overflow.</p></div>`;
