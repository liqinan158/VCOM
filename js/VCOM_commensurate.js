Many people think the death penalty is a <i>commensurate</i> punishment for murder. In other words, the penalty fits the crime.</p><p class="long">When things are commensurate, they're fair, appropriate, and the right size. If you got a ticket for jaywalking, you shouldn't get ten years in prison â€” that penalty is not commensurate with the crime. The word <i>commensurate</i> is usually followed by <i>with</i> or <i>to</i>; one thing is commensurate with or to another.</p></div></div>`;
