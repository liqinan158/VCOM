Long, snarled hair is hard to comb through, and snarled shoelaces can slow down even the most energetic kindergartener. It works figuratively, too, when things are impeded or stuck: "The <i>snarled</i> traffic made her an hour late to her meeting." <i>Snarled</i> probably comes from <i>snare</i> and its Scandinavian root meaning "twisted cord."</p></div></div>`;
