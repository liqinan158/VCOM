Flutes, clarinets, and oboes are all <i>woodwinds</i>. So are bagpipes—but you might have a hard time convincing your music teacher to let you play bagpipes in the marching band.</p><p class="long">Most woodwinds have a mouthpiece with a thin strip of material called a <i>reed</i> that vibrates when air passes. Blowing into a saxophone or clarinet is different than blowing across the opening in a flute or piccolo, but they're all woodwinds. Each requires <i>wind</i>, or a stream of blown air, to play notes. While today most woodwinds are made from metal and other materials, the original woodwinds were wooden—which explains the <i>wood</i> part of the name.</p></div></div>`;
