Your grandparents love their new kitten so much that they don't even mind her clawing holes in their <i>damask</i> curtains.</p><p class="long">The word <i>damask</i> comes from <i>Damascus</i>, the Syrian city where this kind of fabric was originally made â€” it literally means "cloth from Damascus." Damask was one of the main styles of weaving during the early Middle Ages, and it has been a popular choice for fancy clothing, table coverings, and home decor ever since. Today some damask is made of synthetic material, but historically it was most often made from silk.</p></div></div>`;
