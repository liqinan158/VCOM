It could just as easily be “<i>Cupidity</i> is good,” though admittedly it doesn’t roll off the tongue quite the same way. <i>Cupidity</i> means a burning desire to have more wealth than you need.</p><p class="long">Though it sounds like it might have something to do with the little winged figure who shoots arrows and makes folks fall in love on Valentine’s Day, <i>cupidity</i> is all about the love of money. It comes to us from Latin <i>cupidus</i>, which means "desirous." It’s not a word that crops up a lot in conversation, though you might run across it in newspapers and magazines, particularly those blaming Wall Street’s unbridled cupidity for America’s economic woes.</p></div></div>`;
