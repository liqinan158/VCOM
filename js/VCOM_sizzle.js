Drop pieces of bacon in a hot pan and they'll <i>sizzle</i>.</p><p class="long">A grilled cheese sandwich sizzles in melted butter, and veggie burgers sizzle on a hot grill. You can also use <i>sizzle</i> in a figurative way, when it's so hot that you feel  like food in a hot pan: "I'm not going to the pool today, I'll <i>sizzle</i> in the heat." This verb dates from about 1600, and it probably comes from the imitative Middle English <i>sissen</i>.</p></div></div>`;
