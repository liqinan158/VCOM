While it can be hard to show objectivity about people or pets, it's easy to be more "objective" about objects. I can show objectivity about a box of rocks; it's much harder to show it with my dog. The opposite of <i>objectivity</i> is "subjectivity," which is personal bias or opinion.</p></div></div>`;
