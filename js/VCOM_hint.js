Your mother might <i>hint</i> at the fact that she doesn’t like your shoes, while your grandmother will just come right out and say that they’re ugly.</p><p class="long">If you’re a journalist following a lead, you’ll prefer that your source give you all the facts, rather than just a hint. A hint can be an indirect suggestion and it is also a very small amount — maybe you take just a hint of sugar in your coffee. As a verb, <i>hint</i> is an intimation or subtle suggestion. It’s also something you drop, like when you hint that you want a particular video game for your birthday.</p></div>`;
