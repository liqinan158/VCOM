If your friend spends most of his time sighing, moping, and crying, he's probably <i>dysphoric</i> — and you should probably see if he wants to talk.</p><p class="long">Euphoria is a state of extreme happiness, and dysphoria is the opposite: it’s a negative feeling, especially about life in general. When someone is full of dysphoria, they’re dysphoric: unhappy. Being dysphoric is a lot like being depressed. If you are familiar with the Winnie-the-Pooh stories by A. A. Milne, then you know Eeyore — a dysphoric donkey.</p></div>`;
