Parents might feel an ineffable sadness and pride when watching their youngest child graduate from high school. <i>Ineffable</i> can also be used to describe a name that is so sacred you’re not allowed to say it.This word comes from the adjective <i>effable</i>, which means “something that can lawfully be expressed in words,” and isn’t used much anymore.</p></div>`;
