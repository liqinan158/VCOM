From this smaller representative group, the poll predicts how a much larger group of people would answer: this percentage or number is a guess, and the range of that guess (like, "between 27 and 31 percent of voters dislike this candidate's hair style") is the margin of error. The smaller the margin of error, the more accurate a calculation or statistic is considered to be.</p></div></div>`;
