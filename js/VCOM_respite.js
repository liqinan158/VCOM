If you're cramming for exams, take an occasional walk to give yourself a <i>respite</i> from the intensity.</p><p class="long"><i>Respite</i> may look like it rhymes with <i>despite</i>, but this word has a stress on its first syllable (RES-pit).  It comes from the Latin word <i>respectus</i>, meaning refuge, but we almost always use <i>respite</i> to describe a time, not a place, of relief. If you've been fighting with your partner, a visit from a friend might offer a brief respite from the argument, but the fight will pick up again when she leaves.</p></div></div>`;
