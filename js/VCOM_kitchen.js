Restaurants have <i>kitchens</i> too, but only the <i>kitchen</i> staff hangs out in there. A <i>kitchen</i> is a room that’s meant for cooking.</p><p class="long">Whether you're making a four-course meal or microwave popcorn, the kitchen is where the magic happens. Schools, hospitals, and restaurants have kitchens. The word <i>kitchen</i> can also be used as an adjective. Guess where the kitchen cabinets are? If someone says you’ve packed everything but the kitchen sink, your suitcase is overflowing. And you should totally go back and get that sink. The Old English root of <i>kitchen</i> is from the Vulgar Latin <i>cocina</i>, rooted in <i>coquere</i>, "cook."</p></div>`;
