A little girl might be scolded for not having <i>ladylike</i> manners if she puts her feet up on the table at a fancy restaurant.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>ladylike</i> is an old-fashioned way to describe how a dignified or "proper" woman acts. Your grandmother might praise your best friend's ladylike demeanor, not knowing that in her spare time she drives a demolition derby car and is usually covered with mud. Before <i>ladylike</i> was first used in the sixteenth century, the equivalent adjective was <i>ladily</i>.</p></div>`;
