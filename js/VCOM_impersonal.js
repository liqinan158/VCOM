An impersonal rejection is easier to take than one that specifies precisely why you, in particular, are a reject. But if your class is so impersonal, your teacher doesn't even know your name, that’s not good. A wedding that doesn't include details about the bride and groom would be impersonal and maybe more like a business meeting than a celebration. <i>Impersonal</i> comes from the Latin roots <i>in-</i> (or <i>im-</i>), "not," and <i>personalis,</i> "of a person."</p></div></div>`;
