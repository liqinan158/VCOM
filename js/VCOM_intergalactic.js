An <i>intergalactic</i> star, for example, is not inside a galaxy, but between them — it's also called a "rogue star."</p><p class="long">You can call anything that relates to galaxies, or exists between them, <i>intergalactic</i>. If we were able to travel at the speed of light, intergalactic travel — travel from one galaxy to another — might be possible. The prefix <i>inter-</i> means "between" or "among," and it's followed by <i>galactic</i>, "pertaining to our galaxy," from the Late Latin root <i>galaxias</i>, "the Milky Way."</p></div></div>`;
