An attacking army might storm through a village and <i>reave</i> from all of the houses in it.</p><p class="long">You can use the verb <i>reave</i> when you need an antique way to say "plunder" or "pillage." Someone who reaves is basically stealing things, although the word implies the sense of a group stealing many items after an attack, as in wartime. The Old English root word is <i>reafian</i>, which means "to rob, plunder, or pillage," from the Proto-Indo-European <i>reup</i>, "to rip."</p></div>`;
