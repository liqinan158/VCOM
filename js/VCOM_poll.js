When people go to the <i>polls</i>, they vote.</p><p class="long">If you poll your classmates about their favorite foods, you survey them and take note of their opinions â€” in other words, they each cast a vote. This is also what happens when voters go to the polls, although they're voting for political candidates and their votes are anonymous. The original fourteenth century meaning of <i>poll</i> was "hair on the head" or just "head." This gradually evolved into "person," and the idea of "counting heads."</p></div>`;
