Although you aren't fond of Aunt Martha, you always manage to give her a warm <i>welcome</i> when she comes to visit.</p><p class="long">When you accept someone into your home courteously, especially upon arrival, you <i>welcome</i> them. When you visit your grandparents, they welcome you with open arms and a plate of homemade cookies. They might even shout, "<i>Welcome</i>!" when you walk in the door. <i>Welcome</i> also means to gladly accept.
