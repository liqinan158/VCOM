An <i>extempore</i> dance party on the city bus might be fun, while an <i>extempore</i> speech in front of the whole school could be terrifying.</p><p class="long">The term <i>exetempore</i> comes from the Latin phrase <i>ex tempore</i>, "out of time," and was originally used to mean "without time to prepare." These days it usually comes up when a performer is improvising or a speaker goes off script or doesn't use a teleprompter: "The President's extempore remarks made his advisors nervous." You can also use the synonym <i>extemporaneous</i>.</p></div>`;
