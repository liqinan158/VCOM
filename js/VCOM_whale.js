Blue <i>whales</i> are the largest animals that ever lived â€” they're even bigger than the largest dinosaurs were!</p><p class="long">The Old English root of <i>whale</i> means both "whale" and "walrus," although these two marine animals are quite different from each other. While some whales grow to be only ten feet long, many whales are enormous. The informal phrase "a whale of a" comes from the idea that whales are impressive, and you can use it for things (or people) that really distinguish themselves: "Wow, this is a whale of a party!"</p></div>`;
