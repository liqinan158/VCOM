When you're walking in the woods and face a <i>divergence</i> in the path, you have to make a choice about which way to go.</p><p class="long">A <i>divergence</i> doesn't have to be a physical split â€” it can also be a philosophical division. The divergence of opinion between a school board and a group of parents might cause such a heated argument that the students at the meeting are obviously better behaved than the adults. <i>Divergence</i> can also mean a deviation from standards or norms, like the divergence between your state's smoking laws and those of your neighboring states.</p></div></div>`;
