You might also say, "Shoot, I always seem to <i>chip</i> my nails."</p><p class="long">You can use the word <i>chip</i> as a noun or a verb, to describe the breaking off of a small piece or the small piece itself. You might accidentally chip your aunt's favorite tea cup, or realize that slamming your door made a chip of paint fall off your bedroom wall. The word comes from the Old English <i>forcippian</i>, "to pare away by cutting," and the related <i>cipp</i>, also pronounced <i>chip</i>, which means "small piece of wood."</p></div></div>`;
