For example, if you renovate a room you may make it "new again" with structural changes, such as tearing down walls and altering its original design. If you refurbish it, however, you will most likely focus on making it look better with cosmetic changes, such as painting it. The word <i>refurbish</i> is also often used to describe secondhand technology that has been rebuilt to restore function by replacing a component that has failed.</p></div></div>`;
