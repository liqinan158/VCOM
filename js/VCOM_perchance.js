Perchance thinking of a French poet such as Baudelaire will help you remember the definition. People use this word when they’re unsure of something, and they want to sound fancy. If you say, “<i>Perchance</i> it will rain,” you’re not sure about the chance of rain, and you might be wearing a chapeau. Use the word <i>perchance</i> if you like to kick it old school.</p></div></div>`;
