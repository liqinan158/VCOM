You're almost always going to see <i>fourfold</i> accompanied by the word <i>increase</i>. For example, making class sizes smaller and school days longer might result in a fourfold increase in test scores. Or sticking to your pledge of not buying fancy coffee drinks could lead to a fourfold increase in available pocket change each week.</p></div>`;
