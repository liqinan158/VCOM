That is actually a <i>lichen</i>, a complex organism comprised of a fungus and its partner algae, the two parts interweaving to form one.</p><p class="long">The word <i>lichen</i> appeared around 1600, and was drawn from the Greek <i>leikhÄ“n</i>, meaning "what eats around itself." This is a good meaning for what the word represents, as lichen is comprised of fungus cells that literally surround the algae cells to form a mutualistic bond. Because of the crusty look of a lichen, the name has also been given to a number of skin diseases that present the same patchy look as the fungus-algae.</p></div>`;
