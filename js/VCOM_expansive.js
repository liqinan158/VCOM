An <i>expansive</i> piece of land is large, an <i>expansive</i> mind is one that is always thinking of the big picture, an <i>expansive</i> vocabulary is one that holds lots of words.</p><p class="long">Warning: don't confuse <i>expansive</i>, "large," with <i>expensive</i>, "high priced." They differ by only one letter but mean very different things. A Big Mac may contain what McDonald's advertizes as an expansive all-beef patty, but it isn't expensive food.</p></div>`;
