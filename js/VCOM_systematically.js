You might systematically memorize every word in the dictionary, starting with <i>A</i> and working your way through the alphabet, or watch a toddler systematically pick up one Cheerio at a time from his bowl and throw it on the floor. <i>Systematically</i> and <i>systematic</i> come from a Greek root, <i>systematikos</i>, or "combined in a whole."</p></div>`;
