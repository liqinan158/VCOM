Oranges are easy to share because they are naturally <i>sectioned</i>.</p><p class="long">Anything that's split into sections, or that has specific areas set apart from each other, is <i>sectioned</i>. For example, a sectioned theater might be divided into the orchestra, the mezzanine, and the balcony. A sectioned chicken is split into parts before it's sold or served â€” wings, breast, and thigh. The adjective <i>sectioned</i> comes from a Latin root, <i>sectionem</i>, "a cutting, cutting of, or division."</p></div>`;
