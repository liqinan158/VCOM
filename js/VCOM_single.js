People can be single too, if they aren't attached romantically to another person: "She had a terrible boyfriend, but now she's <i>single</i>." <i>Single</i> can also mean "distinct," or separate from everything else, like when you read every single word of a book to prepare for a test at school. And if you "<i>single</i> someone out," you place the focus on that one person.</p></div>`;
