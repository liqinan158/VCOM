You take an <i>unnecessary</i> risk if you get in the car and don't bother to fasten your seatbelt. Driving your car when you could ride a bike instead is an <i>unnecessary</i> use of gasoline. If you keep dropping you pen in class, your teacher might say, "That's unnecessary." Walking your dog with two leashes is definitely unnecessary. That's obvious, but lots of times it's hard to tell what's necessary and what's unnecessary.</p></div>`;
