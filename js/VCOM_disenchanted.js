Large classes and standardized testing often leads to <i>disenchanted</i> teachers.</p><p class="long">An unsatisfying final episode of a popular TV show's last season will result in disenchanted viewers, and the impression that all the candidates are basically the same means a lot of disenchanted voters. When you're <i>enchanted</i> by something, you're delighted by it. This comes from the Old French root <i>enchanter</i>, "to bewitch, charm, or cast a spell." Adding the prefix <i>dis-</i> gives <i>disenchanted</i> the opposite meaning.</p></div></div>`;
