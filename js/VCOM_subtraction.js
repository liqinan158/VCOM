In other words, the <i>subtraction</i> of two from five gives you an answer of three.</p><p class="long">In school, subtraction is typically the second operation you learn in arithmetic, after addition. When a problem has you take four apples away from eight apples, that's subtraction. If you see the word <i>minus</i>, or the symbol <i>-</i>, that's also subtraction. The word itself comes from the Late Latin <i>subtractionem</i>, "a drawing back or taking away," from <i>subtrahere</i>, "take away," which combines <i>sub</i>, "from under," and <i>trahere</i>, "to pull."</p></div></div>`;
