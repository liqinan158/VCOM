This is a lack of wisdom and sophistication.</p><p class="long"><i>Naivete</i> has four syllables and is pronounced nigh-eve-i-TAY. The root <i>naïve</i> is a French adjective meaning “natural, just born.” Because it suggests innocence or ignorance, naivete is often associated with children, who lack experience and knowledge. But plenty of adults, too, display a certain amount of naivete when they make assumptions based on ignorance, an inability to grasp a situation, or a tendency to oversimplify complex things.</p></div></div>`;
