If you're protected against something, you have <i>immunity</i> to it. Your new silver clothes just might grant you <i>immunity</i> from getting thrown in jail by the fashion police.</p><p class="long">In the late 14th century, the noun <i>immunity</i>, which means “exempt from service or obligation,” developed from the Latin <i>immunitatem</i>, which has nearly identical meaning. Break that word down even further, and you get <i>immunis</i>, meaning “exempt, free,” from <i>in</i> "not" and <i>munis</i>, meaning “performing services.” In a medical sense, <i>immunity</i> is “protection from disease.” Your annual flu shot tries to give you immunity from, or make you insusceptible to, the illness.</p></div>`;
