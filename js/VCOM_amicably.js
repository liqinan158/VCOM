Let's say a couple gets divorced â€” if they parted amicably, then there wasn't a lot of yelling and screaming, and they both agreed to it. You could say two countries that dislike each other had a meeting of their leaders that was conducted amicably: they were polite and said nice things, even though that's not necessarily how they felt.</p></div></div>`;
