If you're looking to avoid buying shoes for your whole life, become a <i>mermaid</i>.</p><p class="long">Mermaids appear in folklore from around the world, from the ancient Greek sirens who were said to lure sailors to a watery death, to the Mami Wata water spirits from African mythology. The Disney version of mermaids comes from the Hans Christian Andersen story "The Little <i>Mermaid</i>," about a mermaid who trades her life in the sea for love with a human. <i>Mermaid</i> means "maid of the sea," from <i>mere</i>, "sea" in Middle English.</p></div>`;
