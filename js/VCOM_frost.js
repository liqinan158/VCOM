During a New England winter, you'll have to scrape <i>frost</i> off your car windshield almost every morning.</p><p class="long">Frost is made of tiny crystals of ice that appear white and tend to form on windows, the ground, trees, and cars. While frost can be lovely on a window, with its snowflake shapes and patterns, it can also be dangerous for farm crops if it forms unexpectedly early or late in the year. <i>Frost</i> comes directly from the Old English, and it has a Proto-Germanic root.</p></div></div>`;
