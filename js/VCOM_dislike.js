var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">dislike</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Put simply, to <i>dislike</i> can be used as a transitive verb that means to "not like."  Maybe you <i>dislike</i> spinach.  But it can also be a noun, as in "You seem to have developed quite a <i>dislike</i> for spinach."</p><p class="long">English being a language of trial-and-error, the word <i>dislike</i> came about in the mid-16th Century, as modern English was still in its infancy. At that time, some words were tried and discarded, to be replaced with others that stuck. That was the case with <i>dislike</i>, which developed after the word "mislike" was dropped as the opposite of "like." Speaking of prefixes, don't confuse the word <i>dislike</i> with "unlike," which means that something is different from something else.</p></div></div>`;
