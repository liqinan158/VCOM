Then you're feeling <i>ardor</i> â€” an intense kind of warmth and fervor most often associated with love.</p><p class="long">The Brits spell <i>ardor</i> with an extra vowel, so you'll often see this word written as <i>ardour</i>. But on either side of the pond it's a noun that brings to mind Pepe Le Pew and his fervent pursuit of the female species. But <i>ardor</i> isn't always about love. It's perfectly platonic to be "an <i>ardent</i> supporter" of a certain cause, or show eagerness and ardor in your approach to anything.</p></div>`;
