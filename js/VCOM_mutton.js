It's not, however, very common to see <i>mutton</i> on a menu.</p><p class="long">Use <i>mutton</i> when you're talking about eating the flesh of a sheep. In the United States, it's more common to dine on lamb, which is meat that comes from a baby sheep, although mutton is a popular dish in other parts of the world. <i>Mutton</i> has been in use since the thirteenth century, from an Old French root word, <i>moton</i>, "mutton, ram, or sheep." In the 1860's, long sideburns called <i>mutton chops</i> were a popular style of facial hair.</p></div>`;
