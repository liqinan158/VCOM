If you can't stop telling jokes, even after your math class has started, your teacher will think you're a <i>goof</i>.</p><p class="long">There are many alternate words for <i>goof</i>, including <i>dimwit</i>, <i>dummy</i>, and <i>nitwit</i>. In other words, you should only call someone a goof if you mean to insult their intelligence. The mistakes a goof — or anyone — makes can also be called <i>goofs</i>: "I made such a <i>goof</i> when I was mixing this cake batter." <i>Goof</i> is a 1916 American invention, probably influenced by the English dialect <i>goff</i>, "foolish clown."</p></div>`;
