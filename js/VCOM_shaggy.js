Your long-haired mixed breed dog might be <i>shaggy</i>, while your sister's sleek Siamese cat isn't <i>shaggy</i> at all.</p><p class="long"><i>Shaggy</i> almost always describes an animal's fur or a person's unruly hair. A well-loved stuffed animal might be soft and shaggy, and your brother's curly hair is especially shaggy when he first rolls out of bed in the morning. On the cartoon "Scooby Doo," Scooby's best friend is a goofy, shaggy-haired guy named Shaggy. <i>Shaggy</i> followed the earlier adjective <i>shagged</i>, from the Old English <i>sceacgede</i>, or "hairy."</p></div>`;
