Most <i>cupolas</i> have the shape of a dome, or even take the form of a small dome on top of a larger dome.</p><p class="long">Although the majority of cupolas are dome-shaped, the small, windowed projection on top of a train caboose is also called a <i>cupola</i>. A raised gun turret on a tank is yet another type of cupola, as is a furnace used for refining metal. The word <i>cupola</i> is Italian, from the Late Latin root <i>cupula</i>, "a little tub," a diminutive form of <i>cupa</i>, "cask or barrel."</p></div></div>`;
