A squaw is a woman, or a Native American wife. Since this is a Native American word, it could easily be considered offensive if used by people who aren't Native Americans, and maybe even if they are. It’s got the double whammy of being a little racist and sexist. You’re better off using a neutral word such as woman or wife and avoiding <i>squaw</i> altogether.</p></div>`;
