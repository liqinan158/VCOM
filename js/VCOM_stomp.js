An angry teenager might <i>stomp</i> down the hall and slam the door to his room.</p><p class="long">A little boy in big cowboy boots might stomp around the house enjoying the sound of his heels against the floor, and an awkward marching band could stomp heavily down the street playing the theme from "Rocky." You can also use the word <i>stomp</i> to describe a specific kind of stamping dance. This meaning has been around since about 1912, from popular jazz slang. The earlier <i>stomp</i> was simply a variation on the word <i>stamp</i>.</p></div></div>`;
