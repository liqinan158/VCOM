Anyone who sells goods to other businesses, rather than directly to customers, is a wholesaler. The bookshop in your town and the big box store in a strip mall are both retailers, buying goods from wholesalers, who sell them large quantities of books or patio furniture that they in turn sell to individual shoppers.</p></div></div>`;
