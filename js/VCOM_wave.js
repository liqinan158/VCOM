A <i>wave</i> that washes up on a beach has the same kind of back-and-forth movement as a crowd of baseball fans doing "the <i>wave</i>" in the stands.</p><p class="long">Use the verb <i>wave</i> to describe a greeting that includes a hand motion, from the enthusiastic flapping wave of a little kid meeting his dad at the airport to the prim wave of a Queen acknowledging her subjects. In physics, when you talk about a sound wave, there is a similar kind of rise and fall. Two Old English root words of <i>wave</i> are <i>w√¶fre</i>, "wavering or restless," and <i>wagian</i>, "to move to and fro."</p></div></div>`;
