Certain things are not <i>visible</i> to the naked eye, but that doesn't mean they are invisible, you may just need a microscope or telescope to see them.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>visible</i> also means obvious to the eye. You'd use this sense if you want to point out obvious flaws in an object such as a car with visible dents and scratches. A third meaning for the adjective is easily available or accessible: You may try to be a visible presence in your kids' lives — although sometimes they would prefer that you blend into the woodwork — so that they know they can count on you and come to you with any problem.</p></div></div>`;
