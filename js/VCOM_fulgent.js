You might talk about the <i>fulgent</i> night sky you can see in the countryside, bright with stars and a brilliant moon.</p><p class="long">The word <i>fulgent</i> is a fairly uncommon one, but it's a perfect way to describe a brilliant or sparkling shine. Sunrise over the ocean can be fulgent, the light reflecting brightly off the water, and a movie star's glittering diamond jewelry might also be called fulgent.
