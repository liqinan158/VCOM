A <i>terrorist</i> may be motivated by religious fervor, politics, or just plain old-fashioned greed.</p><p class="long"><i>Terrorist</i> has at its root the word "terror," which comes from the Latin word <i>terrorem</i>, meaning great fear. Great fear is exactly what terrorists hope to create so they can manipulate the situation to their benefit. The label <i>terrorist</i> is a subjective one. To the British, the American colonists who destroyed shiploads of tea in Boston Harbor in 1773 were terrorists. To colonists, they were patriots and heroes.</p></div>`;
