If your brother is only four feet tall, you should view his claims that he can slam dunk a basketball with a lot of <i>skepticism</i>.</p><p class="long">If you like to poke holes in other people's ideas, then you are full of skepticism. Some people follow a specific belief system that questions the truth of anything, but most people save their skepticism for certain things. Tabloids, Big Foot sightings, and over-eager used car salesmen should all be viewed with a little skepticism. On the other hand, gullible folks believe everything they hear and don't have much, if any, skepticism.</p></div></div>`;
