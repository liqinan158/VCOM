In ancient Greece, dead heroes were sometimes thought of as <i>demigods</i>.</p><p class="long">Greek and Roman mythology have their share of demigods, and so does Hinduism â€” although in the latter case, a demigod is defined as a deity or god who was once mortal. Hanuman, known as the monkey god, is one example of a Hindu demigod who was born human and achieved divinity. The word <i>demigod</i> comes from the roots <i>demi</i>, "half," from the Latin <i>dimidius</i>, and <i>god</i>.</p></div>`;
