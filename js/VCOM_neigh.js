A horse's happy <i>neigh</i> is sometimes a greeting to other horses.</p><p class="long">You can use <i>neigh</i> to talk about the noise your horse makes, also known as a whinny or a bray. <i>Neigh</i> is also a verb: horses neigh cheerfully or in frustration, and your little brother might like to ride a broomstick wildly around the house and neigh. The word comes from the Old English <i>hnægan</i>, which is most likely imitative of the actual sound of a neigh. In other words, it's an example of onomatopoeia — when a word sounds like what it means.</p></div>`;
