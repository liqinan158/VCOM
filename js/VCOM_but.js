If a sentence starts out in one direction, <i>but</i> can change that direction. For example: "I like you, <i>but</i> I never want to see you again."</p><p class="long"><i>But</i> can mean "however," "nonetheless," and "on the contrary" in three little letters. It's English efficiency at its best. <i>But</i> is short but powerful. <i>But</i> is everywhere but never unnecessary. <i>But</i> is never supposed to start a sentence, but sometimes it does. <i>But</i> sometimes means "just," as in: "I'll have <i>but</i> a few of those delicious candies." Grade schoolers might snicker, but the word would need another <i>t</i> to mean your "bottom."</p></div></div>`;
