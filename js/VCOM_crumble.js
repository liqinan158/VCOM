If the doughnuts you bring to work <i>crumble</i> before you get there, you co-workers will have nothing but crumbs to snack on.</p><p class="long">Baked goods seem to crumble easily, but other things tend to crumble too: old houses, over time; sand castles; fragile ruins; and art objects made from clay. Anything that falls apart, especially into small bits, can be said to crumble. The root of the word is the Old English <i>gecrymman</i>, "to break into crumbs," which in turn comes from <i>cruma</i>, "crumb or fragment."</p></div>`;
