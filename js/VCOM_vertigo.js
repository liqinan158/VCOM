However, acrophobia can result in the symptoms associated with vertigo. Interestingly, when legendary director Alfred Hitchcock created a film about a detective with an intense fear of heights, he named the film <i>Vertigo</i>, not <i>Acrophobia</i>; perhaps he thought <i>Vertigo</i> was catchier.</p></div></div>`;
