It is sometimes called an <i>attaché</i> case. You may notice that in spy movies, an <i>attaché</i> is often swapped out by the bad guy, and then the good guy spends the rest of the movie trying to get it back.</p><p class="long"><i>Attaché</i> comes from the French <i>attacher</i>, which literally means "attached," and it was first applied to someone working for a diplomat, such as a junior officer. Now an <i>attaché</i> is a technical expert assigned to the staff of a diplomatic mission. If you are an expert on the customs of a certain country, you may be asked to be a cultural attaché and advice the ambassador for that country.</p></div>`;
