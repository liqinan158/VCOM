A fertilized egg will hatch and the tiny chick will <i>become</i> a full-grown chicken.</p><p class="long">When you become angrier and angrier watching the TV news, you begin to feel a certain way. Likewise, when Pinocchio the wooden puppet becomes a real boy in the fairy tale, he changes from toy to human. The word <i>become</i> can also mean "learn how to be" or "be qualified for," as when you dream that some day you'll become an astronaut. The Old English <i>becuman</i> has these meanings, and also "meet with" or "arrive."</p></div></div>`;
