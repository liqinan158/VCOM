First, if two (or more) people put their signatures on a form or letter, you can say they cosign it. In some cases — particularly when you're applying for a loan — a financial institution will require that you have someone cosign, essentially promising that if you can't repay the loan, he or she will be responsible for it. The word dates from the mid-20th century.</p></div>`;
