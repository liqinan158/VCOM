In other words, it benefits or rewards the person who is doing it.</p><p class="long">You are most likely to come across the word <i>gainful</i> followed by <i>employment</i>. For some reason, most writers use this adjective to describe the working world, and the idea that a job provides a benefit to the worker â€” usually, in the form of money. Occasionally, you'll see other words replace <i>employment</i>, but they will still mean "work." The root of <i>gainful</i> is the Old French <i>gaaignier</i>, "to earn or gain," and also "to work in the fields or cultivate land."</p></div>`;
