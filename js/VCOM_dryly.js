Your friend's <i>dryly</i> humorous comments might be your favorite thing about watching soap operas with him.</p><p class="long">People who joke or remark dryly have a straight-faced delivery, even as they are saying the funniest things. You could also describe a black comedy as being dryly funny, or a character in a book as narrating dryly. The adverb <i>dryly</i> comes from <i>dry</i>, which more commonly means "not wet" than "subtly humorous" â€” although the humor meaning dates from the early 15th century.</p></div>`;
