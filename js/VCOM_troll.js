As a verb, <i>to troll</i> means to wander around. You may have heard of a trolley, which is a vehicle that helps you travel around a city. The word <i>troll</i> more generally refers to anything that repeats itself regularly. You might troll a city, searching for a trolley, or you might troll parts of a song, repeating them one after the other to annoy your neighbors!</p></div></div>`;
