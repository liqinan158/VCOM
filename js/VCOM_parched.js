American Indians parched corn to make it keep and remain edible over the winter. They taught this to the new colonists, and <i>parched</i> corn later became a staple of explorers like Lewis and Clark, as well as soldiers during the Civil War. Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote of parched corn, "It crackled and crunched, and its taste was sweet and brown."</p></div>`;
