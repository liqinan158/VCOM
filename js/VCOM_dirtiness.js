If your parents are constantly complaining about the <i>dirtiness</i> of your room, you might want to stop eating potato chips in bed and leaving your grubby socks all over the floor.</p><p class="long">If dirtiness drives you crazy, you probably sweep frequently; perhaps you've even purchased in a robot vacuum that's constantly rolling around your house sucking up dirt. On a larger scale, if the dirtiness of the oceans is something that concerns you, you might choose to study environmental science so you can try to do something about it. <i>Dirtiness</i> comes from <i>dirt</i> and its Old English root meaning "any foul or filthy substance."</p></div>`;
