You can also use <i>speckle</i> as a verb meaning "to scatter" or "to dot." For example, you could describe the black spots that speckle your cat, or talk about the stars that speckle the sky. <i>Speckle</i> most likely comes from the Old English word <i>specca</i>, "small spot or speck."</p></div></div>`;
