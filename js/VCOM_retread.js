You might love a writer's first book, but you'll still be disappointed if she only <i>retreads</i> the same plot in her second one.</p><p class="long">You can, quite literally, retread your steps through the woods to find the beautiful grove of ferns you saw yesterday. You can also figuratively retread: "That candidate just <i>retreads</i> the same points over and over again!" When a car mechanic uses this word, it means "put new treads on a tire," or as a noun, the new surface of the tire itself. During World War I, <i>retread</i> was Australian slang for a "re-enlisted soldier."</p></div></div>`;
