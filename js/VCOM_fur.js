One downside of having a cat or dog is that you often end up finding their <i>fur</i> all over your house.</p><p class="long">Most mammals have fur, dense soft coats that protect them from becoming too cold or hot. Northern dog breeds, for example, have a double coat of fur, with the dense bottom coat keeping them warm even in the snow. Sometimes <i>fur</i> is used to mean "an animal's pelt" or "clothing made from the fur of an animal." The phrase "to make the <i>fur</i> fly" means "to cause serious trouble."</p></div>`;
