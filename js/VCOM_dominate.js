To <i>dominate</i> means to be in control or have the power to defeat.</p><p class="long"><i>Dominate</i> is related to the word <i>domain</i> â€” which means home. While these words may not seem all that similar, when you are the master of a home or thing, you dominate it. If you get angry, it is wise to not let your feelings dominate you or your actions. <i>Dominate</i> can also mean to be most prominent. If in the woods around your house, oak trees are the most common, you could say that "oak trees <i>dominate</i> the forest."</p></div></div>`;
