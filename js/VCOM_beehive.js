You might find a <i>beehive</i> in a hollow tree.</p><p class="long">If you become a beekeeper, you will either build or buy one or more beehives for your bees to live in. You might wear a protective suit, with a hat and netting that covers your face, when you are cleaning or checking on your beehives, to avoid being stung. Around 1960, the word <i>beehive</i> began being used to refer to a remarkable hairstyle, a round, high teased style that requires plenty of hairspray.</p></div>`;
