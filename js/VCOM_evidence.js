The word <i>evidence</i> shows up frequently in legal documents and dramas, because evidence is necessary proof in linking someone to a crime or crime scene. <i>Evidence</i> is used in many ways to show that something is true, as in "the chocolate stains around your mouth and the crumbs on the table are evidence that you ate the last of the brownies."</p></div>`;
