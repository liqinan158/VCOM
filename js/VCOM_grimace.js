A <i>grimace</i> is a facial expression that usually suggests disgust or pain, but sometimes comic exaggeration.</p><p class="long">Picture someone wrinkling his nose, squeezing his eyes shut, and twisting his mouth and you'll have a pretty solid mental image of a grimace. It can be a verb, as in "the class <i>grimaced</i> at the teacher's suggestion of a pop quiz." Or it words as a noun. "The class gave a <i>grimace</i> when the teacher suggested a pop quiz." Its forerunner was the 17th century Spanish <i>grimazo</i>, meaning caricature, and <i>grima</i>, meaning fright.</p></div>`;
