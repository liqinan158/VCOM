When you stumbled onstage, tripping over your costume and pulling down the backdrop, you brought a <i>farcical</i> element to the serious play.</p><p class="long">If it resembles a farce — a silly comedy that pokes fun at something — you can describe it as <i>farcical</i>, which is pronounced "FAR-cih-kul." <i>Farcical</i> comes from the Latin <i>farcire</i>, "to stuff," which influenced the French <i>farce</i>, a "comic interlude in a mystery play." It's thought that <i>farce</i> came to have this meaning because it was "stuffed" in between acts.</p></div></div>`;
