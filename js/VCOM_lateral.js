"All of the <i>lateral</i> movement in tennis hurt her knees and she had to quit playing."</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>lateral</i> comes from the Latin word <i>lateralis</i>, which means “belonging to the side” and the modern meaning is basically the same. In anatomy, views of the body from the left, as well as from the right  are referred to as <i>lateral</i>. You can make a <i>lateral</i> career move, if the compensation and level of responsibility stay about the same (instead of moving up, you are moving to the side). A <i>lateral</i> pass in football is one that goes to the side or behind the passer, instead of directly towards the goal.</p></div>`;
