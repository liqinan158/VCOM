Unless you've been to certain parts of Asia or Africa, you've probably only seen <i>elephants</i> in zoos and wildlife parks.</p><p class="long">Elephants are the largest animals that live on land. They are spectacular animals, with curved ivory tusks on either side of a trunk that they use for grasping objects, vocalizing, and sucking up water to drink. Elephants are plant eaters that live in tight-knit groups led by females and have a lifespan of around 45 years. The Greek root of <i>elephant</i> is <i>elephas</i>, which means both "elephant" and "ivory."</p></div>`;
