Getting senile is a very serious condition, as an older person might have trouble remembering who their own children are. Many people in nursing homes are senile, because their families aren't able to provide proper care. Of course, people forget things at every age. If you're 10 or 40 and have a bad memory, you're not going senile.</p></div></div>`;
