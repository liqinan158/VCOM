You and your sister might, for example, <i>mutually</i> decide to skip the family reunion.</p><p class="long">You can use the adverb <i>mutually</i> to describe an action or a connection that you share with someone. If you have a mutually competitive relationship with your best friend, it means that both of you feel a sense of rivalry. And when a decision is mutually beneficial to everyone in town, it helps every single person equally. The root word is the Latin <i>mutuus</i>, which means "reciprocal, or done in exchange."</p></div></div>`;
