A batch of muffins might taste weirdly oily when you use too much butter, and the rags lying around a car repair shop are mostly black and oily. Your brother's hair will probably be pretty oily after he refuses to wash it for a month. Since the sixteenth century, <i>oily</i> has also had the figurative meaning of "insincerely flattering or slick," like an oily car salesman.</p></div></div>`;
