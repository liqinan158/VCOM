That's called the <i>denouement</i>, or the showing of how the plot eventually turns out.</p><p class="long"><i>Denouement</i> is a French word that literally means the action of untying, from a verb meaning to untie. The English word is pronounced like the French: day-noo-MON. The last syllable has a nasalized vowel instead of the <i>n</i> sound. You can use it outside the context of plays or novels, too: you might describe the denouement of an argument between two friends.</p></div></div>`;
