When something is unrolling or unraveling, it is doing so gradually, not all at once.  <i>Evolve</i> describes a development that is taking its time to reach its final destination. Think change with a speed limit. Your taste in music evolved from the nursery rhymes you loved as a little kid to whatever you like today. Even places can evolve, like the old-fashioned coffee shops that evolved into Internet cafes as people began to bring their laptops with them.</p></div></div>`;
