Think of it as being something that no reasonable person would even think of doing or saying — something unbelievable, outrageous, and often horrible.</p><p class="long">The word <i>unconscionable</i> is related to the word <i>conscience</i>. Add the <i>un-</i>, and you can see that it refers to something done without applying good moral judgment. The word first appeared in the mid-16th century — presumably everyone up until that time had high scruples and never did or said anything beyond the boundaries of conscience. Sadly, the antonym, <i>conscionable</i>, is rarely used, and, in fact, has been obsolete since the 18th century, though <i>unconscionable</i> remains in frequent use.</p></div></div>`;
