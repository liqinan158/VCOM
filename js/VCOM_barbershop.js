You might visit a <i>barbershop</i> at the beginning of every summer to get a short crew cut.</p><p class="long">While some hair cutters call themselves <i>stylists</i> and the places where they work <i>salons</i>, others are barbers who trim hair and shave necks in barbershops. The most common customer at a barbershop is a man who wants a quick haircut and possibly a beard trim or shave as well. In the 1500's, a barbershop was called a "barbery," from the Latin <i>barba</i>, or "beard." A "<i>barbershop</i> quartet" is a four-person, harmonizing singing group.</p></div>`;
