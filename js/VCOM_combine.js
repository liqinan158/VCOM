In some cases, the different items blend their properties and cannot be divided again, while in other cases the <i>combined</i>  items can be picked out separately.</p><p class="long">In Latin, the prefix <i>com-</i> means "together," and <i>b카n카</i> means "two by two." These were combined to create the word <i>comb카n훮re</i>, or "to unite." Comedian Dave Attell offers a good use of the verb <i>combine</i> (cum-BINE): What're the two things they tell you are healthiest to eat? Chicken and fish. You know what you should do? Combine them, eat a penguin. Hiram Moore's <i>combine</i> (the noun is pronounced COM-bine) was a machine that combined reaping, binding, and threshing into one machine, saving farmers a lot of work.</p></div>`;
