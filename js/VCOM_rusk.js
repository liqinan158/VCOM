You can also serve <i>rusks</i> at a party with cheese or a tasty dip.</p><p class="long">Rusks go through the baking process at least twice. By definition, hard cookies like Italian biscotti and crispy flatbreads like melba toast qualify as rusks, since both are twice â€” baked and have a dry, crisp texture. The term <i>rusk</i> most commonly applies specifically to the hard cookies that teething babies can safely chew on. The word comes from the Spanish <i>rosca</i>, "twist of bread."</p></div></div>`;
