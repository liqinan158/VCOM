Anyone can read a <i>filing</i>.</p><p class="long">As you might imagine, a filing is an example of something being put in a file. You can take part in the physical act of filing by organizing documents in separate files. Or, you can execute a different type of filing by making a legal document public. After a public filing, a document is fair game for anyone to read, including members of the media. Another type of filing is produced from filing a metal. If you are filing away at your iron gate, for example, you will create iron filings. Best not to inhale those!</p></div></div>`;
