If you remark that your friend’s new hair color looks artificial, for example, you’re not paying her a compliment. <i>Artificial</i> can also describe a behavior or expression that seems insincere — much like the smile on your girlfriend’s face if you bring her artificial flowers instead of real ones.</p></div>`;
