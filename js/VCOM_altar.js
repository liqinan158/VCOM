It is prominent in the Bible as "God's table," a sacred place for sacrifices and gifts offered up to God.</p><p class="long">The word <i>altar</i> comes from the Latin <i>altārium</i>, meaning "high," and also to the Latin <i>adolere</i>, which means "to ritually burn or sacrifice," which suggests its early purpose as detailed in the Bible. Nowadays, the altar is the place for non-sacrificial religious rites such as communion or weddings, and is a metaphor for offerings. Comedian Stephen Fry once said, “I am a lover of truth, a worshipper of freedom, a celebrant at the altar of language and purity and tolerance.”</p></div>`;
