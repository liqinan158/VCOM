A <i>maw</i>, you see, is an informal term for a mouth.</p><p class="long">There's something ravenous as well as ferocious about the term <i>maw,</i> and in fact it comes from the Old English word <i>maga</i> meaning "stomach." Occasionally you may find it applied to human rather than animal usage, especially when implying comical greed, as in "he was stuffing cupcakes down his <i>maw</i> as fast as he could." Other colloquial terms for mouth, such as <i>piehole</i>, <i>gob</i> and <i>trap</i> tend to suggest a tone more amused than fearful.</p></div></div>`;
