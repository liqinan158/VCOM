Institutions — such as banks, schools, or hospitals — often join forces and <i>amalgamate</i> with one other. But other things — like musical genres — get <i>amalgamated</i> as well.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>amalgamate</i> original referred specifically to the mixture of metals, now however, it refers to any mixing or blending. A school board might decide to amalgamate two schools into one school due to a decrease in the student population, but amalgamating their mascots would be impossible.</p></div></div>`;
