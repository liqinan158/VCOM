A high school debater might <i>animadvert</i> on the subject of the death penalty, for example.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>animadvert</i> is a great word to use when you need a formal way to talk about a public condemnation of something or someone. A tourist might animadvert upon the entire country of Italy after a disappointing vacation there, or a politician might take advantage of a public forum to animadvert on the issue of high taxes. The Latin root word is <i>animadvertere</i>, "to notice or take cognizance of," or "to censure, blame, or punish."</p></div>`;
