If your best friend is really struggling with her math homework, you might want to <i>proffer</i> her some advice â€” like suggesting that she get a tutor.</p><p class="long">What's the difference between <i>proffer</i> and <i>offer</i>? If you say you proffered something to a friend, it suggests a spirit of generosity and it signals that your friend was welcome to accept or reject it as he saw fit. In other words, <i>proffer</i> is usually a little more polite than <i>offer</i>.  To remember this, think of the following equation: p[oliteness] + offer = proffer.</p></div>`;
