It's also <i>mobilization</i> when you organize your family to throw a surprise party for your sister.</p><p class="long">Preparing a group of people so they're ready to act at a moment's notice is what mobilization is all about. It comes from the verb <i>mobilize</i>, which literally means "to make mobile." Both words have been used in a military context since the 1850s, originally to talk about the Imperial Russian Army and its mobilization at the start of the Crimean War. Before that, <i>mobilization</i> simply meant "rendering capable of movement."</p></div></div>`;
