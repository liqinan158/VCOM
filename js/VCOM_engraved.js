An <i>engraved</i> wedding ring might have the marriage date etched inside it.</p><p class="long">Many metal objects are engraved, from jewelry to sports trophies, silverware to musical instruments. Engraved items are sometimes purely decorative or works of art, while others are marked so they can be identified. An engraved serial number on a gun or a computer, for example, can be helpful if these items are lost or stolen. The root of <i>engraved</i> is the Old English <i>grafan</i>, "to dig or carve."</p></div></div>`;
