When the surface layer of snow or ice turns into fog or steam without melting, this is an example of <i>sublimation</i>.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>sublimation</i> is from the Latin word <i>sublimare</i>, meaning “to raise a higher status.” In the field of mental health, sublimation helps people who have urges that, if acted on, are self-destructive or dangerous to others. They are taught how to direct that energy into something productive like creating art, exercising, or otherwise finding an outlet to take mind off of problematic thoughts.</p></div>`;
