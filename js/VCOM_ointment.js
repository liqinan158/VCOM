You might want to apply a bit of <i>ointment</i> to that festering flesh wound on your forehead. Just saying.</p><p class="long">Ointment is viscous â€” in other words, it's somewhere between a solid and a liquid, with a slippery, oily texture. Some medications come in ointment form, while other ointments might be lip balm, a moisturizer for dry skin, or even a cosmetic. The Old French <i>oignement</i> came from the Latin <i>unguentum</i>, from the stem <i>unguere</i>, "to anoint or salve."</p></div>`;
