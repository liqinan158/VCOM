Imagine putting on your underwear over your pants and you'll see that there's a kind of absurdity in something that's backwards, which is why <i>preposterous</i> came to mean "ridiculous." The word is often used as part of an exclamation: a chef who is asked to cook with nothing but jelly beans might exclaim, "That's <i>preposterous</i>!"</p></div></div>`;
