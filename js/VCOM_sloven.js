It's not a very common word, but it replaces <i>pig</i> very nicely when you're talking about a truly sloppy, unpleasant person. <i>Sloven</i> was first used in the fifteenth century to mean "person with horrible manners." Its origins are uncertain, but it probably stems from either the Flemish <i>sloef</i>, "dirty," or <i>slof</i>, which is Dutch for "careless or negligent."</p></div>`;
