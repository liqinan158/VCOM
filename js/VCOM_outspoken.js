How people view that particular trait in you, however, will depend on whether they agree with what you have to say or not!</p><p class="long">Use the adjective <i>outspoken</i> to describe someone candid and blunt, one who is direct in manner or speech. If you are an outspoken advocate for arts education in schools, you probably attend lots of school board and community meetings trying to ensure that the board does not cut music and drama from the school curriculum. If you are an outspoken critic of the way your boss does his job, you may not have yours much longer!</p></div>`;
