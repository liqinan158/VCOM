If you have a <i>sentimental</i> attachment to a favorite stuffed animal, you'll probably even bring it to college with you.</p><p class="long"><i>Sentimental</i> describes a person who relies on emotions more than reason, or a novel or film that is overly emotional. Derived from the Latin verb, <i>sentire</i> "to feel," <i>sentimental</i> always implies that the emotions are involved a little too much. If you do something for sentimental reasons, you are only doing it because of an emotional attachment.</p></div></div>`;
