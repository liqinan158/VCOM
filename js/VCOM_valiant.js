The 14th-century French origins of the word are "bold" or "of worth," which makes the adjective <i>valiant</i> a good one for describing ordinary people who put all they have into something, making their efforts valiant, even if they fail. The Plymouth Valiant, by the way, was considered a strong and successful car, though <i>valiant</i> usually refers to people.</p></div></div>`;
