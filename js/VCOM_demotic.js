Some forms of the Greek and Egyptian languages are also called <i>demotic</i>, which will be relevant to you when you get your PhD in Classics.</p><p class="long"><i>Demotic</i> comes from the Greek word <i>demotikos</i>, meaning “of or for the common people” or “in common use.” Members of the aristocracy don’t typically use demotic idioms, but it is often the elite who will point out that something is demotic. Of course, in a classless society, everything ought to be demotic, therefore making it obsolete to designate sayings as demotic. So far, however, <i>demotic</i> is still a relevant term.</p></div></div>`;
