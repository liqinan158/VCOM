When your dog <i>licks</i> you, he's saying hello. Humans should opt for waving hello over <i>licking</i>.</p><p class="long">Animal mothers lick their babies to clean them, and adult cats also groom themselves this way. People generally lick things to taste them: you might lick an ice cream cone or a lollipop, or lick salt off your arm after a day at the beach. Colloquially, to <i>lick</i> an opponent is to beat them at a game or fight. In jazz music, a <i>lick</i> is a short burst of music, or a solo.</p></div></div>`;
