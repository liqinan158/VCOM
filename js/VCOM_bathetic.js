var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">bathetic</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Bathetic</i> describes something that's overly sentimental, gushy, and worse yet — insincere. Soap operas are known for their <i>bathetic</i> emotionalism, because the characters cry and wail and scheme over the silliest things.</p><p class="long"><i>Bathetic</i> (the noun is <i>bathos</i>) comes from the Greek word for "depth” but not as in the ocean floor but as in “anticlimax, a descent from the sublime to the ridiculous.” Being bathetic is usually not done on purpose. A bathetic scene in a movie might have a character fall to her knees and scream, “Nooooooo!” because her son left his socks on the floor again. Don't confuse <i>bathetic</i> with <i>pathetic,</i> which means "pitiful."</p></div>`;
