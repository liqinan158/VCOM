Unlike a stretcher, a <i>gurney</i> has wheels so that it doesn't need to be carried.</p><p class="long">When an EMT transports a patient from an ambulance into a hospital emergency room, she uses a gurney. Patients with back injuries often require a gurney so that they can be moved safely, and you might find yourself on a gurney if you need any kind of surgery that calls for general anesthesia. When this word first appeared in the 1920s, it referred to hospital carts used to transport food and laundry.</p></div></div>`;
