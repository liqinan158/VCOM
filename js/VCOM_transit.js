Before we had cell phones, one of the upsides of being in <i>transit</i> was that no one could get in touch with you.</p><p class="long"><i>Transit</i> may be familiar to you from the phrase <i>mass transit</i>. While it sometimes seems like “mass transit” is synonymous with “unreliable, crowded and inefficient,” the phrase just means "public transportation." The first instance of <i>transit</i> being used in this sense was in the 19th century, and people have been complaining ever since. <i>Transit</i> is related to the word <i>transition</i>, which refers to a change from one state or condition to another.</p></div>`;
