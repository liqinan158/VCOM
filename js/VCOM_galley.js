You're not likely to see a <i>galley</i> these days: they were used from ancient to medieval times.</p><p class="long">You may have seen movies portraying old ships with dozens of rowers, lined up on benches. Those ships are galleys. Galleys were used for more than a thousand years, and they played an important role in both war and trade. If someone today says they’ve been in a galley, you can assume they aren’t referring to this kind of ship. They probably mean the galley, or the kitchen area, of a ship or airplane.</p></div>`;
