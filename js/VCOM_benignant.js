var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">benignant</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Someone who's <i>benignant</i> is goodhearted and kind. Your favorite teacher in elementary school was probably the most <i>benignant</i> of them all.</p><p class="long">When you're describing a lovely, warm person you can call her benignant, or even describe someone with a particularly sweet face as looking benignant. Another way to use this adjective is as a less common way to say "benign," or not harmful, especially in a medical sense â€” a benignant tumor, for example, is one that won't hurt you. <i>Benignant</i>, in fact, comes from <i>benign</i>, simply adding the <i>ant</i> on the model of <i>malignant</i>, or "dangerous, infectious, or cancerous."</p></div>`;
