Roll up your pant legs because you'll have to wade through the water at a shallow point.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>ford</i> describes crossing a body of water on foot at a shallow point or driving across it in a vehicle. The idea is that you’re not using a bridge or a boat to cross the water. <i>Ford</i> also has a noun form, meaning a shallow point in a river or stream. So if you ever have to ford a river, make sure you cross at the ford — the shallow point — or you could get very wet.</p></div></div>`;
