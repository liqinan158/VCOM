It has been suggested that <i>recant</i> was first used when someone reversed a charm, curse, or some other type of magical spell that would have been chanted or sung.  Regardless of whether this is true or not, we suggest that you refrain from singing when you need to recant â€” unless you've been casting nasty spells on people.</p></div></div>`;
