When your friend knows every single place and time that his favorite band has played any given song, he has <i>extensive</i> knowledge of that band.</p><p class="long">Use the adjective <i>extensive</i> for something that goes on and on and on.  It works for anything that covers a lot of territory either in physical space, as in "the gardens at the palace are <i>extensive</i>," or conceptually, as in "her knowledge of the mortgage-backed securities market is <i>extensive</i>."  If you are a farmer, you would also use <i>extensive</i> to mean that you are able to work a lot of land without too much effort or manual labor.</p></div></div>`;
