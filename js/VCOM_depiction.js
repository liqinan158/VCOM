If a portrait really looks like you, it's a good depiction â€” the painter or photographer has done a great job. Another way to give a depiction of an experience is to tell or write about it in so much detail that it's like your audience is really there. Actors who portray real people work hard to make their depictions as true as they can.</p></div></div>`;
