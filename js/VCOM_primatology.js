All of these words stem from the Late Latin <i>primas</i>, "of the first rank," and its root, <i>primus</i>, "first." Scientists think of primates as "the first, or highest, order of mammals." You may agree if your interest in primatology has led you to put apes and monkeys at the top of your list of interesting animals.</p></div>`;
