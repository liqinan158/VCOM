This meaning comes from the fact that two-masted warships known as <i>brigs</i> were historically used as floating prisons.</p><p class="long">The word <i>brig</i> is a shortened form of <i>brigantine</i>, "a small, two-masted ship" with large, square sails. These speedy sailing vessels were extremely common until the late 1800s, when steam ships became widely available. These days, most people in the U.S. think of a brig as a military prison, and if a Navy or Coast Guard sailor breaks the law, they'll be "thrown in the brig."</p></div>`;
