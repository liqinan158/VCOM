You could, for example, describe a modern dancer's strange, <i>araneidan</i> movements across the floor.</p><p class="long">When something looks or acts like a spider, it's araneidan. The eight-legged title character in "Charlotte's Web" is araneidan, and the hand movements accompanying the children's song "The Itsy Bitsy Spider" are also araneidan. You can call a spider an <i>araneid</i>, too: both the noun and the verb come from the Latin root <i>aranea</i>, or "spider."</p></div>`;
