At a fancy party, use <i>toothpicks</i> for eating hors d'oeuvres, not for digging food out of your teeth!</p><p class="long">Tooth-picking is, in fact, the original intended use of these handy tools. Experts believe that toothpicks were invented long before modern humans evolvedâ€”there's evidence that Neanderthals used toothpicks. In the 17th century, toothpicks were a luxury (and sometimes made of silver), but by the early 20th century, factories were mass producing wooden toothpicks for everyone to enjoy.</p></div></div>`;
