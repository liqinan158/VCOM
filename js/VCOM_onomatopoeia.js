When a word is formed from the sound that an associated thing makes, call it an example of <i>onomatopoeia</i>.</p><p class="long">In Greek, <i>onomatopoeia</i> (on-uh-mah-tuh-PEE-ah) simply means "word-making," but in English it refers to a very specific process of word-making: an attempt to capture the sound of something. Examples of onomatopoeia in English include <i>burble, buzz, slosh, ratatat,</i> and <i>thud</i>. Words created by onomatopoeia can seem totally natural, but they can be surprisingly different from language to language: in Japanese, dogs say <i>wan wan</i>, but in Greek they say <i>gav gav</i>.</p></div></div>`;
