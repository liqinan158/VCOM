You may go along with your friend's plan to ride an enormous, frightening roller coaster, smiling despite your <i>unvoiced</i> terror.</p><p class="long">This adjective can simply mean "silent," or "not said," like at a disappointing city council meeting where the concerns of a large group of citizens remain unvoiced. It can also mean that something is implied and understood, despite never being spoken aloud. Though a reporter's questions sound respectful, her unvoiced criticism might offend the politician she's interviewing. In speech, <i>unvoiced</i> means "with no vocal cord vibration."</p></div></div>`;
