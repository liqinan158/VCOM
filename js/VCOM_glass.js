While <i>glass</i> can be strong and sturdy, it's also brittle and can be broken easily by an errant baseball.</p><p class="long">Glass has all kinds of practical uses, from car windshields to greenhouse windows to jam jars to drinking glasses.

The Old English source of <i>glass</i> is <i>glæs</i>, ultimately from a Proto-Indo-European root that means "to shine."</p></div>`;
