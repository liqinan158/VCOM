You're a <i>hypocrite</i> if you criticize other people for wearing fur, but pull out your big mink jacket as soon as it gets cold.</p><p class="long">The word <i>hypocrite</i> is rooted in the Greek word <i>hypokrites</i>, which means “stage actor, pretender, dissembler.” So think of a <i>hypocrite</i> as a person who pretends to be a certain way, but really acts and believes the total opposite. Hypocrites usually talk a big talk but fail to follow their own rules — like an outspoken vegetarian who secretly eats bacon.</p></div></div>`;
