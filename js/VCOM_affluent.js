Use <i>affluent</i> to describe wealthy people or areas.</p><p class="long">In Middle English, <i>affluent</i> meant "abundant, flowing," from Old French, from Latin <i>affluÄ“ns</i>, from <i>affluere</i> "to abound in," from the prefix <i>ad-</i> "to, at" plus <i>fluere</i> "to flow." The meaning of "abundant, flowing" is still seen in phrases such as "<i>affluent</i> prose." But mostly, when you use the word <i>affluent</i>, the thing understood to be flowing is cash.</p></div></div>`;
