You might <i>bumble</i> your way through your first dance performance, tripping over your own two feet.</p><p class="long">When you bumble, you walk unsteadily or speak with a stutter. You can also bumble something, or completely mess it up. An inexperienced teacher might bumble her attempts at managing a huge class of middle school students, and you might worry that you'll bumble your first interview as a radio reporter. <i>Bumble</i> was first used in the 1500's, and it's probably an imitative word, or one that sounds like what it means.</p></div>`;
