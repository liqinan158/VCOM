Get help immediately if you see someone <i>convulse</i>. This medical condition can be brought on by something simple (like a rise in body temperature) or something more complicated, such as epilepsy.</p><p class="long">In addition to being a symptom of a medical condition, to <i>convulse</i> is often applied to people shaking with laughter. So if you go to a club and see a hilarious comedian, you may convulse with laughter so hard that you might cry, or not be able to catch your breath, and your sides hurt.</p></div>`;
