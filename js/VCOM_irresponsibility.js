Forgetting to pick your little brother up after school would be evidence of your <i>irresponsibility</i> as a babysitter.</p><p class="long">Letting your house plants die, forgetting to walk your dog, or leaving water boiling on the stove all afternoon are all examples of irresponsibility. People who act in an irresponsible way have this trait. Both <i>irresponsibility</i> and <i>irresponsible</i> have the "not" prefix <i>ir-</i>, and <i>responsible</i>, originally a French word that first meant "legally accountable for one's actions," and later "trustworthy."</p></div></div>`;
