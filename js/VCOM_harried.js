A <i>harried</i> parent might be exhausted but still have to make 3 dozen cupcakes for school and help with a science project.</p><p class="long"><i>Harried</i> comes from the verb <i>harry</i>, which itself is from the Middle English word <i>herigan</i>, meaning to pillage, plunder, or make war. Today, <i>harried</i> doesn't imply an act of war, but rather someone who is frazzled or a situation that might cause that feeling. If the project you're working on has been harried from start to finish, you'll be lucky to keep your sanity.</p></div>`;
