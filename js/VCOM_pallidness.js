In fact the Latin root, <i>pallere</i>, means "be pale." You can use this word or its more common synonym, <i>pallor</i>, when you're describing someone who's so pale that they seem to be unwell or in shock: "His pallidness was soon explained when he described the ghost he'd just seen."</p></div>`;
