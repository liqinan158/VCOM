When <i>liable</i> means "likely," it's with "to": "If you build your house on that cliff, it's <i>liable</i> to fall into the river," or "That part of town is <i>liable</i> to mudslides." Don't confuse <i>liable</i> with <i>libel</i>, which is a legal term for slander, or saying something false and damaging about someone.</p></div></div>`;
