The children's author Dr. Seuss wrote in <i>verse</i>, and the regular rhymes of "The Cat in the Hat" helped generations of children learn to read.</p><p class="long">In music, a <i>verse</i> is a section of a song that's often followed by a chorus. Many people can sing the chorus to "Take Me Out to the Ball Game," but few realize there are also verses, including one that starts, "Katie Casey was baseball mad." <i>Verse</i> comes from the Latin word <i>versus</i>, which means a line of writing and is based on the Proto-Indo-European root <i>wer</i>, meaning to turn or bend.</p></div>`;
