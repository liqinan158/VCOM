You're likely to hear <i>tangled</i> used most often when referring to hair. If it's <i>tangled,</i> you can't brush or comb through it.</p><p class="long">Other than discussing hair, <i>tangled</i> can be used to refer to anything that's jumbled up and confused. Like that tangled pile of wires behind your television and computer that you keep tripping over. <i>Tangled</i> can also mean something highly complicated or intricate, like the relationships between ex-wives, ex-husbands and stepchildren in a family. The word <i>tangled</i> is most famous for being included in a well-known literary quote from Sir Walter Scott's poem, "Marmion" â€” "Oh what a <i>tangled</i> web we weave, when first we practise to deceive."</p></div></div>`;
