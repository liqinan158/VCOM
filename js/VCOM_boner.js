Either way, you probably want to hide your <i>boner</i>.</p><p class="long">This is a very slangy word that is not fit for many situations. No one really wants to hear "I have a boner!" or "I made a boner!" â€” especially because the "erection" meaning has kind of overshadowed the "mistake" meaning. If you mess up, you're better off with a word like <i>goof</i>, <i>flub</i>, <i>blunder</i>, or <i>snafu</i>. Those words are all kind of fun, and they won't get you in any more trouble than you're already in for making a boner.</p></div>`;
