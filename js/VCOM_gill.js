In fish and other aquatic creatures, their <i>gills</i> are equivalent to our lungs.</p><p class="long">Fish and some amphibians need to breathe the oxygen in water to live, and they use their gills for this. Gills are the main organs of respiration for animals that live in or under the water. The root of <i>gill</i> is uncertain, but it may be related to the Old Norse <i>gj√∂lnar</i>, "gills," and rooted in the Proto-Indo-European <i>ghel-una</i>, or "jaw."</p></div></div>`;
