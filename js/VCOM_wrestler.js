If you become a <i>wrestler</i>, you'll learn techniques including stances, holds, and take-downs.</p><p class="long">A high school or college wrestler uses very different moves than a professional wrestler does. So-called "collegiate" or "amateur" wrestlers are trained athletes who follow strict protocols and standards for how they can grapple with and pin each other. Many professional wrestlers are also serious athletes, but the wrestling they do is more entertainment than sport, featuring dramatic backstories and dramatically choreographed moves.</p></div></div>`;
