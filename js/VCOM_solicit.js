It is what those people on the street are doing, when they ask, "Do you have a moment to talk about the destruction of the planet?"

It can also have a more sinister cast. "When the teacher left the room, two girls <i>solicited</i> their friends to throw all the textbooks out the windows, injuring members of the cheer squad below — where they were <i>soliciting</i> signatures for a petition banning smoking in the football locker rooms."</p></div></div>`;
