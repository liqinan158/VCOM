If you and your best friend's families happen to go on vacation to the same place at the same time, that’s a <i>fortuitous</i> coincidence!</p><p class="long">Something fortuitous is random like an accident, but there’s no downside. A rock falling on your head is an accident, dollar bills falling on your head is fortuitous. The meaning of <i>fortuitous</i> is changing from "happening by chance" to "lucky chance" because people get it mixed up with <i>fortunate</i>.  But watch out: If you say <i>fortuitous</i> to mean just plain lucky without the element of chance –– that's a usage error.</p></div></div>`;
