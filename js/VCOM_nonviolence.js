Two of the most famous proponents of <i>nonviolence</i> were Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.</p><p class="long"><i>Nonviolence</i> is a principle, a personal value system, or a way of life. People who practice nonviolence live their lives harming as few other people (or animals, often) as possible. Many political protesters use nonviolence as a tactic during demonstrations, such as sit-ins, die-ins, and other forms of civil disobedience. Once Gandhi used the word <i>nonviolence</i> in this way in 1920, the word became associated with social and political activism.</p></div></div>`;
