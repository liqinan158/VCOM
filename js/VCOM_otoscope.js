This instrument has a magnifying lens and a small light that allows your doctor to see parts of your ear canal that would otherwise be hidden. Occasionally, this tool is also called an <i>auriscope</i>. <i>Otoscope</i> has Greek roots, <i>oto</i> from <i>ous</i>, "ear," and <i>scope</i>, from <i>skopein</i>, "to look at."</p></div>`;
