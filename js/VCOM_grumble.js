Some people <i>grumble</i> a hundred times a day, about everything from the weather to the traffic to their bad luck at bowling.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>grumble</i> is a great example of onomatopoeia, a word that sounds just like what it means. When you say "grumble" out loud, you're practically already grumbling about something. The origin of <i>grumble</i> is the Middle French word <i>grommeler</i>, or "mutter through the teeth." Just think about the things in life that make you want to mutter through your teeth and you'll probably start to grumble.</p></div></div>`;
