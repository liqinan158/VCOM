var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">exult</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Sometimes you might feel so happy about something you could just burst. This is the time to <i>exult</i>, or rejoice, and you might show your great happiness by laughing, dancing, and shouting with pure joy.</p><p class="long">To <i>exult</i> means to express your joy in some visible way. Some people exult in a sedate manner, maybe just enjoying their happiness quietly within themselves. Others are more emotional, perhaps expressing their triumph in a loud or physical manner. When you break the word down into its Latin parts, the <i>ex-</i> means "out," and <i>saltƒÅre</i> means "to leap." So <i>exult</i> means to leap with joy.</p></div>`;
