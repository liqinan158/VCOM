var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">acrobat</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">An <i>acrobat</i> is someone who skillfully performs gymnastic feats or other actions that involve agility and balance, such as a trapeze artist soaring through the air, or a tightrope walker at the circus.</p><p class="long">You may be tempted to conclude that the <i>bat</i> in <i>acrobat</i> is a tribute to the animal that soars through the air when not hanging upside down. The source is not quite that creative. It comes from <i>bainein</i>, which is Greek for "to walk." The <i>acro</i> bit comes from <i>akros</i>, meaning "highest point." So <i>acrobat</i> is a reference to the classic and possibly first trick perfected by these artists, tightrope walking.</p></div></div>`;
