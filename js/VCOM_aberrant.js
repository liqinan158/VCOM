Sitting in a bathtub and singing show tunes all day long might be considered <i>aberrant</i> behavior.</p><p class="long">For conduct that departs from the norm, <i>aberrant</i> is at hand to describe it if you want to set a formal, or even scientific tone to the discussion. You can put the accent on either the first syllable (AB-er-ent) or the second (uh-BER-ent); both pronunciations are acceptable. The Latin root <i>aberrare</i> means "to go astray," from the prefix <i>ab-</i> "off, away" plus <i>errare</i> "to wander."  Other descendants of <i>errare</i> in English, like <i>error</i> and <i>errant</i>, have that double -<i>r</i>- and also refer to something that's either not wanted or not expected.</p></div></div>`;
