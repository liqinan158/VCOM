Used to show emphasis in speech or writing, <i>anaphora</i> is a popular tool for politicians, religious leaders, lyricists, and poets.</p><p class="long">In Martin Luther King, Jr.'s most famous speech, he said "I have a dream" eight different times. He used <i>anaphora</i> as a rhetorical technique, repeating the words to drive home a point. As a literary device, anaphora also gives emphasis and rhythm to lines like these of Charles Dickens: "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times," with the repetition of "it was" eight more times in one sentence. In Greek, <i>anaphora</i> means "a carrying back."</p></div>`;
