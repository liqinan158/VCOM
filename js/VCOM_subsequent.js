If you say, "in 1990 and <i>subsequent</i> years," it includes 1990, whereas "the years <i>subsequent</i> to 1990" do not include it. When you mention a car crash and subsequent traffic jam or a scandal and subsequent investigation, one follows the other in order but a cause and effect relationship is implied too.</p></div></div>`;
