Upscale neighborhoods are full of lovely, high-priced homes, and upscale vacations might involve yachts, exotic beaches, and private planes. <i>Upscale</i> is the opposite of <i>downscale</i>, which you could use to describe a run-down motel or a grubby, cheap diner. Both adjectives first came into use in the mid-1960's.</p></div>`;
