Most <i>eels</i> live in very shallow ocean waters, burrowing into the sand there.</p><p class="long">Eels are a type of fish, and though they are as long and flexible as snakes, they don't have scales, and if you look closely you can see they have a long, low fin. Eels are famous for being slippery, and in fact to be "as slippery as an <i>eel</i>" means to be so sneaky and cunning that you can get away with something illegal or illicit. This figurative meaning dates from the 16th century.</p></div>`;
