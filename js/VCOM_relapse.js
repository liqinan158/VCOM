If your grandmother survived cancer only to have it return two years later, you could say she suffered a <i>relapse</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Relapse</i> implies that someone has recovered from an illness and slid back into a worse state, like when you are getting over a cold but then you suddenly feel bad all over again. Unwanted behavior can also be described this way; if you find yourself biting your nails again, it's a nail-biting relapse. The Latin word <i>relabi</i> is the root of <i>relapse</i>, slip back.</p></div>`;
