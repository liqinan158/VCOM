The <i>scapula</i> connects the collar bone to the upper arm.</p><p class="long">The <i>scapula</i> is the anatomical term for the flat, triangle-shaped bone that makes up a human's shoulder. Other animals have similar bones, often described as <i>scapular</i>. The word <i>scapula</i> means "shoulder" in Late Latin, from the Latin root <i>scapulae</i>, or "shoulder blades." One guess about the word's origin says the original meaning of <i>scapulae</i> was "spades or shovels," based on their similar shapes.</p></div>`;
