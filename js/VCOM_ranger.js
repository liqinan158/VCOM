A park <i>ranger</i> makes sure the rules are followed and provides information to visitors.</p><p class="long">Someone who takes a job as a forest ranger might patrol an area of wooded land, watching for fire danger and enforcing the rules. A ranger's tasks can vary from teaching kids about local plants and animals to fighting fires to arresting people who break laws in a state or national park. The original rangers were British employees of the king or queen who would "range" throughout the woods looking for poachers â€” people who illegally hunted on royal land.</p></div>`;
