Your major in college will probably be zoology, which is a branch of biology focusing on all animals â€” even those that are extinct. A zoologist may end up doing research, or work as a zookeeper in a zoo. <i>Zoologist</i> shares a root with <i>zoology</i>, the Latin <i>zoologia</i>, which combines the Greek words <i>zoion</i>, "animal," and <i>logia</i>, "study."</p></div></div>`;
