The <i>nuts</i> that squirrels typically gather (sometimes storing them temporarily in their cheek pouches) are acorns.</p><p class="long">It might seem strange that a nut is a fruit, since until they've been cracked open, most nuts are as hard and inedible as rocks. Think of the meat of a walnut or almond that hides inside â€” this is the edible seed within the fruit. If someone calls you a <i>nut</i>, or describes you as <i>nuts</i> or <i>nutty</i>, they think you're crazy or wacky, and when you refer to "a tough <i>nut</i> to crack," you're talking about a tricky problem.</p></div>`;
