You might listen to the ceaseless sound of crashing waves at the beach, or you could say that the Internet is a ceaseless source of information.  <i>Ceaseless</i> can also refer to things that only seem like they go on forever; it’s often used in the phrase “seemingly <i>ceaseless</i>.” During a blizzard you might complain about the ceaseless snow, even though the snow will eventually stop.</p></div>`;
