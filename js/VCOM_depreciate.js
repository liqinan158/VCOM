If you bought shares of a company for $10 each a year ago and now theyâ€™re worth $1 each, guess what: they have <i>depreciated</i>.</p><p class="long">One of the most frustrating things about buying a car is the way it loses value. As soon as you drive it off the lot, your new car has already depreciated by several thousand dollars.
