John Keats' famous "Ode on a Grecian Urn" is one well-known ekphrasis, a detailed reflection on a specific work of art. Ekphrasis can also be spoken or take other artistic forms â€” for example, your painting of a sculpture is also an ekphrasis, as is the song you wrote describing Vincent Van Gogh's <i>Starry Night</i>.</p></div></div>`;
