Calling in sick to work every week is another example of absenteeism. Absenteeism can be like a contagious disease — sometimes entire schools have problems with absenteeism. If there’s a good excuse for the absence, like a serious illness, it’s not absenteeism. So don’t forget those doctor’s notes.</p></div></div>`;
