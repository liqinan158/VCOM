For example, after a war, a losing country might make a <i>cession</i> of part of its land to the victor.</p><p class="long">The meaning (and spelling) of the word <i>cession</i>, began with the Latin word meaning "a giving up" and retained that meaning throughout the word's evolution, passing through Old French and Middle English pretty much untouched. We can see its relationship to other words, such as <i>secession</i>, which is the idea of one government breaking away from another, or "giving up" the connection between them, as happened in our own country and led to the Civil War.</p></div></div>`;
