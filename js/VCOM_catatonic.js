Sometimes in the summer it gets so hot that people lose all their energy and get <i>catatonic</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Catatonic</i> can also be used to describe something that is related to psychiatric problems. Catatonic schizophrenia, for example, has symptoms that can include physical immobility, unresponsiveness, or strange movements. The weird thing about the word <i>catatonic</i> is that it can either mean not moving at all or moving in a frenzy â€” or it can mean having totally rigid muscles or having totally relaxed muscles.</p></div></div>`;
