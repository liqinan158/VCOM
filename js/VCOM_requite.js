However, saying that you want to requite a gift means that you want to give something in return for it — not that you want to return the gift to the store for some quick cash. <i>Requite</i> is often used in the context of love; if you requite someone’s love, you love that person back. <i>Requite</i> can also be used in a negative sense. Someone who wants to requite an injury wants payback for it.</p></div>`;
