var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">snarl</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>snarl</i> or make a <i>snarl</i> is to growl like an angry dog or speak abruptly and aggressively. A <i>snarl</i> can also be something tangled or confused.</p><p class="long">If you've ever heard a dog growl, then you know what a snarl is: a dog's snarl says, "Back off!" When people snarl, they speak in an angry way that isn't shouting but sounds mean. A human snarl is abrupt, sharp, and unfriendly. Another sense of the word is when something gets mixed up, like if wires get tangled together: that tangle is called a snarl. This meaning comes from the earliest use of <i>snarl</i>, "a snare or a noose."</p></div>`;
