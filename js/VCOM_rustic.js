This word can be given a positive or a negative spin depending on how you use it; a rustic inn, for example, might be quaint or it might be virtually uninhabitable.</p><p class="long">The words <i>rustic</i> and "rural" spring from the same ancient root: <i>*rur-</i>, which means "open space" in the hypothetical ancestor language Proto-Indo-European. In early usage, these two words were used interchangeably, but now, <i>rural</i> is used to describe locations –- "rural community," "rural location" — while <i>rustic</i> refers to the unrefined qualities associated with country life. The best antonym is <i>cosmopolitan</i>, which implies the sophistication and worldliness of city life.</p></div></div>`;
