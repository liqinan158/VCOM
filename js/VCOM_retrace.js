You could visit the town your ancestors came from and attempt to <i>retrace</i> their steps there.</p><p class="long">When you lose your glasses, some helpful person may ask you, "Did you <i>retrace</i> your steps?" What they're suggesting is that you walk everywhere you went earlier, checking as you go to see if you left them on a table or desk nearby. A detective will also retrace someone's steps to solve a crime, looking for clues while walking where the suspect walked. <i>Trace</i> means "outline," but also "follow a line or a path."</p></div>`;
