If there's "mystery meat" on the menu at school, you'll probably be glad you packed a <i>bologna</i> sandwich.</p><p class="long">Bologna evolved from mortadella, a pork sausage invented in Bologna, Italy. While bologna is pork-based, it can contain beef, chicken, turkey, or even soy protein. This pale, salty lunch meat is mild in flavor and a favorite with kids who find salami a bit too spicy. The correct pronunciation is "bo-LO-nya," but it's common to say "ba-LO-nee" instead. Experts attribute this to Anglicization, which often leaves Italian words with <i>Y</i> endings â€” like <i>Italia</i> becoming <i>Italy</i>.</p></div>`;
