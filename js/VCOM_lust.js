It also can mean a hunger for anything, like <i>lust</i> for power.</p><p class="long">While <i>lust</i> isn't a dirty word, it is a strong word. You don't have <i>lust</i> for something you don't really care about. Lust is a strong, powerful desire, whether it's a noun or verb: you lust for things you deeply crave. Someone greedy lusts for money. Someone gluttonous lusts for food. The most basic meaning of <i>lust</i> is an unquenchable desire for sex, but people lust for all sorts of things.</p></div>`;
