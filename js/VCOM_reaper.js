If your part-time job involves harvesting corn by hand, then you're a <i>reaper</i>. <i>Reaper</i> can also refer to a piece of farm equipment used to harvest crops, especially grains.</p><p class="long">It's not a coincidence that <i>reap</i> looks a lot like the word <i>ripe</i>. When the crops are ripe — in Old English, "ready for reaping, fit for eating" — a reaper, either human or mechanical, can harvest them. <i>Reap</i> means "to cut grain with a hook or sickle." This might remind you of the Grim Reaper, the personification of death in art, movies, and stories, who is shown carrying a sickle and is said to be the harvester of souls.</p></div></div>`;
