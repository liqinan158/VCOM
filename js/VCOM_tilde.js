The Spanish alphabet has 27 letters instead of the English 26, because it includes both n and Ã±, each of which is pronounced differently.</p><p class="long">The tilde has other uses as well. It is a diacritical mark in other languages, such as Portuguese, but it is also used in logic and math. When you put a tilde before a number, for example, you're saying that the number is approximate. If you wanted to say that your club had about $1,500 in the bank, you could use a tilde to write that the club had ~$1,500.</p></div>`;
