When your sister <i>categorically</i> warns you against snooping in her diary, there's no mistaking what she means.</p><p class="long">If you categorically deny knowing anything about who ate the last chocolate chip cookie, you state clearly and directly: "I did not eat that cookie, and I have no idea who did." In fact, anything you do or say categorically is done or said unambiguously and unconditionally. This adverb comes from <i>categorical</i>, "asserting absolutely," and its Greek source <i>kategorikos</i>, "accusatory or affirmative."</p></div>`;
