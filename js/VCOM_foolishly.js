You'll smack your forehead in frustration watching your friend <i>foolishly</i> wash your car without rolling the windows up first.</p><p class="long">When you act foolishly, you don't use your common sense. From foolishly riding your new skateboard down a flight of stairs to foolishly copying your friend's answers on the math test, these actions are the kind you usually wish you could take back. <i>Foolishly</i> is rooted in the Latin <i>follis</i>, "leather bag or bellows." The "silliness" meaning comes from a figurative "windbag," or ridiculous, insensible person.</p></div>`;
