Teachers <i>educate</i> students.</p><p class="long">If the word <i>educate</i> makes you think of children, you're not far off. It comes from the Latin word <i>educare</i> meaning to "bring up, rear.‚Äù In the 1500s, Shakespeare borrowed it to mean "schooling." These days, any time you're in a classroom listening to a lecture, reading a book, or speaking with a teacher, you're being educated. Teachers educate students all the way from preschool to graduate school. Almost any experience can educate if you learn from it.</p></div>`;
