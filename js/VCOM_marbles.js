A World <i>Marbles</i> Championship has been held each year in Britain since 1932. Don't miss it this year.</p><p class="long">Marbles is a game that involves rolling marbles on a sidewalk, inside a marked circle. Players shoot or flick their marbles with their thumbs, aiming "shooters," larger marbles, at the smaller ones, and trying to keep their own marbles inside the circle while hitting other players' marbles out of it. Doing this gives the player a point, and they also get to keep the marble. To "lose your <i>marbles</i>" comes from American slang and means "go crazy."</p></div></div>`;
