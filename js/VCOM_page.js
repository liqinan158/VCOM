There are other <i>pages</i> too, including a medieval knight's assistant and an errand-runner in a legislative office. You can also <i>page</i> someone, or call for them over a speaker in a public place â€” this meaning comes from the idea of "sending a <i>page</i> to fetch someone."</p></div></div>`;
