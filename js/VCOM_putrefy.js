Add ketchup, and the cocktail becomes putrid. But technically, <i>putrid</i>, like <i>putrefy</i>, refers to the smell of something organic that has begun to decompose. Open the lid of your garbage can and you will smell the putrefying remains of your meals. Both <i>putrid</i> and <i>putrefy</i> share the Latin root of <i>putr</i> which you can remember by its first two letters — P. U.!</p></div></div>`;
