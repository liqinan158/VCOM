Chicken Little thought the sky was falling when an <i>acorn</i> fell on his head. Don't make that same mistake.</p><p class="long">Acorns are a distinctive nut that's often found on forest floors where oak trees grow. They are smooth and greenish, set in a rough brown base that's shaped like a little cup. The acorn is a seed, able to sprout roots if it falls in the right place, eventually growing into a new oak tree. Many animals eat acorns, some stockpiling the nuts for weeks. In Old English, <i>Ã¦cern</i> means "nut," from a Germanic origin.</p></div></div>`;
