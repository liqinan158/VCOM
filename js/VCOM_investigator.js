Not all <i>investigators</i> solve crimes, but to be an <i>investigator</i> you need to work hard to figure things out.</p><p class="long">A private investigator knocks at your door. Do you let him in? He probably only wants to ask questions, because that’s what investigators do: they research. Scientists are investigators, so are police officers, and even your friend who reads lots of books about butterflies can be considered an investigator. Rooted in the Latin word <i>vestigare</i>, meaning “trace out,” investigators gather facts in order to trace out the whole picture.</p></div></div>`;
