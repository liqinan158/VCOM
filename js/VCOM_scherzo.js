A <i>scherzo</i> is usually upbeat and sometimes even humorous.</p><p class="long">The plural form of <i>scherzo</i> is <i>scherzi</i>. Many symphonies and sonatas include scherzi, often in their second or third movements. The scherzo developed from the <i>minuet</i>, another lively musical form which itself came from a French dance. In Italian, <i>scherzo</i> means "joke" or "sport," from the root word <i>scherzare</i>, "to jest or joke," and this describes the lighthearted mood of many scherzi.</p></div></div>`;
