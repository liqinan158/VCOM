Originally it was attached to wheels and pulled by men.</p><p class="long">More recently, <i>cannon</i> refers to the largest gun on a tank or the automatic guns on a plane. All cannons, however old they are, have basically the same shape â€” a long, thick tube. Not surprising, then, that the term comes from the Latin word <i>canna</i>, meaning "tube" or "reed." Do not confuse with the word <i>canon</i>, with one <i>n</i>, which is a term of classification, as in its most common usage, "the literary canon."</p></div></div>`;
