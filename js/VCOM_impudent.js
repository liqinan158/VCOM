If your teacher asks the class to open their textbooks, and you snap back, "Let's not and say we did," you're being <i>impudent</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Impudent</i> comes from the Latin combination of <i>im</i>, meaning without, and <i>pudens</i>, meaning shame. We often call someone impudent if they’re disrespectful, snotty, or inappropriate in a way that makes someone feel bad.
