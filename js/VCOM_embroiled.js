You might be <i>embroiled</i> in an argument between two friends, unable to step back and be neutral.</p><p class="long">Two warring countries might be embroiled in peace talks, or two characters on your favorite TV show could be embroiled in a scandal. In either case, people are tangled in a complicated situation or a serious conflict. The earliest meaning of <i>embroil</i> was "throw into disorder," from the French root <i>embrouillier</i>, "entangle or confuse."</p></div>`;
