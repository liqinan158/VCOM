It looks a lot like <i>through</i> but remember <i>thorough</i> is an adjective, so you might use it to describe a thorough investigation or a thorough review. In contrast <i>through</i> is used most often as a preposition — you might look through every drawer, for example, in a search — or as an adverb — you might see a hole in your pocket where coins fall through.</p></div></div>`;
