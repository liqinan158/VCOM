Later the wordâ€™s meaning broadened to refer to a traveling show that offers similar activities, like a winter carnival or a fair. Nowadays the word <i>carnival</i> is also used figuratively to refer to something characterized by raucous disorder. If, for example, your coworkers ended up heckling your CEO at a company meeting, you could describe the scene as a <i>carnival</i> (although you would most likely NOT see any cotton candy in the board room).</p></div></div>`;
