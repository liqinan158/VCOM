Daytime soap operas would be lost without a good <i>coma</i> every few weeks.</p><p class="long"><i>Coma</i> comes from the Greek <i>koma</i> meaning "deep sleep." As with so many words with medical or scientific origins, <i>coma</i> has been appropriated for a far wider range of uses. The zombie-like trance you fall into at family get-togethers like Thanksgiving? That too is a coma, though your chances of recovery are far better than from a real coma. Unless you happen to sit next to Aunt Sadie.</p></div></div>`;
