The term is often used in real estate to refer to a lot line. Wouldn’t it be nice to have your back yard <i>abut</i> a forest preserve or park?</p><p class="long">The Old French word <i>but</i> meant "end" — think of "butt" for a crude way to remember that! — and it was joined to <i>a-</i>, from the Latin <i>ad-</i> "near to." The result was <i>abuter</i>, which meant "to touch at an end." The word eventually became <i>abouter</i>, meaning "to join at the ends, or border on." The idea of <i>abut</i> suggesting a common boundary comes from the late Middle English, and today we use the word when anything touches something else.</p></div></div>`;
