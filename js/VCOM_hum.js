var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">hum</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>hum</i> is to make a low, steady, singing sound with your mouth closed. If you don't know the words to a song on the radio, you can just <i>hum</i> along.</p><p class="long">Other hums are based on the musical hum, making a similar low, constant sound. Bees hum, an electric fan hums, and your car idling quietly also hums. A figurative way to hum is to be busy and loud: "The cafe always seemed to <i>hum</i> with activity." The word <i>hum</i> is imitative (it sounds like the noise it describes), but its earliest form was <i>hommen</i>, in the 1500s, meaning "make a murmuring sound to cover embarrassment."</p></div>`;
