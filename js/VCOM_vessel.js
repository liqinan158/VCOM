This relationship in meaning has existed in language for a long time; the word <i>vessel</i> comes from the Latin word, <i>vascellum</i>, which also means both “vase” and “ship.” The use of the word <i>vessel</i> in reference to “blood vessels” came about in English during the 14th century.</p></div>`;
