If you have ever eaten corn on the cob, you ate the kernels. Popcorn is made by heating corn kernels until they explode, or "pop." Like these examples, sometimes <i>kernel</i> means "a small bit" or "single piece," as in a story someone tells you that couldn't possibly have happened as described, but still has a kernel of truth about human nature.</p></div>`;
