What you seek is a secluded area where you can be alone. A secluded spot conjures the image of someplace removed from the intrusions of life. A writer might want to be secluded so she can get work done, and a couple might want to be secluded so they can spend time together. When you're secluded, there aren't many other people or distractions.</p></div></div>`;
