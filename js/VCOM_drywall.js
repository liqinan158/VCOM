Builders use a lot of <i>drywall</i> when they're constructing a new house.</p><p class="long">There are several ways to make a flat, solid wall over exposed joists and studs. Older houses often have walls made from plaster, while newer homes are much more likely to have drywall, which is easier and faster to install. Drywall is attached in panels to wooden studs with special screws. The trickiest part of installing drywall is taping the panels where they meet, and "mudding" them, or smoothing joint compound over the seams.</p></div></div>`;
