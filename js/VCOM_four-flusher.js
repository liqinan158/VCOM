var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">four-flusher</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Anyone who plays poker knows five cards in a single suit is called a flush. What happens if you have only four of that suit? A whole lot of nothing, which gives us the word <i>four-flusher</i>, a person bluffing at cards, or someone who seems promising, but isn't.</p><p class="long">Use <i>four-flusher</i> as a synonym for conman, trickster, or fake. You won't hear it used very often these days, but hop in a time machine (a <i>four-flusher</i> will sell you a ticket), travel back to the Old West, kick open the bat-wing doors of the local saloon, and you might hear <i>four-flusher</i> slung across a card table as a brawl gets underway. You might even hear it used as a verb, as in, "You better stop four-flushing, or I'll run you out of this town on a pole."</p></div></div>`;
