If the spelling of playwright looks odd, that's because <i>wright</i> is a word for a craftsperson or someone who builds things (like a ship<i>wright</i> builds ships). Given the juggling of characters, scenes, and plots in a play, you can see how writing a play is like building something. The most famous playwright ever in English is William Shakespeare.</p></div></div>`;
