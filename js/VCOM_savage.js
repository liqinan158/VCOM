A place can also be described as <i>savage</i> if it's untamed, uninhabitable, and unwelcoming. When <i>savage</i> takes the form of a noun, it means "a brutal person," and when it's a verb it means "to attack ferociously." Any way you use it, <i>savage</i> is uncivilized and violent.</p></div></div>`;
