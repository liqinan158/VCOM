Often, as in "storage <i>facility</i>," it's a place designed for a specific use, but it can also mean an effortlessness or ease with something.</p><p class="long">The new stadium is a great facility for showing off Olympic winter sports. At this level, all of the ice skaters show a facility that borders on magical. Likewise, the prison is a great facility for storing prisoners. Those prisoners showed a real facility for crime. Related to the French <i>facile</i>, which means "easy," a person who shows a facility for something makes it seem easy. This is cool, especially if that thing is difficult â€” or, as the French might say, <i>difficile</i>.</p></div></div>`;
