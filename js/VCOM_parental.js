A <i>parental</i> kindergarten teacher might pat students' heads and call them "sweetheart."</p><p class="long">You can use the adjective <i>parental</i> to describe a motherly or fatherly person, like your parental uncle who attends all your school plays. It also describes something generally related to parents â€” like parental leave, a work benefit that allows new parents to take some time off to care for their baby; or a parental advisory, which warns parents about the content of an audio recording. The Latin root of <i>parental</i> is <i>parens</i>, "father or mother."</p></div>`;
