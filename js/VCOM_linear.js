The adjective usually refers to something that follows an expected order or sequence — like railroad tracks or even the progression of a disease.</p><p class="long">Drawn from the word <i>line</i>, something linear follows that concept, coming from the Latin <i>līneāris</i>, "belonging to a line."  You might come across the word in mathematics, as in a "linear equation," or in electronics, with a "linear circuit." It also can be used to refer to a written work that follows a "linear narrative."  If a movie has lots of flashbacks and happens out of order, it does not have a linear narrative.  You might find such a movie puzzling but enjoyable, or you might prefer something more chronological and linear.</p></div></div>`;
