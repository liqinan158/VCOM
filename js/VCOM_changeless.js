Larger concepts are often described as changeless: your best friend might believe that morality is changeless, while you think that notions of right and wrong evolve over time. The adjective <i>changeless</i> is formed by adding the suffix <i>-less</i>, "lacking," to <i>change</i>, which comes from a Latin root meaning "to exchange."</p></div></div>`;
