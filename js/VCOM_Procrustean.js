Tyrannical governments can be <i>Procrustean</i>, as can certain clubs and organizations.</p><p class="long">This marvelous adjective characterizing pointless or ruthless demand for conformity owes its meaning to a son of the Greek god Poseidon: Procrustes, who stretched his guests or cut off their legs in order to make them fit his bed. A frustrated — and well-spoken — high school student might accuse his school of using Procrustean means to force all students to fit one particular educational mold.</p></div></div>`;
