Sometimes they have fake skin that looks so real you can’t tell the difference.  For all you know, the person sitting next to you is an <i>android</i>.</p><p class="long">Life’s biggest question: What’s the difference between cyborgs and androids? Cyborgs are humans with robot parts added to them, and androids start as robots and then get designed to look like humans. The Latin root <i>androides</i> literally means “resembling a man,” and androids really know how to blend in.  Androids mostly appear in science fiction novels and films, but who knows, maybe you’re friends with an android and you don’t even know it.  Yet.</p></div></div>`;
