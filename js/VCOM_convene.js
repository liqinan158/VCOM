We use it in place of the words "call a meeting" for such situations as government assemblages, court hearings, and conferences. Its meaning can be easily seen in its history — it comes from the Latin <i>con-</i>, which means "together," and the verb <i>venīre</i>, "to come." Imagine, if the syllables had just fit the music, the Beatles song "Come Together," might have been called "Convene."</p></div>`;
