When the spermatozoon fertilizes the ovum, the resulting cell has the full complement of genes, so it's a diploid cell. The diploid cell then divides rapidly, becoming first an embryo, then a fetus. The word <i>zygote</i> comes from the Greek word for <i>yoke</i> — joining two things together, like hitching two oxen together to pull a plow.</p></div></div>`;
