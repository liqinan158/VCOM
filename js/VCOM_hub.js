That makes sense when you consider that a hub, in a wheel or otherwise, is the center of whatever's going on. Southern California has long been a hub of the computer industry, and Detroit used to be the hub of the auto industry. Busy airports like the ones in Chicago and Atlanta are called <i>hubs</i>. Any hub is important, because it's right in the middle of all the action.</p></div></div>`;
