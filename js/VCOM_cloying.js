It’s how folks who love espresso feel about Frappuccino. <i>Cloying</i> comes in handy to describe things that are too sweet both literally. "Don’t worry about him trying to kiss you; your <i>cloying</i> perfume is sure to keep him at arm’s length." Or figuratively. "Your incessant flattery and <i>cloying</i> way of hanging on my every word was charming at first, but now I wish you’d go away."</p></div></div>`;
