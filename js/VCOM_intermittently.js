If you studied <i>intermittently</i> last night, that means sometimes you studied but sometimes you took breaks to do other things.</p><p class="long">If something happens intermittently, it doesn’t happen all the time or in a steady flow, but goes in fits and starts. It might rain intermittently on Monday or your car might intermittently refuse to start. Make sure you spell <i>intermittently</i> with two “t”s. You can blame the Latin for that: <i>intermittently</i> evolved from the Latin root <i>intermittĕre</i>, which means “to cease.”</p></div></div>`;
