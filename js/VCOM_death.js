Whether it’s only an instant or it takes years, <i>death</i> is always permanent, no matter what vampire movies try to tell you.</p><p class="long"><i>Death</i> has many meanings and uses, but it always means the end of something.  It can be a single moment like the death of a fish eaten by an alligator, a slow process like the death of cassette tapes as compact discs became popular, or an ongoing state like the death of an ancient language. Death isn’t always bad: the death of a human is depressing, but the death of a vegetable is dinner.</p></div>`;
