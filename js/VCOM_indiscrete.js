It’s a rare word that’s often confused with "indiscreet," but <i>indiscrete</i> (<i>-ete</i>) has nothing to do with telling secrets.</p><p class="long"><i>Indiscrete</i> comes from the Latin <i>indiscretus,</i> meaning "not separate," and has evolved to describe a thing that's not dividable. An orange can be separated into slices (parts), but this isn't the case with a rock, which is indiscrete. The layers on a delicious croissant are flakey and separate, but a hamburger bun is usually just an indiscrete hunk of bread. <i>Indiscrete</i> is often used in math to describe anything that can’t be divided.</p></div></div>`;
