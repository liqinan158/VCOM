You can recognize <i>cormorants</i> by their long necks and dark color.</p><p class="long">Cormorants live in coastal areas and use their sharp bills to catch fish. They look similar to ducks or seagulls when they float on the water, but when they hunt for fish, cormorants dive completely under water and disappear from the surface for several seconds. In Old French, the word for this bird was <i>cormarenc</i>, from the Late Latin <i>corvus marinus</i>, or "sea raven."</p></div>`;
