If you're <i>antipathetic</i> to a particular basketball team, you'll root enthusiastically for whatever team they're playing against.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>antipathetic</i> and noun <i>antipathy</i> come from the Greek <i>antipathes</i>, "an opposition of feeling," and its roots <i>anti</i>, "opposite," and <i>pathein</i>, "to suffer or feel." It's not quite full-on hatred, but an antipathetic feeling is a strong aversion or distaste. If your cousins are antipathetic to furry animals, you might want to reconsider inviting them to stay for two weeks â€” they won't enjoy hanging out with your four cats, three dogs, and affectionate chinchilla.</p></div></div>`;
