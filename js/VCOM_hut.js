What all huts have in common is a simple design and the intention that it provide a short-term shelter from the weather. Campers, hikers, and skiers often rest or sleep in huts. The word comes from the French <i>hutte</i>, "cottage," which has its root in the Old English word for "to hide," <i>hydan</i>. <i>Hut</i> was originally used in English to describe military dwellings.</p></div>`;
