You might be familiar with lullabies like "Hush, Little Baby," "Rockabye Baby," and "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star," all of which have been sung for generations to sleepy children by their parents, grandparents, and babysitters. The word <i>lullaby</i> comes from the Middle English <i>lullen</i>, "to lull or soothe," and <i>bye</i>, as in "bye bye."</p></div></div>`;
