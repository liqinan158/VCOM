Always being told "Be careful!" by your parents can be wearisome, and typing data into a computer all day is also wearisome. The original, fifteenth century meaning of <i>wearisome</i> was "weary" or "tired," but it quickly came to mean "making one weary," from the Old English root <i>werig</i>, "tired."</p></div>`;
