In other words, it's not a good idea to eat them. You can use the terms <i>mushroom</i> and <i>toadstool</i> interchangeably â€” although most people save <i>toadstool</i> for fairy tales and poisonous fungi; it's not a scientific term. The root is probably just the creative combination of the Middle English <i>tadde</i>, "toad," and <i>stole</i>, "stool."</p></div></div>`;
