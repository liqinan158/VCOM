As a verb, <i>plan</i> means the act of thinking about how to achieve your aims. You might plan to apply to colleges soon. When you plan something, you're laying the seeds for a future result, so it's not surprising that <i>plan</i> comes from the early English word <i>plante</i>, meaning "seedling."</p></div>`;
