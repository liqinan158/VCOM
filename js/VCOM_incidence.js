You’ll hear of “<i>incidences</i> of cancer” or “<i>incidences</i> of war." You hope the <i>incidence</i> is decreasing, not increasing.</p><p class="long">You might confuse <i>incidence</i> and <i>incident</i>. They sound similar, but <i>incident</i> refers only to something that happened, not to the frequency with which it happens. After a car accident, the police file an incident report, which is a fancy way of saying they write down what happened. Looking at these reports grouped together can show you if the incidence of accidents at specific intersections in town is on the rise.</p></div></div>`;
