If you <i>reverse</i> your position, you suddenly take the opposite side of the argument. If you <i>reverse</i> your fortunes, your bad luck turns good, or your good luck turns bad. Oops.</p><p class="long">The Latin word <i>revertere</i> means “turn back.” To <i>reverse</i> means to turn back, take the opposite direction, go the other way. Many things can be reversed: you can reverse a decision, you can reverse a car — by putting it in the gear called "reverse." You can reverse a political argument, a promotion, even some surgical procedures, but you can never reverse the steady progress of time, no matter how many Botox injections you get.</p></div></div>`;
