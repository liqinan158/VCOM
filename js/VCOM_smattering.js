It's probably less than a bunch, but it's not much more than a whit or a jot. If you said "There's a smattering of squirrels in the park," then there are only a few squirrels. This word also implies that you don't understand a subject very well â€” a smattering of knowledge is only a tiny bit of knowledge.</p></div>`;
