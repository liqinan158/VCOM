People who are <i>blind</i> can often get around easily with the aid of a cane and sometimes a service dog.</p><p class="long">You might get hit by a baseball and end up blind in one eye, or be temporarily blind after a trip to the eye doctor. The word also means "without looking," as in a blind taste test of three different brands of chocolate milk. A figurative way to be blind is to refuse or be unable to see the truth: "He was <i>blind</i> to the reality of the situation." This tendency can be called a person's "<i>blind</i> side."</p></div>`;
