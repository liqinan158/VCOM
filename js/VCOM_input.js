Why they weren't satisfied just to "put in" the data, we may never know. Before that, the noun <i>input</i> was an economic term meaning anything that went into production: the grain was just one input among several required for the production of cereal. But often, these days, <i>input</i> means a contribution of some kind, usually a thought. You'll thank me for my input later.</p></div>`;
