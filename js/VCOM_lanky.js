You wouldn’t use <i>lanky</i> to describe a tall, slender person who moves gracefully. Instead use <i>lanky</i> to describe someone who moves clumsily on his long limbs. You’ve probably seen a lanky basketball player who moves awkwardly but is still able to make the play, or a lanky teenager who seems to be made up entirely of long legs and long arms.</p></div></div>`;
