The art show patrons couldn't help but chuckle at the <i>incongruity</i> of a toilet sitting in the middle of an exhibition of Renaissance paintings.</p><p class="long">An <i>incongruity</i> is very different from everything around it, to the point of being inappropriate to the situation. A cat at a dog's birthday party would be an <i>incongruity</i>, as would a pacifist at a meeting of the War Lovers' Society. <i>Incongruity</i> is the idea that something is <i>incongruous</i>, or inappropriate. A purple towel is an incongruity in an all black-and-white bathroom.</p></div>`;
