The effect is as soft and calming as the word itself. This word is <i>onomatopoeic</i>, meaning it sounds like what it means: a susurration creates a sense of soft sound swirling around your ears pleasantly. This is the opposite of words like racket and cacophony — loud, unpleasant noises. A susurration is so soft you might not even notice it at all.</p></div></div>`;
