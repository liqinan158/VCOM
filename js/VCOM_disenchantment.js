The <i>disenchantment</i> of young voters can have a strong effect on an election's outcome.</p><p class="long">When you confess your disenchantment with school, it means you've been feeling disappointed by your classes lately â€” you may have had high expectations or started out the school year loving every class and admiring your teachers. Losing unrealistic expectations or beliefs results in disenchantment. The noun comes from <i>disenchant</i>, "cause to be disappointed," rooted in <i>dis-</i>, "do the opposite of," and <i>enchant</i>, "charm or cast a spell on."</p></div></div>`;
