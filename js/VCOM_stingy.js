var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">stingy</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If you are looking to describe someone with a Scrooge- or Grinch-like tendency to pinch his pennies, then <i>stingy</i> can be your adjective of choice. Or, if you are looking to describe something you have too little of — like a 43-second coffee break — you can use <i>stingy</i> as well.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>stingy</i> (pronounced with a soft "g") is likely derived from the adjective <i>stingy</i> (pronounced with a hard "g"), which means "biting, sharp, or stinging." Although <i>stingy</i> is usually used to describe an ungenerous or miserly person, <i>stingy</i> can also be used to describe a larger entity: "People were no longer able to buy homes due to the <i>stingy</i> lending policies of the banks."</p></div></div>`;
