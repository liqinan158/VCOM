A smiley face emoji is an <i>ideograph</i> that represents happiness.</p><p class="long">Many street signs are ideographs, meant to convey a specific meaning without using any words. "Pedestrian crossing" might be a graphic representation of people walking, and "No smoking" is usually a picture of a cigarette inside a circle with a line through it. Hieroglyphics and cuneiform are mainly ideographs, and so are mathematical symbols and emoji. <i>Ideograph</i> combines the Latin <i>idea</i> with <i>graph</i>, "instrument for writing."</p></div>`;
