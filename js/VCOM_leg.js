All <i>legs</i>, including those of humans and tables alike, are meant to support.</p><p class="long">Your leg is the appendage that stretches from your hip to your ankle, bending handily at the knee so you can run, walk, jump, sit, and skip. You probably also use the word <i>leg</i> to refer to one side of your pants; a support holding a table up; and one separate section of a long trip: "I'm stopping for coffee on the next <i>leg</i> of my journey." <i>Leg</i> probably comes from a Proto-Indo-European root meaning "to bend."</p></div></div>`;
