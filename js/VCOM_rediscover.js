Making your mom's chocolate chip cookie recipe, for example, might help you rediscover your love of baking after being out of practice for years. <i>Rediscover</i> adds the "again" prefix <i>re-</i> to <i>discover</i>, which comes from the Latin roots <i>dis-</i>, "opposite of," and <i>cooperire</i>, "to cover up."</p></div>`;
