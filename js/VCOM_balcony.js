Your apartment might have a <i>balcony</i> with a view of a city park.</p><p class="long">Most balconies have railings around them to protect people from tumbling off, and many balconies provide an interesting view. You might linger on the balcony of your hotel room in Hawaii, enjoying the warm air and the distant glimpse of the ocean it gives you. <i>Balcony</i> comes from the Italian <i>balcone</i>, which in turn comes from <i>balcone</i>, or "scaffold." The root is most likely Germanic, possibly related to the Old English <i>balca</i>, "beam or ridge."</p></div>`;
