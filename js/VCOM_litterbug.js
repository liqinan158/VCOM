In many cities, you can be fined for being a <i>litterbug</i>.</p><p class="long">The informal <i>litterbug</i> is the perfect scornful name for someone who doesn't care about keeping the city, beach, or school grounds clean. In Britain, a litterbug might find himself referred to instead as a "litter lout." The New York City subway system is often credited with coining the word <i>litterbug</i> in the 1940s, from the model of <i>jitterbug</i>, a dance that was popular in the 1930s.</p></div>`;
