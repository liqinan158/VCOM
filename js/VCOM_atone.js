Religious believers are known to <i>atone</i> for their sins, but even students can <i>atone</i> for a past failure by acing a quiz or two.</p><p class="long">The word <i>atone</i> came to English as a contraction of the words <i>at</i> and <i>one</i>. The verb means to make amends or reparations for an offense or wrong doing. You can remember the meaning by thinking of it as a sort of Zen concept, to be "at one" or in harmony with someone, you have to atone for your mistakes and be forgiven. In a religious sense, it means to repent for sins ("to <i>atone</i> for his sins").</p></div></div>`;
