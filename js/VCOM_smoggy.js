The term was invented in the early 1900s to describe an unfortunate weather phenomenon first noted in London, where "pea soup fog" was a serious problem for much of the 19th and 20th centuries. Today's smoggy cities get their smog from different sourcesâ€”instead of coal fires, for example, smoggy pollution is mainly caused by cars.</p></div>`;
