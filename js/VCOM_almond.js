Almond trees flower in the spring, before the nuts are ready to harvest. While wild almonds are poisonous, the nut of the domesticated, sweet almond is delicious. We know the word <i>almond</i> comes from the Greek <i>amygdalos</i>, or "almond tree," but its origin beyond that is uncertain.</p></div></div>`;
