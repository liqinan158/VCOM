When someone has done some wrong to you, you can seek justice (in the form of payment) by taking them to court. <i>Tortum</i> itself comes from <i>tortus</i> (also Latin) meaning "twisted." So remember if someone does something twisted, like spread terrible lies about you, you could pursue a tort claim.</p></div></div>`;
