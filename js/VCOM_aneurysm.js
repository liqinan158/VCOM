If it bursts, it can be life-threatening.</p><p class="long">While aneurysms can form anywhere, they are most common in the brain and cardiac areas. This is a very serious medical event that can cause injury and even death. Even though aneurysms are potentially deadly, people use the word sometimes in exaggerations. For example, if you see that someone is getting mad, you might say, "Don't have an aneurysm about it!" That just means something like "Take it easy! Don't get so excited."</p></div>`;
