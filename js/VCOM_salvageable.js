You'll be dismayed if you drop your cell phone and the screen cracks, but you'll feel better when you realize it's <i>salvageable</i>.</p><p class="long">To <i>salvage</i> something is to save, preserve, or rescue it, and if you can successfully do this, you can say it's <i>salvageable</i>. A terrible accident might total your car, making it impossible to fix, but after a small fender bender your car will probably be salvageable. If you gossip about your best friend and he hears about it, you'll hope your friendship is salvageable. The root of <i>salvageable</i> is the Old French <i>salver</i>, "to save."</p></div></div>`;
