The study of this phenomenon is called "parapsychology," which includes things like mind reading and reincarnation as well. The term <i>telekinesis</i> was first used in 1890 by Alexander N. Aksakof, a Russian adviser to the Czar, who combined the Greek <i>tele</i>, "at a distance," with <i>kinesis</i>, "movement or motion."</p></div></div>`;
