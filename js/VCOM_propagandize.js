Most governments have been known to <i>propagandize</i> in an attempt to influence the perception (and behavior) of their citizens.</p><p class="long">A government might propagandize at the start of a war to rally support, and political protesters may propagandize to raise awareness of an issue or inspire others to get involved with their cause. Corporations sometimes propagandize to influence buyers and investors. These groups could print posters and flyers or run radio and TV ads spreading their message. The earliest so-called propagandizing was done by eighteenth century Catholic cardinals whose mission was to "propagate the faith."</p></div>`;
