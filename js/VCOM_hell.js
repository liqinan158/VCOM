If you're religious, you might believe in <i>hell</i> as a place where bad people go after they die.</p><p class="long">Even if you don't subscribe to a religion that includes a concept of eternal hell for evil or blasphemous people, you might use the word to describe a terrible place or situation. Someone who's suffered an agonizing ordeal might say, "I've been through <i>hell</i>." The phrase "when <i>hell</i> freezes over" basically means "never," since hell is famous for its reputation as burning with infinite fire.</p></div></div>`;
