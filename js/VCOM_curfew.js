A town may set a <i>curfew</i> for teenagers, for example, although many parents impose a stricter <i>curfew</i> for their own kids.</p><p class="long">Historically, a curfew was signaled by the ringing of a bell meant to alert residents that it was time to put out their hearth fires. The word <i>curfew</i> comes from an Old French word <i>cuevrefeu</i>, "cover fire," <i>cuevre</i> meaning to cover, and <i>feu</i> meaning fire. Over time, <i>curfew</i> has come to refer to getting people off the streets at night and into their homes, often during times of civil unrest.</p></div>`;
