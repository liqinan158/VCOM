If  you travel to Canada, you'll have to decide whether you want to go to the province of Quebec, or Saskatchewan, or one of the other 8 provinces in that enormous country.</p><p class="long">Many countries are divided into provinces. In the U.S. we don't have official provinces; we have states and counties. But we can use <i>province</i> in its other meaning, which is "the sphere of one's activities." If you manage a coffee shop and sit there reading and drinking coffee even when you're not working, then that shop is your province.</p></div></div>`;
