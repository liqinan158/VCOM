If there's something about the future, something beyond human comprehension in there, maybe you're a <i>mystic</i> or someone who believes in supernatural realities.</p><p class="long">One of the most famous mystics in history is Nostradamus, who some people credit with predicting events like the French Revolution and the atom bomb. Whether you believe in mystics or not, the word is not just used to describe people.  When something is mystic, it has to do with religious mysteries and practices or it simply inspires a sense of mystery or wonder, like the Himalaya Mountains, which some people consider a mystic place.</p></div></div>`;
