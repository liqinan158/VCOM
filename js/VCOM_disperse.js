If you turn it over, the marbles will disperse across the floor, moving away from you in all directions. Another word for this is <i>scatter</i>. Don't confuse this word with <i>disburse</i>, which means to distribute money. Remember that false friends disperse when you cease to disburse.</p></div></div>`;
