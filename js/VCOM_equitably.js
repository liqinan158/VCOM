To share a pizza <i>equitably</i>, you need to give each of your friends the same number of slices.</p><p class="long">In an ideal society, people would be equitably paid for the work they do: men and women would make the same wage for doing the same job, for example. Most fair-minded people try to treat everyone equitably, although most of us tend to give special preference to those we love and care about. <i>Equitably</i> comes from the French <i>Ã©quitable</i>, "equitable or fair," ultimately from the Latin <i>aequitatem</i>, "equality, fairness."</p></div>`;
