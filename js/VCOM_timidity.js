If so, you probably feel uneasy in new places and situations. You might fear having to make decisions. But as you get more comfortable, your <i>timidity</i> will go away.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>timidity</i> is related to the Latin word <i>timidus</i>, from <i>timere</i>, meaning “to fear.” In fact, fear is often a cause of timidity — fear of the unknown, fear of not knowing what to do. For example, you might experience timidity in visiting a country for the first time because you aren't sure of the local customs or you don't speak the language well. Because you are afraid of embarrassing yourself, you hold back.</p></div>`;
