If you have a <i>venturesome</i> child, you may worry because she's the one you find on top of the playhouse instead of inside it.</p><p class="long">The root word of <i>venturesome</i> is <i>venture</i>, and <i>venture</i> is short for <i>aventure</i>, which is a form of <i>adventure</i>, which we understand to be an interesting or exciting experience. Some people are more venturesome than others. You may thrive on mountain climbing or going to the top of the Eiffel Tower, or your idea of adventure may be occasionally trying a strawberry jelly with your peanut butter instead of grape.</p></div>`;
