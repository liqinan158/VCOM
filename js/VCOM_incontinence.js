Sometimes that means you can't help but pee your pants. Another, more pleasant type of <i>incontinence</i> has to do with being undisciplined and addicted to life's pleasures.</p><p class="long">You probably don't want anything to do with incontinence. It could mean you're wetting the bed. It could also mean you're pooping your pants. Incontinence is something we expect of babies, but it can also happen to very sick or old people. Another kind of incontinence has to do with not being in control of your life. If you can't stop spending money, drinking, and staying out late, that's a type of incontinence, too.</p></div></div>`;
