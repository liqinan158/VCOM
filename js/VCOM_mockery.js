The act of mockery often involves copying someone's behavior or speech, making it look absurd, like a parody. For example, comedians often get laughs with mockery, by pretending to be famous politicians and exaggerating the way they talk or gesture. The expression "to make a <i>mockery</i> of" means to make something appear foolish or absurd, even if that’s not the intent — like a trial that “makes a <i>mockery</i> of justice.”</p></div></div>`;
