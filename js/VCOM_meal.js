Breakfast is usually the first <i>meal</i> of the day, but if you oversleep your first <i>meal</i> might be lunch instead.</p><p class="long">You can use the word <i>meal</i> to talk about the occasion (like dinner or brunch), or about the food itself. For example, you might say that chili and cornbread is your favorite meal during the colder months, or that a fast food hamburger eaten in the car is a poor excuse for a meal. Yet another meaning of <i>meal</i> is "edible ground grain or beans," like cornmeal or soybean meal.</p></div></div>`;
