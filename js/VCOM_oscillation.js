Rumor has it if you trace the word back far enough, you get to the word for “a little face” of Bacchus, Greek god of wine, people used to hang up in vineyards to swing in the breeze. When there's oscillation, something is going back and forth, like a hanging sculpture going to and fro in the backyard.</p></div></div>`;
