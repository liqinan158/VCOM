If you’re making phony money in the basement, you’ll be in trouble if you get caught using it. <i>Phony</i> has a noun version with a similar meaning. If you say someone or something is a phony, then you’re saying it isn’t what it pretends to be. Someone who’s a phony isn’t sincere, like your classmate who pretended to be your best friend just to try to steal your boyfriend.</p></div></div>`;
