This kind of <i>fix</i> means "fasten," as when you fix your eyes on the clock, or you affix a stamp to a letter. When you're transfixed by something, you’re fastened to it. Scary things can transfix, but so can beauty. When you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower, you're likely to be transfixed by the view of Paris and never want to leave.</p></div></div>`;
