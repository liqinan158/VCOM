It also changes an incoming signal back so it can be read on the computer.</p><p class="long">Although a form of <i>modem</i> was used as early as 1940 to connect teletype machines to telephones, the word appeared with growing use in 1958, taken from its function as a "modulator" and "demodulator" of sound signals, changing them from audio to digital and back again. This is critical in computer use. Since its inception, modem speeds, measured in bits per second, or bps, have increased dramatically, from the early 300 bps to scorching speeds of USB wireless modems.</p></div>`;
