Universally recognized gestures used to <i>beckon</i> include crooking the finger or nodding the head to  invite someone over.</p><p class="long">We get the word <i>beckon</i> from the Old English <i>gebecnian</i>, meaning "to make a mute sign," which comes from <i>bÄ“acen</i>, meaning "a sign or beacon."  (Remember that "beacon" is a noun while  <i>beckon</i> is a verb).  When you beckon to someone, you give them a physical sign to "come here."  Figuratively, an ice cream sundae might beckon you, calling you away from your diet.</p></div>`;
