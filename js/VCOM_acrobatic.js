An <i>acrobatic</i> dance routine might include back flips and handstands.</p><p class="long">If you're acrobatic, you're good at gymnastics or physical circus tricks. A border collie might make a particularly acrobatic Frisbee catch, twisting and spinning in the air, and a little boy could perform acrobatic cartwheels across the living room. The adjective comes from <i>acrobat</i>, which in French — <i>acrobate</i> — means "tightrope walker," from a Greek word, <i>akrobates</i>, "rope dancer," related to <i>akrobatos</i>, "going on tip toe" or "climbing up high."</p></div></div>`;
