Frogs, amazingly, are able to <i>jump</i> up to twenty times the length of their body.</p><p class="long">You can jump over a puddle or over the jump rope your friends are turning. You might jump in surprise or fear, like when a scary noise in the night makes you jump, or startle. You can jump off of something, like a diving board, or figuratively jump into an activity. If a bully <i>jumps</i> you, he attacks you suddenly, and if your brother says, "Go <i>jump</i> in a lake," he means "Go away, you're bothering me."</p></div>`;
