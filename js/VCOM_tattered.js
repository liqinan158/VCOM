You'll understand <i>tattered</i> if your dress has been dragging under your car for the last 100 miles. It will be a <i>tattered</i> mess.</p><p class="long">Tattered often applies to clothes. If you're a nice guy, you might give your coat to the homeless man with the coat that's so tattered it's threadbare and see-through. You can also use <i>tattered</i> figuratively, for something that's in shambles, like the tattered reputation you would have if you embezzled from your grandmother. The word <i>tattered</i> comes from Middle English, from a time when people wore clothing with decorative slashes, and apparently <i>tatter</i> originally meant "a scrap of cloth."</p></div>`;
