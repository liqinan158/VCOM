If there's a fire in a building, everyone will be stampeding <i>frantically</i> to the nearest exit. Just try not to get trampled.</p><p class="long">The word <i>frantically</i> comes from the Middle English <i>frentik</i> meaning "insane, violently mad," which is just what someone behaving frantically acts like. This word can be used to describe any number of actions. Your mother might be frantically pacing the room if you come home well after your curfew, or you might be frantically running to a class if you're late.</p></div>`;
