A furious senator might give her colleagues an earful when they can't reach a compromise, and a frustrated father might give his kids an earful after losing track of them in a busy shopping mall. <i>Earful</i> was first used in the mid-1900's, from the Old English roots <i>eare</i>, or "ear," and the suffix <i>ful</i>, "full or full of."</p></div></div>`;
