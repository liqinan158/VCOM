The <i>resplendence</i> of the sunset over the Pacific Ocean might take your breath away.</p><p class="long">Something that has resplendence is gorgeous in a grand, brilliant way. You could describe a city's resplendence, like your first view of New York all lit up at night from across the Hudson River, or you might comment on your friend's resplendence on his wedding day. The noun <i>resplendence</i> comes from the Latin <i>resplendentem</i>, "brilliant," which is the present participle of <i>resplendere</i>, "to glitter or shine."</p></div></div>`;
