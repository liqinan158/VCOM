That meaning is still common, especially in the field of anatomy, but these days you can use the word in a broader sense to refer to the highest point of anything. Still, it’ll help you remember the meaning of <i>vertex</i> if you visualize the top of someone’s head — the highest point — when you think of this word. If you want to get technical, in the field of mathematics, <i>vertex</i> can refer to the point at which lines meet and form an angle, or to the point on a figure, such as a triangle or cone, that is opposite to its base.</p></div>`;
