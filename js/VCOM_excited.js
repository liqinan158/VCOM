Or a kid on Christmas morning. Or a kid on the last day of school.</p><p class="long">Meaning more than just "wildly happy," <i>excited</i> describes all sorts of excessive emotions (and not always the good ones). If you're excited you might be agitated, nervous, anxious, or worked up about something. Skip a little further out on the <i>excited</i> spectrum and you're verging on a loss of control: You're delirious, frantic, mad, or unrestrained. Less like a kid in a candy store than a kid on his tenth cup of espresso.</p></div></div>`;
