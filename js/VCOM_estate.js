When you own an <i>estate</i>, it usually means you have a whole lot of money to go along with it.</p><p class="long">While an <i>estate</i> refers mostly to land and a house on it, it can also refer to all of a person’s possessions — and this sense of the word is often used after someone has died to refer to everything they are leaving behind. “You are set to inherit half of your grandfather’s <i>estate</i>, which includes his entire collection of stuffed raccoons.” In the past (and sometimes still) <i>estate</i> was also used to refer to someone’s state or condition, as well as his or her social standing.</p></div></div>`;
