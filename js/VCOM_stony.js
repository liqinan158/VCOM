var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">stony</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Someone who's <i>stony</i> shows little emotion or sympathy for other people. As your math teacher hands back last week's geometry quiz, her <i>stony</i> face won't seem like a very good sign.</p><p class="long">A face with a stony expression is so lacking in feeling that it is "like stone." The other way to use the adjective <i>stony</i> is to mean "with lots of stones," like when you talk about a stony blueberry field in Maine or a stony path leading up to a lush garden. <i>Stony</i> comes from the Old English <i>stanig</i>, with its root of <i>stan</i>, "rock or gem."</p></div>`;
