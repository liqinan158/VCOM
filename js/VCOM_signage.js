This usually refers to commercially oriented signs, like the ones on billboards. <i>Signage</i> is a collective noun, so it stands for more than one thing, even though it doesn't end in an "s." Other collective nouns are <i>luggage</i> and <i>tonnage</i>, which refer to more than one bag and ton, respectfully.</p></div>`;
