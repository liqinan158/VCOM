When a restaurant offers you a free dessert as <i>compensation</i> for messing up your dinner order, the hope is that you will leave happy (and refrain from writing a negative review online).</p><p class="long"><i>Compensation</i> can also be money, a payment meant to give someone a fair exchange for their effort and output. In fact, the word comes from the Latin word <i>compensat-</i>, meaning "weighed against." If you receive fair compensation for your work, the money is equal to your time and effort. In other words, the scale is balanced.</p></div></div>`;
