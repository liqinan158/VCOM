As in, "How do I love thee? Let me enumerate the ways." This verb came about in the 1610’s as a variation on the Latin <i>enumerates</i>, which means “to reckon up or count over.” To quote Paul Valery, the French critic, essayist, and poet, “Science is feasible when the variables are few and can be enumerated; when their combinations are distinct and clear."</p></div>`;
