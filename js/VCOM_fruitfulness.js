Your five-year-old cousin's <i>fruitfulness</i> as an artist means that she goes through a box of crayons every single week.</p><p class="long">An apple orchard's fruitfulness literally results in a lot of fruit â€” the more fruitful it is, the more apples it produces. There are other, more figurative types of fruitfulness too. If your aunt and uncle have a huge family, with 12 kids, people might remark on their fruitfulness. And if a poet goes through a period of creating dozens and dozens of poems, that's a kind of creative fruitfulness.</p></div></div>`;
