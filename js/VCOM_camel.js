The first kind lives in the Middle East and parts of Africa, while the second is found in Central Asia. All camels are well-suited to life in the desert, going long periods without water and able to withstand high heat. The word <i>camel</i> comes from the Greek <i>kamelos</i>, and may be related to the Arabic <i>jamala</i>, "to bear."</p></div>`;
