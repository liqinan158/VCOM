The adjective <i>impromptu</i> describes things done or said without previous thought or preparation.</p><p class="long"><i>Impromptu</i> is also used as an adverb: Most people are not able to speak impromptu in front of an audience. This word was borrowed from French and ultimately derives from the Latin <i>in prōmptū</i> ("at hand, in readiness") from <i>in</i> ("in") plus a form of <i>prōmptus</i> ("readiness"). As you can guess from the spelling, the adjective and verb <i>prompt</i> are related to <i>impromptu</i>; they are from the same Latin verb, <i>prōmere</i>, "to bring forth."</p></div>`;
