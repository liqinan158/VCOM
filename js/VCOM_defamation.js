If you were so furious at your friend that you spread a rumor that he was still wetting his bed, that would be <i>defamation</i> of your friend.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>defamation</i> describes something very mean and completely deliberate, essentially a false accusation against someone or an attack on a person's good reputation. The terms <i>libel</i> and <i>slander</i> — written or spoken lies about a person, group, or business — both fall under the category of defamation. Sometimes <i>defamation</i> is even a punishable crime, and in every instance it's unkind and malicious.</p></div></div>`;
