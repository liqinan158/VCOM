All of these words are based on a religious idea of <i>heaven</i> as a perfect, blissful existence that's granted to good people after they die. This spiritual heaven is generally depicted as the place where God lives, and is commonly described as being high in the sky. In fact, the original meaning of the Old English <i>heaven</i>, <i>heofon</i>, was "sky."</p></div>`;
