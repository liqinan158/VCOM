Before their invention, people used the words <i>clock</i> and <i>oven</i>, and everyone knew what they were talking about. The retronyms <i>analog clock</i> and <i>conventional oven</i> help clarify things now that there are newer types of clocks and ovens. <i>Retronym</i> combines the Latin <i>retro</i>, "backward," with <i>nym</i>, from the Greek <i>onoma</i>, or "name."</p></div></div>`;
