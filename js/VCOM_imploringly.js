People act <i>imploringly</i> when they really need help.</p><p class="long">Have you ever had someone look at you with big puppy-dog eyes, hands pressed together, saying "Please, please, help me with this?" They looked at you — and spoke to you — imploringly. A beggar on the street might look at you imploringly with his hand out. A kid might look at her mom imploringly when the ice cream truck goes by. This is a strong word for when people really need or want something and are trying hard to get it.</p></div></div>`;
