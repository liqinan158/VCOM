It’s a thin, savory, crisp biscuit, like a saltine. It’s also anything that cracks, like a fire<i>cracker</i> or a computer code <i>cracker</i>, or of course, that thin, savory snack that cracks when you break it.</p><p class="long">Besides a baked wafer, another kind of cracker is a noisemaker — either a small firework that makes a sharp bang, or the kind that snaps loudly when you pull its colorful paper wrapper apart. <i>Cracker</i> can also be used as an offensive term for a white person, particularly one who's Southern and poor. This meaning comes from the sense of <i>crack</i> as "brag," and a cracker, therefore, as a "bragger."</p></div></div>`;
