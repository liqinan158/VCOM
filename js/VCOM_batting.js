When you make a quilt, you sew the front to the back with a layer of <i>batting</i> in between.</p><p class="long"><i>Batting</i> is sometimes called <i>wadding</i> in the UK. It's usually made of cotton, and it adds thickness and warmth to a blanket. You might see batting used as imitation snow in a department store window, as well. The word comes from the now-obsolete <i>bat</i>, "felted mass of fur or wool," from the idea of "beaten" or "batted" fabric.</p></div>`;
