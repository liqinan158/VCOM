To cut to the chase, <i>circumlocution</i> means to beat around the bush.</p><p class="long"><i>Circumlocution</i> comes from the Latin words <i>circum</i>, "circle," and <i>loqui</i>, "to speak." So circumlocution is speaking in circles, going round and round in a wordy way without ever getting to the heart of the matter. It's an evasive style of argument, best employed when you really don't want to say what's on your mind.</p></div></div>`;
