A <i>gob</i> of pizza dough has to be flattened into a large circle before you can top it with sauce and cheese and bake it in the oven.</p><p class="long">A <i>gob</i> can be a hunk of something slimy or yucky â€” you might avoid stepping on an unidentified gob on the sidewalk. You can also eat a gob of cookie dough or mold a gob of clay. Roald Dahl introduced the Everlasting Gobstopper in his novel "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" as a form of candy that would last forever. A more old fashioned meaning of the word <i>gob</i> is "a sailor." While the origin of this kind of <i>gob</i> is a mystery, the "lump" meaning comes from <i>gobbet</i>, "fragment," rooted in the Old French <i>gobet</i>, "piece or mouthful."</p></div></div>`;
