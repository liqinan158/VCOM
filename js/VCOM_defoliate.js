When your mom asks you to defoliate the rose bushes, she wants you to trim them back.</p><p class="long">In <i>defoliate</i> you see part of the word <i>foliage</i>, which means “leaves.” When your family takes a trip to Vermont to look at the foliage, you’re going leaf peeping. If the trees of Vermont are defoliated, there'll be nothing to look at on your leaf peeping trip except the poor quality black and white television in your motel room. The adjective <i>defoliated</i> describes a tree or bush that has had its leaves stripped.</p></div>`;
