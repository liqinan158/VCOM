Your birthday will always be a date that jumps out at you with a lot of <i>salience</i> or importance.</p><p class="long"><i>Salience</i> comes from the Latin <i>salire</i>, meaning "to leap." Something with salience leaps out at you because it is unique or special in some way. This could be an issue — like health care reform, or a day — like 9/11, or even something someone said — like the State of the Union address. If it jumps out at you as remarkable or special, it's characterized by a quality of salience.</p></div></div>`;
