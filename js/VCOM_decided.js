If you have a decided preference for classical music, you'll probably get Bach for your birthday and not the Beatles.</p><p class="long"><i>Decided</i> comes from the verb <i>decide</i>. If something has been decided, the question has been answered. So when we use <i>decided</i> as an adjective, we mean that there is no question about it. If you have decided political views, you won't be swayed by any debate. <i>Decided</i> can also mean distinct, as in a decided splash of yellow paint on your red car.</p></div>`;
