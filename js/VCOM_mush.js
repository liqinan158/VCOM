That bowlful of <i>mush</i> your grandfather gave you for breakfast might be oatmeal.</p><p class="long">Mush is a soggy mass, and cornmeal mush is a kind of porridge that fits this description. Mush is also something so overly sentimental that it's almost disgusting: "Oh, that movie was terrible, just a bunch of romantic <i>mush</i>!" When you use <i>mush</i> as a verb or an exclamation, it's usually in the context of dogsledding, meaning "Go!" or "Move forward!" This last meaning comes from the French <i>marche</i>, "walk" or "go."</p></div>`;
