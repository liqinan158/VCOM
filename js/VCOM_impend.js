As you're heading into a haunted house, you might have the feeling that spooky noises and lurching monsters <i>impend</i>.</p><p class="long">While you're more likely to see the adjective form of this word, <i>impending</i>, used to describe something that's looming or coming up in the future, you can also use the verb <i>impend</i> when something is approaching or developing. You could say, for example, that winter <i>impends</i> when the leaves have all fallen off the trees and the temperature has dropped. The Latin root is <i>impendere</i>, "hang over or be imminent," from <i>pendere</i>, or "hang."</p></div></div>`;
