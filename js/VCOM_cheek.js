Your <i>cheeks</i> might turn bright red in embarrassment when you have to speak in public.</p><p class="long">When you cry, your cheeks get wet, and when you greet your grandmother, she might give you a kiss on the cheek or even pinch your cheek. Informally, your <i>cheeks</i> are also your buttocks or bottom â€” and when you're a little rude or sassy, your attitude itself can be called <i>cheek</i>. It comes from the Old English word <i>ceace</i>, "jaw," which probably stems from <i>ceowan</i>, "chew."</p></div></div>`;
