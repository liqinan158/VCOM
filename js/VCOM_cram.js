You might be tempted to <i>cram</i> your mouth full of your mom's chocolate chip cookies, especially if they just came out of the oven and are still warm and gooey.</p><p class="long">You can cram yourself with food, or cram your books onto a shelf that's not quite big enough to hold them. A writer might cram one book with dozens of characters, or you could cram homemade pancakes with blueberries. Another way to <i>cram</i> is to study for a test all in one session: "I haven't studied at all yet â€” I'll have to stay up tonight and <i>cram</i>." The Old English root, <i>crammian</i>, means "stuff something into something else."</p></div></div>`;
