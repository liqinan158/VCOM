If you say something in a <i>peremptory</i> manner, you want people to stop what they’re doing and do what you say. <i>Peremptory</i> comments put an end to a discussion, and that’s final!</p><p class="long">The word <i>peremptory</i> comes from the Latin <i>peremptorius</i> for “decisive, final.” Trace it further and find that <i>peremptor </i> means "destroyer," from <i>perimpere</i> for "destroy, cut off.” Basically, peremptory commands destroy the conversation. They are given with an air of authority, and they are often barked. In the courtroom, peremptory orders are not open to appeal; they’re final. Outside of the courtroom, a peremptory manner is just plain rude.</p></div>`;
