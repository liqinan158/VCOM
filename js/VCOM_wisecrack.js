The class clown is usually famous for their <i>wisecracks</i>.</p><p class="long">You can use this informal word as a verb, too: "How can I know when you're serious if you just wisecrack constantly?" <i>Wisecrack</i> first appeared at the start of the 20th century, from a now-uncommon sense of the verb <i>crack</i>, "speak loudly or boastingly," which is also used in the phrase "to crack a joke." It takes more than wisecracks to be a successful comedian, but it's a good start!</p></div>`;
