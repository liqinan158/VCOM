Your sister, although she's an adult, might jump up and down clapping her hands in a <i>kittenish</i> way whenever she wins a game.</p><p class="long">Many behaviors that are common in children are considered kittenish in grown ups, especially women. A kittenish spirit might be part of an actress's signature style, for example, and you could also call kittenish behavior <i>coquettish</i> or <i>coy</i>. The word stems from the idea "playful as a kitten," and <i>kitten</i> is from the Old French <i>chitoun</i>, "little cat."</p></div></div>`;
