To be sure, it's a nasty job, but someone has to do it!</p><p class="long">The ancestry of the word <i>epidemiology</i> comes from the Greek word <i>epidÄ“mia</i>, meaning "prevalence of disease." Although the actual term didn't come about to describe the study of epidemics until 1802, the Greek physician Hippocrates is called "the father of epidemiology" for being the first to study the relationship between diseases and the environments that influences them. The study of epidemiology covers a wide variety of diseases, including infectious, chronic, and neurological diseases, and even includes the study of  injuries.</p></div></div>`;
