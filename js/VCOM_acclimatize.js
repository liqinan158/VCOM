var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">acclimatize</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you get used to a new situation or climate, you <i>acclimatize</i> to it. People who travel to very hot countries in the summer find it takes quite some time to <i>acclimatize</i> to the heat.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>acclimatize</i> is usually followed by the word "to," and while you can use it to essentially mean "get used to the weather," it can also refer to new situations. A new student will acclimatize to her new school, and an African immigrant will need to acclimatize to many unfamiliar conditions in the US. <i>Acclimatize</i> comes from <i>acclimate</i>, and in many cases has replaced it â€” both come from a French root, <i>acclimater</i>.</p></div>`;
