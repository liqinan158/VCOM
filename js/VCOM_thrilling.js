Roller coasters are <i>thrilling</i> for some peopleâ€”other people just find them nauseating.</p><p class="long">If your heart is beating fast and you feel absolutely elated, something thrilling is happening. Some of us find it thrilling to speak in front of a crowd or to dive into a cold lake. It's also thrilling to see your favorite movie star in person or to get a poem published in a magazine. The adjective <i>thrilling</i> comes from the verb <i>thrill</i>, which originally meant "pierce," and later "give a shivering excitement" or "pierce with emotion."</p></div>`;
