It is a strong word, so don't call someone odious unless you want to accuse someone of being loathsome or vile. Actions can also be called odious. A typical use is Shakespeare's in <i>Othello</i>: "You told a lie, an odious damned lie." Some synonyms are <i>hateful, contemptible, detestable,</i> and <i>abominable</i>.</p></div>`;
