The person in charge of the <i>arbitration</i> acts like an official referee, helping both sides come to an agreement.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>arbitration</i> comes to English via the Latin word <i>arbitrari</i>, meaning "to judge." In English, <i>arbitration</i> is both the process of using an <i>arbiter</i> to settle a dispute and the act of that arbiter making a judgment. Many parents know that if the arbitration of your kids' argument was deemed unfair by both kids, you've usually made the right decision.</p></div>`;
