Just as a young duck is called a "duckling," a young tree is called a <i>sapling</i>.</p><p class="long">The suffix "-ling" comes from Old English and often shows up today at the end of words to mean "young" or "youngster." Brothers and sisters are called siblings. A baby goose is called a gosling. Someone who works under you is called an underling. The way to remember the meaning of <i>sapling</i> is that trees make "sap" â€” the sweet, sugary liquid that, in sugar maples, gets turned into syrup. A young tree, then, is known as a <i>sapling</i>. One day, it'll make sap.</p></div>`;
