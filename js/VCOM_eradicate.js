When you yank that weed up by the roots, it has been <i>eradicated</i>; it's not coming back. <i>Eradicate</i> often means to kill a bunch of somethings, like what you want the poison to do to the roach family and their extended relatives living in your house, and what we thought we did to bedbugs. You can also <i>eradicate</i> corruption, poverty, or diseases. Although there are all kinds of things to get rid of, we usually want to only <i>eradicate</i> the bad things.</p></div>`;
