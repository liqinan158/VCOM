An <i>avalanche</i> is a whole lot of falling snow and ice. Also, life can feel like an <i>avalanche</i> when things get hectic.</p><p class="long"><i>Avalanche</i> may be a fun word, but it's not a fun thing. If you were in a real, literal avalanche, then a huge amount of snow, ice, rocks, and mud would be falling off a mountain â€” potentially on to you. People get killed in avalanches. On the other hand, if every teacher in school gives you homework on the same night, that is "an <i>avalanche</i> of schoolwork." You'll survive it, but it's not much fun at the time.</p></div></div>`;
