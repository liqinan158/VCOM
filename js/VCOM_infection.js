Some, like meningitis, an <i>infection</i> of the tissues covering the brain and spinal cord, can be deadly. Others, like the common cold, are relatively mild.</p><p class="long">If you've ever scraped your knee and ended up with a swollen, achy scab, you know that you can develop an infection if you don't tend to your cuts and wounds and keep them clean. Though the word was traditionally used in the medical sense to refer to the pathogens, or germs, that cause illness, <i>infection</i> is now sometimes used in a broader sense to refer to people or things that act like pathogens. If rival gangs turn a neighborhood into a battleground, you could refer to this as an infection of gang activity.</p></div></div>`;
