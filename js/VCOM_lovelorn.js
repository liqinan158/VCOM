Sometimes people are <i>lovelorn</i> when the person they love doesn't love them back.</p><p class="long">You could be lovelorn because of unrequited love, loving someone who's unavailable or who simply doesn't feel the same way; or lovelorn from the loss of love. A lovelorn poet might write a melancholy sonnet, and a lovelorn teenager might listen to sad songs and cry in his room. The poet John Milton is often credited with coining <i>lovelorn</i>, a combination of <i>love</i> and <i>lorn</i>, a very old-fashioned way to say "lost" or "ruined."</p></div>`;
