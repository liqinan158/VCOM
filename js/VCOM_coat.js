When the days get short and chilly, it's probably time to start wearing your puffy winter <i>coat</i>.</p><p class="long">A coat is a necessary garment during the winter in most parts of the world. You can also use the word to mean "layer," like when you paint your house, starting with a coat of primer. Another kind of coat is the one your dog, or any furry animal, has: "I brushed my cat's <i>coat</i> until it shone." <i>Coat</i> comes from the Old French <i>cote</i>, "tunic or overgarment," with its Turkish root <i>kotta</i>, "coarse cloth."</p></div></div>`;
