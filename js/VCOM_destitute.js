When you're destitute in the sense of being poor, you're technically "<i>destitute</i> of money." You can be destitute of other things as well. If all your friends have abandoned you, you're "<i>destitute</i> of friends." If you are applying for a job as a waitress but have never worked in a restaurant in any capacity, you're "<i>destitute</i> of experience."</p></div>`;
