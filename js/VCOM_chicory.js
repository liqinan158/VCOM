In many parts of the world, including New Orleans, <i>chicory</i> is commonly added to coffee.</p><p class="long">Roasted and ground chicory root has frequently been used as an affordable substitute during coffee shortages. What started as a desperate move in wartime and during the Great Depression became a beloved tradition in some places, where chicory-coffee mixtures are now considered a regional treat.
