If your marriage turns your feuding families into one big happy group, you pulled off a <i>unification</i> that would make Romeo and Juliet jealous.</p><p class="long"><i>Unification</i> comes from the word <i>unify</i>, which traces back to the Middle French word <i>unifier</i>, meaning "to make into one." Unification often happens in the corporate world, and you might have heard the term <i>merger</i> used to describe this process. If two or more companies decide to become a single company in order to benefit their business, they must first go through a legal process to complete the unification.</p></div></div>`;
