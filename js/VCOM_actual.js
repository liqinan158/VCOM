You might excitedly tell your friends that you saw an <i>actual</i> bald eagle land on your mailbox.</p><p class="long">Use the adjective <i>actual</i> when you want to emphasize that something is certain or confirmed, especially when it's different from what you expected. For example, you might say, "The <i>actual</i> length of my cousin's visit was three weeks, even though she said she'd stay three days." The Old French root is <i>actuel</i>, "now existing," from the Latin word <i>actus</i>, "a doing, driving, or impulse."</p></div>`;
