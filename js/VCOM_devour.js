If you sit down to start a book and look up ten hours later having turned the last page, you have <i>devoured</i> that book. If your after school job <i>devours</i> all your free time, chances are your grades are going to drop. The Latin root, <i>devorare</i>, means "to swallow down."</p></div></div>`;
