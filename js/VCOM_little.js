If you live in a <i>little</i> cottage, it means your house is very small, and quite possibly adorable.</p><p class="long">The word <i>little</i> describes something tiny and sweet, like a little kitten or a little doll house rocking chair. <i>Little</i> can also mean some, but not much, like when you only want a little soup â€” not a big bowl, or when you put little effort into your appearance when you are doing yard work.  The expression <i>little by little</i> means very slowly, or by tiny increments, like learning a new language little by little.</p></div></div>`;
