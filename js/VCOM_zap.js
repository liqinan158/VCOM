So characters in the Star Wars movies zap each other with light sabres, but the only zapping you do is when you zap your cold pizza in the microwave. While some credit the 1940s comic <i>Buck Rogers in the Twenty-Fifth Century</i> with the first <i>zap</i>, it was probably coined about 20 years earlier.</p></div></div>`;
