They are dead.</p><p class="long">The word <i>deceased</i> has been around since the 15th century, however, when people talk of someone's having died, they rarely use <i>deceased</i> in conversation. For example, if you ask someone how their dog is and their dog is recently <i>deceased</i>, they'll most likely use a less technical phrase such as "no longer with us," or "passed away." The word <i>deceased</i> is more formal, and most often used in the documentation of death or in legal situations, as in "we are here to read the will of the <i>deceased</i>."</p></div>`;
