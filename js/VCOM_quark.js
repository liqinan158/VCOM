When <i>quarks</i> combine, they form another type of particle called a "hadron." If you want to learn more, take up particle physics.</p><p class="long">Quarks are held together by what physicists call "the strong force" or "the strong nuclear force." The most stable of these quark combinations, or hadrons, are protons and neutrons â€” the basic building blocks of atoms. In the 1960s, a physicist named Murray Gell-Mann named these particles from a favorite made-up word in James Joyce's book "Finnegan's Wake," <i>quark</i>. Gell-Mann's partner reportedly preferred the word <i>ace</i>.</p></div></div>`;
