Arriving at a new school almost always requires that you <i>adjust</i> a little. Once you <i>adjust</i>, you'll find you're as happy as you were in your old school.</p><p class="long">To <i>adjust</i> doesn't mean to transform in a major way. It implies small but important changes that make a big difference. If you adjust your speed by just ten miles per hour, you'll get more than fifty more miles per fill-up. You can adjust your hair to make it fancier, you can adjust your lifestyle to make it more sober, or you can adjust your attitude to make yourself less annoying. You used to have to adjust your TV antenna to get a better picture. Ask your mom.</p></div>`;
