When you are studying for a difficult history exam, the desire to be somewhere far away doing something fun might be very strong!</p><p class="long"><i>Desire</i> can be used as both a noun and a verb. Is your boyfriend your heart's desire? Your parents probably desire your punctual appearance at the dinner table every evening. <i>Desire</i> is usually used not just when you long for any old thing, but for something that is associated with giving great pleasure. Thus, you might want to get an A on a test, but you desire a piece of chocolate cake.</p></div></div>`;
