A school snow day is a godsend if you're not quite ready for your chemistry midterm, and your homeowner's insurance is a godsend when a huge tree falls on your roof. In both of these examples, you are relieved and happy, and if you're a believer, you might say, "Thank God." In Middle English, it's <i>Godes sonde</i>, "gift from God."</p></div></div>`;
