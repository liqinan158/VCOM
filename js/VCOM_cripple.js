Terrible car accidents, for example, can sometimes <i>cripple</i> their victims.</p><p class="long">Use the verb <i>cripple</i> to describe what is done to a person whose legs are so badly injured that they can't be used. You can also use the word in a figurative way, as when a parent's criticism and high expectations cripple a child's self esteem. In other words, they take away his strength and make him feel useless and unsuccessful. In the thirteenth century, <i>cripple</i> meant "to move slowly," from the Old English root <i>crypel</i>, "to bend."</p></div></div>`;
