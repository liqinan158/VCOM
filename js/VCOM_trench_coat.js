Movie spies and detectives are commonly shown wearing <i>trench coats</i>.</p><p class="long">The classic version of a trench coat is made from waterproof beige cotton, belted, and extends below the knee. Trench coats were developed during World War I as a lighter alternative to the heavy serge coats typically worn by soldiers. The shoulder straps that many trench coats have were used to attach military rank insignia, and the name <i>trench coat</i> implied that officers wore them in the trenches during wartime.</p></div>`;
