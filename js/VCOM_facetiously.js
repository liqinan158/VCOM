You might walk into your brother's room and <i>facetiously</i> say, "Wow, it's really clean in here."</p><p class="long">People who say things facetiously are being a little bit sarcastic, saying one thing and meaning another, or treating a serious subject in a funny way. A disappointed friend might, for example, say facetiously, "That was the best birthday ever, especially since no one remembered!" The adjective <i>facetious</i> came first, and it means "flippant or joking," from the French <i>facétie</i>, "a joke." The Latin root is <i>facetia</i>, "jest or witticism."</p></div>`;
