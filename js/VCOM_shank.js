It's most common to talk about shanks in terms of meat, like lamb shanks or beef shanks, rather than your own shins. The shape of lower leg bones influence other ways <i>shank</i> is used, to refer to objects from drill bits to the narrow piece of a shoe's sole that connects to its heel. For unclear reasons, to shank means to hit a golf or tennis ball badly.</p></div>`;
