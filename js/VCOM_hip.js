You might have a habit of closing the refrigerator door by bumping it with your <i>hip</i>.</p><p class="long">Your hips are the flesh between your waist and upper leg, and they're also the bones that make up the complex joints there â€” the ones that make it possible for your legs to move so you can walk. When a person is described as <i>hip</i>, it means they're trendy or cool, up on the latest thing. These two meanings are unrelated, with the "cool" meaning coming from the slang <i>hep</i>, popular with jazz musicians around 1915.</p></div></div>`;
