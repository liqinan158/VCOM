Want to see a <i>redoubt</i>? Go to the US Military Academy at West Point where there are <i>redoubts</i> from the Revolutionary War. Itâ€™s also spelled "redout."</p><p class="long">Redoubts were often built around existing fortifications out of earth or stone to protect the most vulnerable soldiers outside the main area. <i>Redoubt</i> means "place of retreat," and a figurative redoubt might be the comfort you get from your group of friends or even your own certainty about the truth of your beliefs.</p></div></div>`;
