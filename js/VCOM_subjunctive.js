That sounds like something a little kid would say, and it's in a verb mood little kids probably can't name yet: the subjunctive. The subjunctive mood applies to conditional sentences, such as "I wish the new Batman movie were in theaters now." Thoughts expressed in the subjunctive mood are usually possibilities or desires â€” they aren't facts. People often use the subjunctive to talk about what they wish were true.</p></div></div>`;
