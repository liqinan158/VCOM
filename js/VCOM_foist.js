Anything — a person or object or idea — can be <i>foisted</i> if it's done by force upon an unwilling party.</p><p class="long"><i>Foist</i> used to imply a degree of deception rather than just brute force, but that's a meaning that's pretty much lost now: if something's <i>foisted</i> upon you, you know about it. The earlier meaning comes from an old Dutch term for palming a loaded die into a game. Today we call that cheating.</p></div></div>`;
