var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">sappy</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Something <i>sappy</i> lacks substance. It's silly, foolish, and overly sentimental.</p><p class="long">Have you ever heard someone refer to a sappy song? That's not a compliment, because anything sappy is considered cheesy, saccharine, clich√©d, ludicrous, or goofy. Serious or excellent art would never be called sappy. Greeting cards are often sappy, as is someone saying "I wuv you" to his dog. In the 1550s, <i>sappy</i> meant "full of vitality," but by the end of the 1600s its meaning changed to "foolishly sentimental," possibly influenced by the stickiness of sap.</p></div>`;
