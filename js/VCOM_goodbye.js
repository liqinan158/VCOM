You might say <i>goodbye</i> to all your favorite teachers on your last day of high school.</p><p class="long">A goodbye means that someone's departing: you say goodbye to your parents when you go off to college, and you also say goodbye to guests when they leave after a visit. The original goodbye, dating from the 1570s, was <i>godbwye</i>, which was a contraction of the farewell phrase "God be with ye!"</p></div>`;
