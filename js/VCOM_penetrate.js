var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">penetrate</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>penetrate</i> is to force into or pierce through. If the fog is thick as pea soup, your flashlight won’t <i>penetrate</i> it. If you stubbornly ignore good advice, people might say nothing can <i>penetrate</i> that thick skull of yours.</p><p class="long">We get <i>penetrate</i> from the Latin word <i>penetrare</i>, which combines <i>penes</i> ("within") and <i>intrare</i> ("to enter"). <i>Penetrate</i> crops up most often to describe entering or permeating. Blaring music penetrated every corner of the dorm and we wondered how anyone could study with that racket. <i>Penetrate</i> can also mean to decipher or understand: "Careful study allowed us to <i>penetrate</i> the mysteries of Pig Latin." Finally — no surprise, given its Latin roots — the word can be used to describe sexual intercourse.</p></div>`;
