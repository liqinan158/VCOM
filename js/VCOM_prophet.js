How do I know?  Perhaps I am a <i>prophet</i>, someone who can predict the future.  Or maybe it’s just a guess.</p><p class="long">The future is a foggy mystery, but a prophet sees beyond that fog to speak about what’s to come.  A fortune teller is a prophet, and so is a savvy computer designer who knows how technology will change in ten years.  <i>Prophet</i> comes from the Greek word for “spokesman,” which explains another definition of <i>prophet</i>: someone who speaks on behalf of God.  <i>Prophet</i> is pronounced the same as <i>profit</i>, and some prophets use their talents to earn lots of profit.</p></div>`;
