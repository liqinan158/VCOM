If you’ve seen movies with people wearing 1930s clothing fast dancing and spinning around, chances are they’re dancing to <i>jive</i> music.</p><p class="long">You can listen to jive or you can jive, because the word is both a noun and a verb. When you jive, be prepared to do a lot of spinning and swinging. It's often done to a style of big band music called "swing," because the dancers hold hands and swing each other around. <i>Jive</i> also means glib, fancy talk. If you're bragging about things you didn't even do, someone might tell you to quit your jive.</p></div>`;
