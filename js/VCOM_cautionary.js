Your parents might be fond of telling <i>cautionary</i> tales, like the one about the girl who got electrocuted sticking a knife into the toaster.</p><p class="long">While driving, look for cautionary signs warning you of potential danger: falling rocks, kids crossing, hidden driveway. You might use cautionary words: “Watch your step! There’s glass all over the floor!” Don’t confuse <i>cautionary</i> with <i>cautious</i>, which means trying to avoid danger. Tell a cautionary tale about someone drowning because he swam too far out into the ocean and an overly cautious kid might decide never to swim again.</p></div>`;
