It refers to a government with total power, one that exercises complete, even oppressive control over the people and their activities. (You can also figure itâ€™s not nice.)</p><p class="long">The word <i>totalitarian</i> first came about in 1926 as <i>totalitario</i>,  an adjective to describe the Italian fascism of that time. The English form was adapted from the Italian to describe an absolutely powerful regime. Socialist leader Norman Thomas once said: "To us Americans much has been given; of us much is required. With all our faults and mistakes, it is our strength in support of the freedom our forefathers loved which has saved mankind from subjection to totalitarian power."</p></div>`;
