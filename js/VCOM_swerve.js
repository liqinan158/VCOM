As a verb, it means to move off your original route, possibly to avoid a collision. You can <i>swerve</i> either toward something or away from it.</p><p class="long">The word <i>swerve</i> can be traced to the Old English <i>sweorfan</i>, "to turn aside," which is precisely the modern sense. It was first used as a verb in the 13th century and as a noun in the 18th. <i>Swerve</i> refers to a sudden veering off, perhaps not as sharp as a turn, but more a bending of your path. Think of the trajectory as an arc or curve, and remember that <i>swerve</i> rhymes with <i>curve</i>.</p></div></div>`;
