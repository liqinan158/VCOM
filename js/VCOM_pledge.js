You can <i>pledge</i> allegiance to your country, you can <i>pledge</i> to keep a secret, and you can <i>pledge</i> a sum of money to a cause.</p><p class="long"><i>Pledge</i> can be used as both a noun and a verb. As a noun, it can be a solemn promise you've made. Or even the person who makes that promise, like the freshman pledges who take an oath to join a fraternity in college. As a verb, it describes the act of promising. “I <i>pledge</i> you, I <i>pledge</i> myself, to a new deal for the American people,” vowed Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States.</p></div></div>`;
