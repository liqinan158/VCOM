It would be <i>immodest</i> to boast about your experience making movies, especially if all you've actually done is take videos of your dog in the back yard.</p><p class="long">There are two ways to be immodest: the first is to gloat and show off, essentially being the very opposite of <i>modest</i>. The other way is to lack good taste and restraint. Years ago, it would have been considered immodest to wear a bikini to the beach — while today, it's only immodest if you wear one to school or a restaurant. The "arrogant" meaning came before the "improper" one, both from the Latin <i>modestia</i>, "moderation," and "correctness of conduct."</p></div>`;
