Some high school kids hire <i>limousines</i> to take them and their friends to the prom.</p><p class="long">Some limousines are unusually long, stretched-out versions of regular sedans, while others are merely large and luxurious. The passengers in a limousine sit in the back, sometimes separated from the driver, or chauffeur, by a partition. Wealthy people might own their limousines, but most people rent them for special occasions like weddings. In the US, the word is also used to mean a more ordinary type of hired car: "I'll just take a <i>limousine</i> to the airport."</p></div>`;
