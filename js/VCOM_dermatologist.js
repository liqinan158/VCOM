Once visited mainly for acne problems, <i>dermatologists</i> have become more important, as skin problems have grown more common with our increased exposure to the sun.</p><p class="long">You know that an "-logy" at the end of a word means "study" and that "-logist" means "one who studies. In the noun <i>dermatologist</i>, the object being studied is the <i>derma</i>, the Greek word for "skin." (The Greeks also used it to refer to "leather" or "hide," which still works for diehard sun worshipers. And think of elephants being called "pachyderms," with their "thick skin.") <i>Dermatology</i> and <i>dermatologist</i> both appeared in English in the 19th century.</p></div></div>`;
