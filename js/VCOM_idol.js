A statue of a Hindu god is a religious <i>idol</i>, but Madame Curie is an <i>idol</i> to aspiring scientists.</p><p class="long">The word <i>idol</i> comes from the Old French <i>idole</i> for "pagan god," through the Greek <i>eidolon</i> for “reflection in water or a mirror.” In religion, an idol isn’t the real deity but a representation of it. These days, rock stars and celebrities are idols, but so are scientists and writers. If you say Flannery O’ Connor is your idol, you don’t mean you bow down before a statue of the Southern writer, it just means you admire her big time.</p></div>`;
