Maybe you think your feet smell like roses, but if people move far away when your shoes come off, your rosy feet are probably <i>malodorous</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Mal-</i> is used to form words for bad things, and in this case, <i>mal-odor-ous</i> means having a bad odor. Synonyms for <i>malodorous</i> include "smelly," "rank," and "funky" â€” but not funky in a "get on with your bad self" good way, just funky bad. If you walk into a malodorous room, you might start checking the bottoms of your shoes to see if you stepped in something, and if a plate of malodorous food is served, you might cover your nose and mouth.</p></div>`;
