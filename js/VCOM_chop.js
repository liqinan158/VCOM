In many places, there are farms where you can <i>chop</i> down your own Christmas tree.</p><p class="long">When you chop wood, you usually hit it with an axe, splitting each length into narrow pieces. A chef uses a knife to chop, hacking an onion into tiny bits, for example. When it's a piece of meat that's cut so it's attached to a bone, such as part of a rib, it can be described as a <i>chop</i> â€” like a lamb chop. And if someone claps his hands at you and says, "<i>Chop-chop</i>!" he means "Hurry up!"</p></div></div>`;
