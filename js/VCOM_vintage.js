Some wine drinkers can actually identify a wineâ€™s <i>vintage</i> based on smell or taste. Also, this word can refer to things that are old, yet also kind of cool. An antique car is known as a <i>vintage</i> automobile. There are also vintage bikes and watches. Watch out for the word <i>vintage</i> though: sometimes it just means old or used, like a vintage clothing store.</p></div></div>`;
