If you want to find out what it means for yourself, try telling your nasty boss what you really think of him.</p><p class="long">Originally <i>reprobation</i> was a religious word meaning "rejection by God."  The root word <i>probate</i> comes from the Latin word <i>probare</i>, which means "prove."  A probate is someone who proves his worth.  A reprobate was someone who'd proved himself to be worthless, and was therefore condemned to eternal suffering in Hell.  Pretty harsh, huh? Today, a form of the word can even be used affectionately: "You old reprobate!"</p></div></div>`;
