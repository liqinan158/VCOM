John Coltrane and Charlie Parker (and Lisa Simpson :) were famous <i>saxophone</i> players.</p><p class="long">Saxophones are similar to instruments like clarinets, because both use a reed mouthpiece and are considered woodwinds. The saxophone, however, also qualifies as a brass instrument, like the trumpet and the tuba, since it's made out of brass and makes sound through vibrations inside the instrument's body. The word <i>saxophone</i> comes from Antoine Joseph Sax, the Belgian inventor of the saxophone. Sax's father, also named <i>Sax</i>, invented the less successful <i>saxhorn</i>.</p></div></div>`;
