Chairs, baseballs, sofa cushions and sadly, snowmen, are all <i>inanimate</i> objects.</p><p class="long">We can break <i>inanimate</i> down into two Latin roots: <i>in</i>, which means “not,” and <i>animatus</i>, which translates to “alive.” So <i>inanimate</i> means simply, "not alive." That include things that are recently dead, things that were never alive to begin with, and things that simply look dead: A bear in hibernation may appear <i>inanimate</i> due to its decreased heart rate, but don’t be fooled — it’s very much alive.</p></div></div>`;
