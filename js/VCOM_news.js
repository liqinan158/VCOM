Other kinds of news could be about world events or approaching storms or a tragedy that affects your city or town. In the fourteenth century, <i>news</i> literally meant "new things," from a Latin root, <i>nova</i>, or "new." The phrase "no news is good news" has been around since the 1600s.</p></div></div>`;
