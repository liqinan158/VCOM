People who have no freedom are <i>oppressed</i>.</p><p class="long">Being oppressed is a negative and unfair condition. The United States was founded because we felt oppressed by the rule of England. African-Americans, Native Americans, women, gays, and other minority groups have all been oppressed by prejudice and unfair laws. So people who are oppressed tend to be angry â€” and for good reason. Oppressed people tend to fight for their freedom, and they often get it.</p></div>`;
