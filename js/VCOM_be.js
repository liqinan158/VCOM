As Hamlet best put it: "To <i>be</i> or not to <i>be</i>, that is the question."</p><p class="long">The verb <i>be</i> is one of the most frequently used words in English, and it often takes the form of <i>am</i>, <i>are</i>, <i>were</i>, or <i>was</i>. When you make plans to meet someone later, you could say, "I'll <i>be</i> on the steps in front of the library," and when you talk about your goals, you might confess, "I want to <i>be</i> a movie star." It's a verb with a complicated history, stemming mainly from the Old English <i>bÄ“on</i>, "be, exist, or happen."</p></div>`;
