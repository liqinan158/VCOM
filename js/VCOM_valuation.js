Before you sell your old Pokemon cards, you should take them to an expert for a <i>valuation</i>.</p><p class="long">Whenever you determine the monetary value of something, that's valuation. However, you're most likely to come across this word in the context of banking or finance. The valuation of a company affects whether or not investors are interested in it, and the valuation of stocks determines how much a stockholder makes when she sells them. <i>Valuation</i> shares a root with <i>value</i>, from the Latin root <i>valere</i>, "be strong, be worth."</p></div>`;
