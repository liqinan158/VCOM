You may have a <i>knack</i> for baking cakes or a <i>knack</i> for cracking jokes. These things come easy to you.</p><p class="long">Although the noun <i>knack</i> refers to a special talent, the sense is that it is a more innate talent â€” as opposed to a certain technique. So if someone instinctively has a talent for fixing plumbing, for example, you can say they have a <i>knack</i> for it. If, however, they unclog a sink by having a wrench in one hand and a how-to book in the other, then they may have the technique, but they probably don't have the knack.</p></div></div>`;
