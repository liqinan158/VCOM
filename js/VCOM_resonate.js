Your speech about the dangers of scarves and convertibles will <i>resonate</i> with your audience if you tell the story of Isadora Duncan's death.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>resonate</i>, which comes from the Latin <i>resonatum</i>, first referred only to sound, but has now developed an emotional connotation. <i>Resonate</i> sounds a whole lot like another verb, <i>resound</i>, but they have subtly different meanings. <i>Resound</i> means “to repeat the sound,” but <i>resonate</i> means “to expand, amplify.” Sound can resonate when broadcast through speakers, and so can an idea or feeling, when expressed articulately or with passion.</p></div></div>`;
