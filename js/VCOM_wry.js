You were late for work, stepped into a mud puddle, and you forgot your lunch. If your co-worker asks how your morning is going, you can reply with a <i>wry</i> tone, "Perfectly perfect."</p><p class="long">The original use for the adjective <i>wry</i> was to describe something that was bent or twisted, so a sprained ankle could be described as "a <i>wry</i> ankle." Today, the word <i>wry</i> is often used to describe less tangible twists. Wry humor and wry wit both describe a sense of humor that is a little twisted from the norm.</p></div></div>`;
