If you plant a <i>bulb</i>, a flower will pop up. <i>Bulb</i> is also short for light <i>bulb</i>. Donâ€™t try planting that kind, though, because lamps don't grow on trees.</p><p class="long">Garlic, onions, and shallots are all bulbs, and many flowering plants also grow from underground bulbs, like lilies and daffodils. A different type of bulb is a light bulb, which shares the rounded shape of the plant version. The meaning of <i>bulb</i> in the 16th century was simply "onion," from the Greek <i>bolbos</i>, "plant with round swelling on underground stem."</p></div>`;
