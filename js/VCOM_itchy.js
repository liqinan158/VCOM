Mosquito bites are notoriously <i>itchy</i>, and the least fun thing about summer time.</p><p class="long">Poison ivy, hives, bug bites, sunburn, lice â€” all of these things make you itchy, and it might even make you feel itchy just to think about them. A figurative way to be itchy is to be antsy or restless, and if someone has "<i>itchy</i> feet," it means they like to roam or travel, staying on the move. If, on the other hand, they have "<i>itchy</i> palms," they can't be trusted not to steal things.</p></div>`;
