A successful climb like that might also become the <i>pinnacle,</i> or peak, of your success.</p><p class="long">Two synonyms for <i>pinnacle</i> also start with the letter "p," "peak" and "point." A pinnacle can be a physical thing, like the top of a high mountain or the antenna on the very top of a building, or it can be a high point that canâ€™t be measured with a ruler, like an achievement or a goal. Whatever the pinnacle is, reaching it is almost always a completion of something where you have gone the highest you can go. "Acme" is a great synonym for <i>pinnacle.</i></p></div></div>`;
