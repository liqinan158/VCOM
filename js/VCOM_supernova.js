When a star turns into a <i>supernova</i>, it becomes extremely bright.</p><p class="long"><i>Supernova</i> sounds like a superhero, but it refers to the super explosion of a star. A nova is also the explosion of a star, but a supernova has more energy. A supernova happens when a star becomes bright, bursts, and its matter is scattered in all directions, with light and radiation shooting out. Some say our sun will turn into a supernova someday, which would destroy all life on Earth. Don’t worry, that’s a long way off.</p></div>`;
