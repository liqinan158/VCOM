You might be called a <i>dolt</i> if you do something dumb, like stand outside your car complaining that you locked your keys inside — even though the window is wide open.</p><p class="long">Let's be honest — you never want to be called a dolt. And if you're a kind person, you'll never call anyone else a dolt — unless they do something so frustratingly stupid that you can't take it anymore. <i>Dolt</i> probably came from the Middle English word <i>dullen</i>, meaning "to dull, make or become dazed or stupid." To help remember what <i>dolt</i> means, say it out loud, with gusto. With its guttural sound, the word itself sounds not very bright.</p></div>`;
