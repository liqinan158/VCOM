But the word is also a verb that means to avoid making a definitive decision.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>waffle</i> seems to have its origins in the 1690s as the word <i>waff</i>, "to yelp," possibly in imitation of the yelping of dogs. The word soon came to mean "to talk foolishly" and then eventually "to vacillate, to change." The food term <i>waffle</i>, as part of "<i>waffle</i> iron," appeared in 1794, a descendant of the Dutch word <i>wafel</i>, which comes from the same Germanic source as <i>weave</i>: it's easy to see the waffle pattern as similar to a woven fabric.</p></div>`;
