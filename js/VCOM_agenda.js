If you're going to attend a meeting with a long <i>agenda</i>, you'll want to take your coffee mug along.</p><p class="long">The word <i>agenda</i> is the plural for of the Latin word <i>agendum</i>, which literally means "something to be done." The noun retains this meaning  because an agenda is a plan — organized by time — of events or things to do. You might have a meeting, a lunch date, and a doctor's appointment on your agenda for the day. And when you run for office, you better have a political agenda — or a plan for what you want to get done if elected.</p></div>`;
