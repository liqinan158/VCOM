By the sixteenth century the word had taken on the additional meaning of “sound harshly” and “annoy.” This evolution makes sense if you think about it: If you’ve ever had anything really annoy you — "<i>grate</i> on your nerves" — it can almost seem as if a cheese grater has been applied to your nerves and is slowly ripping them to shreds.</p></div></div>`;
