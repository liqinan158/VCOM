The 19th century character Madame Bovary became a widow because of it. Today, we generally call it "a stroke," but <i>apoplexy</i> sounds way better.</p><p class="long">Although <i>apoplexy</i> as a specific medical term is not such a common term now, the word <i>apoplectic</i> certainly is, meaning furious and red-faced with uncontrollable rage (so called because its symptoms of flushed red face and loss of bodily control mimic those of apoplexy). Often used humorously — <i>apoplectic</i> is how you might describe your parents when they see your grades — though there's nothing funny about a real apoplectic fit.</p></div>`;
