A good cooking knife should have its <i>blade</i> sharpened regularly.</p><p class="long">Knives, swords, and razors have blades, metal edges so fine and thin that they can cut and slice. The shoulder bone is sometimes called a "shoulder <i>blade</i>," and a piece of grass is also a <i>blade</i>. In fact, the original meaning of the Old English <i>blæd</i> was "leaf," and then "something resembling a leaf." In the 14th century, the word was applied to swords, based on their shape — similar to a leaf or blade of grass.</p></div></div>`;
