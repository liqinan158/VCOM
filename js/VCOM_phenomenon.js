Scientists used it (and still do) to describe any event or fact that could be observed, amazing or not. An earthquake, for example, was a phenomenon, because you could see it (and hear it and feel it). <i>Phenomenon</i> is an example of a word having a specific meaning for one group of people that gets changed when used by the general public.</p></div>`;
