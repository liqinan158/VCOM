Nothing can put you to sleep quite as effectively as a teacher talking in a <i>monotone</i>.</p><p class="long">The Greek word for "one tone" is <i>monotonia</i>, which is the root for both <i>monotone</i> and the closely-related word <i>monotonous</i>, which means "dull and tedious." A continuous sound, especially someone's voice, that doesn't rise and fall in pitch, is a monotone. When someone speaks in a monotone, his voice is flat and boring â€” plus listeners don't know how the speaker is feeling when everything sounds the same.</p></div>`;
