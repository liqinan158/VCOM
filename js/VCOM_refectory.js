It is usually used to describe a dining hall in a religious institution, like where monks eat together.</p><p class="long">The word <i>refectory</i> comes from the Latin word <i>reficere</i> which means "to restore, renew." A meal together is a great way of restoring unity to a group. Nothing renews community like a great dinner, and the conversation that occurs around it. Lunch in your school's refectory? Maybe not so much.</p></div></div>`;
