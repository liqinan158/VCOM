While chemotherapy is a powerful tool for keeping cancer cells from reproducing, it can often make people feel quite sick because it kills other cells as well. The word literally means "treatment of diseases by chemicals," from the German <i>Chemotherapie</i> and its roots, the scientific prefix <i>chemo-</i>, "chemical," and the Greek <i>therapeia</i>, "healing."</p></div></div>`;
