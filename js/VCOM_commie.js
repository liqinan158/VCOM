You shouldn't call someone a <i>commie</i> unless you want to start a fight.</p><p class="long">A commie is a communist, a person who favors the eventual creation of a classless society in which goods are equally shared between all citizens. This word was most common in the 1950s, during the strongly anti-communist era of the US. Being called a commie back then might result in losing a job or being ostracized by friends. Today, you're much less likely to hear the word <i>commie</i>, which has the same root as <i>communism</i>, the French <i>communisme</i>, from the Old French <i>comun</i>, "common, free, open, or public."</p></div></div>`;
