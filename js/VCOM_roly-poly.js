Your fat little Corgi puppy is extra adorable because she's so <i>roly-poly</i>.</p><p class="long">A chubby baby, with dimpled elbows and fat little legs, could be described as roly-poly. When you use this word as a noun for a plump person, it's especially derogatory, but the baby bears at the zoo won't mind being called roly-polies. When someone talks about a roly-poly bug, they mean a pill millipede or a woodlouse, a small insect that can protectively roll itself into a ball.</p></div></div>`;
