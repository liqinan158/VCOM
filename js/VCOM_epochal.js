In other words they're "epoch-making."</p><p class="long">The big bang. The moment when man learned to make fire. The day your braces were removed. These events are epochal in that they mark the dawn of a new era, or epoch, of time. Both <i>epoch</i> and <i>epochal</i> derive from the Latin <i>epocha</i>, which in turn derives from the Greek <i>epekhein</i>, which combines <i>epi</i> "on" with <i>ekhein</i> "to hold," and means to pause or take up a position. Think of epochal events as worthy of an arrow on the timeline of history.</p></div></div>`;
