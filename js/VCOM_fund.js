You can start a <i>fund</i> for almost anything, such as your child’s education, a new car, or the establishment of the world’s largest origami collection.</p><p class="long"><i>Fund</i> can be used as a verb meaning “provide funds for something.” If you’re unable to save up the money to start your origami collection, you might ask a friend to fund it. (We predict she’ll say no.) An organization that raises money for a particular, often charitable, purpose can also be called a fund. We doubt an origami collection warrants its own fund, but there's no harm in trying.</p></div></div>`;
