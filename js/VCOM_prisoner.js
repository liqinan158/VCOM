During wartime a <i>prisoner</i> is someone held captive by the enemy. Alternately, if you’re so attractive you can’t leave the house, you’re a <i>prisoner</i> of your own good looks.</p><p class="long">Someone who's caught robbing a bank or stealing a car will probably become a prisoner, locked inside a prison for as long as the sentence specifies. If you feel stuck or confined in some way, you may consider yourself a metaphorical prisoner, like an actor who whines that he’s a prisoner of his own success, since he’s not able to go anywhere without cameras flashing and fans screaming.</p></div></div>`;
