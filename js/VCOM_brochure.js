var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">brochure</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">An organization wishing to advertise its products or services will often create a <i>brochure</i>, a small booklet or folded paper giving brief details about what it's selling. It usually includes illustrations and is made to be eye-catching and easily read.</p><p class="long">Small booklets or pamphlets used to be stitched together, and from that stitching we get the word <i>brochure</i>, which comes from the French verb <i>brocher</i>, "to stitch," and thus means literally "a stitched work." The word enters English in the mid-18th century. Today brochures of many pages are usually stapled. A common style of brochure is a single sheet, often folded in thirds to make it the right size to fit inside an envelope.</p></div>`;
