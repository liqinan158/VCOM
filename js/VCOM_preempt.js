Let them eat liverwurst! <i>Preempt</i> means to displace or take something before others can.</p><p class="long"><i>Preempt</i> combines the Latin prefix <i>prae-</i>, "before," with <i>emere</i>, "to buy." Think old-fashioned land grabs and midnight madness sales. It can also mean to replace one thing with another thatâ€™s more important. For instance, if the president is speaking or the football game is running long, brace yourself: the network just might preempt your favorite show.</p></div></div>`;
