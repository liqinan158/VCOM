More complicated, formal place settings include extra plates, forks, spoons, and knives for different courses, as well as several glasses for an assortment of beverages. You might add a cloth napkin rolled inside a napkin ring, a placemat, and even a card at each place with a guest's name on it. So fancy!</p></div>`;
