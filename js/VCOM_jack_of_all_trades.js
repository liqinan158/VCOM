You might think of yourself as a <i>jack of all trades</i> if you can program computers, fix plumbing, and bake a mean cupcake.</p><p class="long">Someone who's a jack of all trades is typically — though not necessarily — a man. While you can describe someone this way who is very good at many different types of jobs and projects, there's sometimes an implied ending to the phrase <i>jack of all trades</i>, which goes like this: <i>and master of none</i>. In other words, a person who dabbles in things but never gets really skilled at any one thing. Both versions of the phrase have been used since the 1600's.</p></div>`;
