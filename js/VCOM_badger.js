A <i>badger</i> is an animal that digs tunnels under ground to keep warm. To <i>badger</i> can also mean to persuade someone through constant annoying efforts. You might <i>badger</i> your mom to add another hour to your curfew or <i>badger</i> your friend to give you a turn with a video game he has been hogging.</p></div>`;
