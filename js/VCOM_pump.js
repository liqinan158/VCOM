If you’re pumped about this word, you can put on <i>pumps</i>, <i> pump</i> up the volume, and <i>pump</i> some iron!</p><p class="long">When you use the device called a pump, you pump water or gas. Other things that force some liquid or gas to move, also pump: your heart pumps blood, and your foot pumps the brake of your car when you're stopping on an icy road. If you pump iron, you lift weights. If you’re pumped, you’re excited. “<i>Pump</i> Up the Volume” was a hit song in 1987, so turn it up. A pump is also a woman's dress shoe.</p></div>`;
