You can <i>depend</i> on your most loyal friend to show up for your modern dance performance in the park (although you probably can't <i>depend</i> on her liking it).</p><p class="long"><i>Depend</i> can also mean "determined by or contingent on something else." For example, if rain is in the forecast, your outdoor dance performance may be cancelled; it depends on the weather. <i>Depend</i> is almost always followed by the word <i>on</i> or <i>upon</i>, with <i>upon</i> being more formal. If you're speaking informally, you may drop the <i>on</i> or <i>upon</i>, as in "It all <i>depends</i> how you feel." Your decision to do that will, of course, depend upon your audience.</p></div></div>`;
