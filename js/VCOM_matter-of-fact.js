A matter-of-fact letter to the editor is practical and factual, and a kid's matter-of-fact apology for breaking his neighbor's window will take responsibility and offer a sincere "I'm sorry." A matter-of-fact news report doesn't sensationalize facts, but simply states them. Originally, <i>matter-of-fact</i> was a legal term meaning "portion of an enquiry concerned with truth or falsehood."</p></div></div>`;
