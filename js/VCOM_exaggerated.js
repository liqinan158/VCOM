Your <i>exaggerated</i> details stretched the truth, but they sure made your story funny and memorable.</p><p class="long">Something that is exaggerated is described as better or bigger than it actually is, like your exaggerated description of the terrible day you had. <i>Exaggerated</i> can also describe something that is oversized, like the exaggerated collar on a funky sweater. The original meaning of <i>exaggerated</i>, in the early 1500s, was "piled up or accumulated." To spell <i>exaggerate</i> correctly, think of <i>bragger</i>.</p></div>`;
