If your legs <i>stiffen</i> during a long plane flight, you'll want to stretch them out once you land.</p><p class="long">You can stiffen something deliberately, like when you stiffen a package with cardboard to protect it in the mail. You can also stiffen in reaction to something: "The spooky creaking sounds upstairs made us <i>stiffen</i> in terror." The earliest sense of this verb was "make steadfast," from a now-obsolete meaning of <i>stiff</i>, "gain strength."</p></div></div>`;
