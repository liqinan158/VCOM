A slightly different way to underpin is to form the basis or foundation of something: "A philosophy of empathy and kindness underpins all the interactions at my wonderful summer camp." This verb can also be used in a more literal way, to mean "support from below," the way the foundation of a house underpins everything that's built on top of it.</p></div>`;
