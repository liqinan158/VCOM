If you forget to put oil in your car and you blow the engine, it's going to cost you an awful lot to <i>repair</i> it.</p><p class="long">Not only does <i>repair</i> describe the act of fixing something, it can also be used as a noun for the fixing itself, as in “Who did the <i>repair</i> on this house? It looks terrible!” In a totally different meaning, if you repair somewhere, you return back to or go to a place for rest or shelter. If you're outside and it begins to rain, you might want to repair to the house where it's dry.</p></div>`;
