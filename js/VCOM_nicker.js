The horse you've been visiting with carrots every afternoon might <i>nicker</i> softly when she sees you coming.</p><p class="long">The word <i>nicker</i> comes from Scottish and North England dialect. Horse experts will tell you that while a neigh is usually louder, often a call to people or other horses, a nicker is a softer sound, more of a vibration of the vocal cords. Mares nicker gently at their new foals, and many horses nicker at their favorite humans.</p></div>`;
