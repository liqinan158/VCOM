Your <i>cavernous</i> basement is huge, damp, and dark, but fortunately there are no bats down there.</p><p class="long"><i>Cavernous</i>, "cavern," and "cave" all come from the same Latin root word <i>cavus</i>, meaning hollow. Anything that's vast or deep can be described as <i>cavernous</i>, like your favorite professor's cavernous knowledge about the subject of 17th century literature. As a medical or anatomical term, <i>cavernous</i> refers to something that is porous, particularly when it's filled with tiny blood vessels.</p></div>`;
