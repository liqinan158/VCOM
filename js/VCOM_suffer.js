You'd probably do anything you could to be sure your beloved cat didn't <i>suffer</i> when she got old and sick.</p><p class="long">You can suffer from the pain of a broken leg, but you can also suffer from shyness, regret, poverty, or any number of unpleasant things. You can even describe something that becomes worse using the word <i>suffer</i>, like when someone's grades suffer during soccer season. The root of <i>suffer</i> is the Latin word <i>sufferre</i>, to bear, undergo, or endure. That's why someone who doesn't suffer fools gladly won't put up with nonsense.</p></div></div>`;
