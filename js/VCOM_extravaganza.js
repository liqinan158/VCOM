When the word appeared in English in the mid-18th century, English speakers turned the <i>estra-</i> into <i>extra-</i> because after all, an elaborate entertainment could certainly be called something "extra." Aida at the Baths of Caracalla, complete with horses, astonishing costumes, and faux-Egyptian temples — now that's an <i>extravaganza</i>.</p></div></div>`;
