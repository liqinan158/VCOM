A racial prejudice is a negative attitude towards a group of people based on race â€” not on direct knowledge or experience. If you prejudice someone, you cause them to have a negative attitude towards someone else. Lawyers are not allowed to bring certain types of evidence such as rumors into a trial because it might prejudice the jury.</p></div>`;
