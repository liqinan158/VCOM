If your friend Dolores is crying about a lost puppy, you could call her <i>dolorous</i> Dolores.</p><p class="long">Music written in a minor key can have a dolorous effect. It sounds really sad, and can make you feel the same way. <i>Dolorous</i> shares the same root with the word, condolence, an expression of sympathy with someone's sadness. Both of these words come from the Latin word for grief, <i>dolor</i>, which in current Spanish happens to mean pain.</p></div>`;
