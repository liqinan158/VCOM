The <i>centralization</i> of a school district might mean the superintendent makes important decisions for all the schools, rather than leaving those choices to individual principals.</p><p class="long"><i>Centralization</i> can refer to the consolidation of operations, like the centralization of a company's distribution, so that all the products they make are shipped out from one central warehouse. However, it often refers to the consolidation of power or control. When centralization occurs in a government, it means a small group increasingly controls everything; the disadvantage to extreme centralization is that there aren't enough checks and balances to that power.</p></div>`;
