People who are nostalgic about the past are often taking an ahistorical perspective, choosing not to think about advances in civil and human rights through history. The word <i>ahistorical</i> dates from 1950, combining <i>a</i>, "not," and <i>historical</i>, "concerning past events."</p></div></div>`;
