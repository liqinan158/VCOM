Desk chairs are often designed so the seat can <i>swivel</i> atop the base. In the hospital, the TV is usually mounted on a <i>swivel</i> so that patients can adjust it.</p><p class="long"><i>Swivel</i> comes from a middle English word, <i>swive</i>, meaning to sweep.  It’s often used to describe gun mountings, like on a tank or a boat where a gun is fastened down but can still be swung around in any direction. But people can also swivel. If you were in the middle of robbing a bank and you heard a noise behind you, you’d probably swivel around quickly to see what it was.</p></div></div>`;
