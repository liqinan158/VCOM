In either case, the thing that makes something <i>equinoctial</i> is its proximity to the dates in the spring and fall when the Earth isn't tipped toward or away from the sun but is positioned so the equator lines up with it. The Latin roots are <i>aequus</i>, "equal," and <i>nox</i>, "night."</p></div>`;
