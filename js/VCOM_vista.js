It's what you stop to see when you climb to the top of a mountain, or pull off the road at the "scenic view" rest stop.</p><p class="long"><i>Vista</i> is an Italian word that means "sight" or "view." It's the same in Spanish and is related to the verb <i>avistar,</i> which means "to catch sight of." <i>Hasta la vista!</i> means, literally, "Until I see you!" (or, more simply, "See you later!"). As in Spain and Mexico, we like to name our towns after a vista: Buena Vista ("great scenery"), Chula Vista ("pleasant view"), and Rio Vista ("overlooking the river") are all places in California.</p></div>`;
