var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">nee</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the word <i>nee</i> when you refer to a person's original, birth name. If your neighbor was Mary Jones until she got married to Larry White, you could introduce her to someone else as "Mary White, <i>nee</i> Jones."</p><p class="long">If a woman marries and adopts her husband's last name, her former name becomes a thing of the past. If your grandmother's maiden name was "Smith," describe her as <i>nee</i> Smith. This works when people change their names for reasons other than marriage as well. <i>Nee</i> comes from the French <i>n√©e</i>, the feminine past participle of <i>naitre</i>, "to be born."</p></div></div>`;
