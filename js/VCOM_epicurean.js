Thus the "good life" was one filled with pleasure and the avoidance of pain. Over the centuries, <i>epicurean</i> has come to refer to the pursuit of the finer things in life, and the word has a whole host of great synonyms, including <i>luxurious,</i> <i>voluptuous,</i> <i>hedonistic,</i> and, as a noun, <i>bon vivant</i>.</p></div>`;
