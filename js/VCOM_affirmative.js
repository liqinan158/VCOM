A formal way of saying "Yes" is <i>"Affirmative</i>!"</p><p class="long">Anything affirmative is approving of something: affirmative words support someone or something. Being affirmative is the opposite of being negative or contradicting. A pat on the back is affirmative so is a signature you need to complete a form. Also, you can use <i>affirmative</i> as a formal way of saying <i>yes</i> to something. This is common in the military. It might sound a little odd, but if your teacher asked, "Does 10 plus 10 equal 20?" you could answer, "Affirmative!"</p></div>`;
