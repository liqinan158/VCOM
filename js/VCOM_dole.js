In the U.S., the noun <i>dole</i> is rare, but when it's used it means "any charitable gift." When local businesses hold a toy drive during the winter holidays, those donations are dole given to needy families. As a verb, <i>dole</i> is most commonly used in the phrasal verb "dole out," although you'll sometimes see it used on its own.</p></div></div>`;
