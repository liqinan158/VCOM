Whether you have a doctor’s appointment, a hair appointment, or a 1 o’clock lunch appointment, you need to be there — or you’ll have a broken appointment. It’s easier to remember your appointments if you write them down! With roots in the Old French <i>apointier</i>, meaning to “arrange, settle, or place," <i>appointment</i> can also mean the placing, or <i>appointing</i> of, someone into an unelected position.</p></div>`;
