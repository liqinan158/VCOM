A <i>straggling</i> group of students going inside after recess might need to be herded and encouraged to move toward the door.</p><p class="long">You might watch geese flying south for the winter, moving in perfect formation, and then far behind spy a straggling group of less organized birds. When something's straggling, it is lagging behind and sprawling out in various directions. It comes from the verb <i>straggle</i>, or "wander from the proper path" as of 1400. It's believed to come from a Scandinavian root, related to the Norwegian word <i>stragla</i>, "to walk laboriously."</p></div>`;
