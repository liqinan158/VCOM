Though the counterculture was strong in America in 1968, voters elected Richard Nixon, the <i>antithesis</i> of a hippie.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>antithesis</i> comes from a Greek root meaning "opposition" and "set against." It's often used today when describing two ideas or terms that are placed in strong contrast to each other. We might come across <i>antithesis</i> in school if we learn about the "Hegelian dialectic." There, the <i>thesis</i>, or main idea put forward in an argument, is countered with its opposite idea — the <i>antithesis</i> — and the two are finally reconciled in a third proposition, the <i>synthesis</i>. An <i>antithesis</i> wouldn't exist without a <i>thesis</i> because it works as a comparison.</p></div></div>`;
