A <i>demonstrative</i> person might shout "Hooray" and jump for joy at good news. A non-demonstrative person might feel no less excited, but refrain from demonstrating it.</p><p class="long">To <i>demonstrate</i> means to show, so think of <i>demonstrative</i> as showing. In legal terms, <i>demonstrative</i> is used to describe evidence that shows that something happened––a note that says "I did it" might show, or demonstrate, an accused person's guilt. In grammar, demonstrative pronouns––this, that, these, those––indicate the thing or person that is being pointed out, or shown, as in “Officer, it was ‘that’ man who stole my purse!”</p></div></div>`;
