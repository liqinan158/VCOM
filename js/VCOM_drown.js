It is possible to <i>drown</i> in even a small amount of water, so it's important to learn proper water safety.</p><p class="long">You can also use this verb with a direct object: for example, a flash flood might drown animals that live near a river.  You can drown things in a less literal way as well. If you drink alcoholic beverages to forget your troubles, for example, you can say you're trying to "drown your sorrows." If you're submerged in a tidal wave of school assignments, then you are "drowning in work."</p></div></div>`;
