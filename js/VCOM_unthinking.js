Your unthinking prejudice against a certain breed of dog, for example, might be undermined when you actually meet a sweet Doberman. And your unthinking run through your Dad's flower garden to catch a football may instantly fill you with regret: if you'd stopped and thought about it, you wouldn't have done it.</p></div>`;
