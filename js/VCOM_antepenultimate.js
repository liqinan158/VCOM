If you're the <i>antepenultimate</i> fan in line at a book signing, there are only two people standing behind you.</p><p class="long"><i>Ultimate</i> is the last or best, <i>penultimate</i> is the second to last, and finally <i>antepenultimate</i> is the third from last. This fancy adjective comes from the Latin linguistic term <i>antepaenultima</i>, "third from last syllable in a word," and its roots are <i>ante</i>, "before," <i>paene</i>, "almost," and <i>ultima</i>, "last." Want to sound impressive? Try using it when you're reading your favorite book: "I’m on the antepenultimate chapter — just two more to go before the book ends!"</p></div>`;
