If you’ve studied a foreign language, you know that sometimes you can <i>conjugate</i> a verb just by changing its endings.</p><p class="long">To conjugate the verb <i>to be</i>, you’d say “I am,” “you are,” “she is,” and so on. You’re changing the form of the verb to make it agree with the subject. You might conjugate other words to make them agree in number, gender, or tense. In chemistry, <i>conjugate</i> means "to join together." It can also be an adjective, meaning "joined," or "joined in pairs," like the conjugate leaf of an Oak tree.</p></div></div>`;
