A cartoon <i>pirate</i> wears an eye patch, three-cornered hat, billowy shirt, and tall black boots.

You can also use <i>pirate</i> as a verb to describe what these robbers do. Today, in addition to traditional pirates, there are pirates who use digital creative material, like books, movies, games, and music, without paying for it.
