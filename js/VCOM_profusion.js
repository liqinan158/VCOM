So you can think of <i>profusion</i> as an outpouring of something â€” an overflow or cornucopia of it. An area known for wine making should have a profusion of grapes growing along the hillsides. And an awesome performance should garner a profusion of compliments and shouts of "encore!"</p></div></div>`;
