Your brother's magic trick might be truly remarkable, or it may be nothing but a bunch of <i>razzmatazz</i>.</p><p class="long">The razzmatazz of a politician's television ads can hide the fact that she doesn't really have anything new to say about the issues, and the razzmatazz of a marching band's fancy uniforms might distract from the fact that the instruments are all out of tune. The noun <i>razzmatazz</i> probably came from <i>razzle-dazzle</i>, or "showiness," and it's probably also connected to <i>jazz</i>, both the word and the music itself.</p></div></div>`;
