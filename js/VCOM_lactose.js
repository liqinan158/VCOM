Some people have trouble digesting <i>lactose</i> and avoid eating dairy products. No cheese stick for you!</p><p class="long">You might learn about lactose in chemistry class, including the fact that it's made of two sugars, glucose and galactose. Lactose is broken down into these simpler sugars by lactase, an enzyme that most of us have plenty of. However, if you're one of the people without enough lactase, eating food with lactose can be unpleasant. The <i>lacto-</i> comes from the Latin <i>lac</i>, or "milk," and the chemical suffix <i>-ose</i> tells you it's a sugar.</p></div>`;
