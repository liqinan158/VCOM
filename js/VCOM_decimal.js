Instead of writing 1/2, for example, you can express the fraction as the <i>decimal</i> 0.5, where the zero is in the ones place and the five is in the tenths place.</p><p class="long"><i>Decimal</i> comes from the Latin word <i>decimus</i>, meaning tenth, from the root word <i>decem</i>, or 10. The decimal system, therefore, has 10 as its base and is sometimes called a base-10 system. <i>Decimal</i> can also specifically refer to a number in the decimal system. As an adjective, <i>decimal</i> means something related to this numbering system. The decimal point, for example, refers to the period that separates the ones place from the tenths place in decimal numbers.</p></div></div>`;
