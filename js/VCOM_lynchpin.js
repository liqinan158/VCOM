var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">lynchpin</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>lynchpin</i> is a vitally important person or an essential element. You could say that a star player is the <i>lynchpin</i> of the team, or that technology is the <i>lynchpin</i> of the California economy.</p><p class="long">Without the lynchpin, a group or project just won't work, won't go as smoothly, or will be otherwise less successful. The lynchpin of many bands is a great lead singer, and the lynchpin of a bountiful vegetable garden is rich, healthy soil. This figurative meaning of <i>lynchpin</i> (which is also spelled <i>linchpin</i>) comes from the literal definition: a pin that keeps a wheel attached to an axle.</p></div>`;
