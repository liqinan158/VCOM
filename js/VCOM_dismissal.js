Your friend's <i>dismissal</i> from the pizza place where he kept dropping the dough on the floor means he's looking for a new job â€” preferably not in food service.</p><p class="long">When a school bell rings at the end of the day, signaling that students can leave, that's one kind of dismissal. Bad news from a boss that the company is laying you off is also a dismissal, and when a judge rules that a trial is over and the case has been dropped, it's yet another kind of dismissal. The word comes from <i>dismiss</i>, "send away," from the Latin root <i>dimittere</i>, "send different ways" or "break up."</p></div>`;
