Your English teacher might return the rough draft of your paper covered with red marks and a request to tone down the <i>sesquipedality</i>.</p><p class="long">You couldn't ask for a longer, fancier, or more complicated word than <i>sesquipedality</i> to describe the use of long, fancy, complicated words. This formal noun comes from the slightly more common adjective <i>sesquipedalian</i>, "long, long-winded, or having many syllables," which was itself originally a noun meaning "something measuring a foot and a half long." The Latin root is <i>sesquipedalia verba</i>, "words a foot and a half long."</p></div></div>`;
