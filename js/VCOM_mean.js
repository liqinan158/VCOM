The adjective <i>mean</i> can describe someone who's stingy or ungenerous, but it also means "unkind or unfair," which is what a little kid intends to convey when she yells at her mother, "You're <i>mean</i>!" In the sentence, "She lived in a <i>mean</i> little house," <i>mean</i> has yet another meaning, this time being "shabby or poor."</p></div>`;
