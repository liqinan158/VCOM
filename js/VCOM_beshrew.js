Horrified at discovering an empty baking pan, you might yell, "<b>Beshrew</b> all of you who ate my brownies!"</p><p class="long">The verb <i>beshrew</i> is so old fashioned that you're most likely to discover it in a play or poem by Shakespeare, who used it frequently. When the Nurse in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> says, "Beshrew your heart for sending me about, to catch my death with jaunting up and down!", what she means is "Curse you for making me run around so much!" <i>Beshrew</i> comes from <i>shrew</i>, an animal believed to have a poisonous bite.</p></div></div>`;
