Some people consider <i>idealists</i> to be naive, impractical, and out of touch with reality. <i>Idealists</i> think that striving for perfection makes the world a better place.</p><p class="long">The main root of <i>idealist</i> is "ideal," which comes from the Latin word <i>idea</i>. As an idealist, you think everyone should act in the best interest of the group. Ideally, everyone would agree with you, but the unfortunate reality is that lots of people act solely in their own self-interest. Words that are related to <i>idealist</i> include "idealize," "idealism," and "ideally."</p></div>`;
