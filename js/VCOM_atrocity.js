If you go to visit a poorly run prison, you might be overwhelmed by the atrocity of the place when you see that no one is treated with respect, and torture is rampant. The word <i>atrocity</i> is also often used in the context of warfare and frequently as a plural. There were numerous atrocities on both sides, as the war raged on and the fightersâ€™ capacity for cruelty seemed to increase.</p></div></div>`;
