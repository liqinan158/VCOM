var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">league</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The two meanings of <i>league</i> are quite different — either it’s a group or federation joined for a common purpose (say, your bowling league or the League of Nations) or it’s a rough measurement of about three miles, usually at sea.</p><p class="long">One would hope that two such different meanings of the same word would have some deep connection far back in word history, but it does not seem to be the case here. The word meaning "an agreement of groups" appears to be related to the French word <i>ligue</i>, also found in <i>ligature</i> ("thing that ties"), while the <i>league</i> of <i>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</i> (an excellent adventure book if you’re in the mood) is from Middle English. We call words like these <i>homographs</i> — since spelling is all they seem to share!</p></div>`;
