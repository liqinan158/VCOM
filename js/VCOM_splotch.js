Some people get bright red <i>splotches</i> on their faces when they blush.</p><p class="long">Be careful when you're eating something messy in your brand new shirtâ€”you might end up with splotches of barbecue sauce or watermelon juice all over yourself. You can also use this informal word as a verb: "The artist began to splotch pink paint randomly across the canvas." <i>Splotch</i> first appeared around 1600, possibly from a combination of <i>spot</i> and <i>blot</i>. The similar <i>splott</i> in Old English meant "a patch of land."</p></div></div>`;
