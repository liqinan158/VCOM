You might call out, "<i>Ciao</i>!"and wave as your brother steps off the train at the station.</p><p class="long">While <i>ciao</i>, pronounced "chow," is a casual Italian salutation that can mean both "hello" and "goodbye," most English speakers understand it as well. You can say, "<i>Ciao</i>, Grandma!" when your favorite grandparent comes to visit, or wave goodbye to a departing neighbor and yell, "<i>Ciao</i>!" The word is a shortened version of the formal Italian <i>schiavo</i>, "your obedient servant," or literally, "I am your slave."</p></div>`;
