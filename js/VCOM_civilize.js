You might try to <i>civilize</i> your younger brother by teaching him some table manners.</p><p class="long">You can attempt to civilize your crazy dog, so you can invite people over without having her jump on them and chew on their shoes. You can also civilize a person by teaching them to be more sophisticated or tasteful: "My aunt tried to <i>civilize</i> me by taking me to museums and ballets, but I preferred watching professional wrestling on TV." The Latin word <i>civilis</i> is at the root of <i>civilized</i>, meaning "befitting a citizen" or "courteous."</p></div></div>`;
