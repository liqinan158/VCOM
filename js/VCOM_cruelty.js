Years of <i>cruelty</i> by their leaders can cause citizens to rise up together and revolt.</p><p class="long">Keeping a dog tied up outside all day and all night is animal cruelty, while kids' endless bullying of a classmate is another kind of cruelty. In both examples, people act in a coldhearted way that causes another being to feel terrible. The Latin root of <i>cruelty</i> is <i>crudelis</i>, "rude, unfeeling, or hard-hearted," which is related to <i>crudus</i>, "rough, raw, or bloody," the root of <i>crude</i>.</p></div></div>`;
