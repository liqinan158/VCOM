You might wake on Christmas morning to find your stocking full of <i>bagatelles</i>.</p><p class="long">Use the noun <i>bagatelle</i> when you're talking about something that's purely decorative, like a bauble or knickknack, or that's very easily done. For example, you might say, "Oh watching your cat was such a bagatelle — I really didn't have to do a thing!" The word is French, meaning "knick-knack, bauble, or trinket," from the diminutive form of the Latin <i>baca</i>, or "berry."</p></div>`;
