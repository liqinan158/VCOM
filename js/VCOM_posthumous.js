var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">posthumous</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If something happens after someone dies, it is described as <i>posthumous</i> — like the <i>posthumous</i> interest in the music of a singer who died "a nobody."</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>posthumous</i> comes from Latin — <i>post</i> means "after" and <i>humare</i>, "to bury." (You might also think of <i>humus</i>, which means "dirt" or "earth.") So something that is posthumous happens after a person is dead, like the posthumous discovery that your humble neighbor who lived very modestly was actually a multi-millionaire, or the posthumous publication of a book that the writer finished just before she died.</p></div></div>`;
