var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">accuse</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If you charge someone with misdeeds or misconduct, you <i>accuse</i> that person. If the last piece of devil's food cake is missing, your sister may <i>accuse</i> you of eating it — especially if you have chocolate on your mouth.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>accuse</i> comes from the Latin word <i>accusare</i>, which itself is formed from the roots <i>ad</i>, meaning toward, and <i>causa</i>, reason or lawsuit. "Cause," "excuse," and even "ruse" are all from that same root word. Today, if you're accused of a crime, you may still be headed toward a lawsuit. However, to accuse someone of a crime doesn't necessarily make them guilty — plenty of people have been falsely accused.</p></div>`;
