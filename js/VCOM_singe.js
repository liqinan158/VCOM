If you get too close to your backyard fire pit, you might <i>singe</i> your shirt sleeve.</p><p class="long">When you singe your finger on a hot stove, it hurts, and when you singe your scarf on a campfire, you'll smell it starting to burn. The verb <i>singe</i> comes from the Old English root word <i>sengan</i>, "to burn lightly, or to burn the edges." One trick to the word <i>singe</i> is that when you add an <i>ing</i>, you need to be sure you keep the <i>e</i> â€” otherwise, instead of <i>singeing</i>, you'll be <i>singing</i>.</p></div>`;
