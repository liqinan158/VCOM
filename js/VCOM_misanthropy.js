So people with this character trait aren't much fun at parties.</p><p class="long">If you're full of misanthropy, then you don't care too much for other people â€” you're a <i>misanthrope</i> who basically hates everyone else in the world. Misanthropy isn't about disliking specific people, but disliking human beings in general. That makes misanthropy different from sexism or racism, which are prejudices aimed at specific types of people. If you're a fan of misanthropy, you'd better get a dog, because no one else will want to hang out with you.</p></div>`;
