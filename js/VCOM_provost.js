That's because this is a type of high-ranking administrator at a college or university. The provost usually ranks higher than the deans (who head different departments) but not as high as the president of the school. The provost is involved with many important decisions for the school. This word originally referred to a religious leader, and it still carries a lot of authority.</p></div></div>`;
