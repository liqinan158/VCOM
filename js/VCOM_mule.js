A <i>mule</i>, however, can not make babies â€” since it has an odd number of chromosomes (63, to be exact).</p><p class="long">While donkeys can be notoriously stubborn and horses can be fragile, mules are sturdy, patient, and live long lives. Mules always have a donkey father and a horse mother, while the opposite combination (a female mule and male horse) is called a hinny, and it's less common. A completely unrelated definition of <i>mule</i> is a slip-on shoe or slipper. This second meaning is from the Latin <i>mulleus calceus</i>, the footwear of Roman patricians, "red high-soled shoe."</p></div>`;
