If you and your best friend are convinced that her dog can speak English, it may be a <i>folie a deux</i>.</p><p class="long">When two people have the identical delusion — believing something is true which clearly could not be — it's called a <i>folie a deux</i>, or sometimes a "shared psychotic disorder." This unusual disorder is more likely to occur in a closely related pair, like twins, or a married couple, who are isolated from other people. <i>Folie à deux</i> means "shared madness," or "madness for two" in French. If three people share the delusion, it's a "folie a trois."</p></div>`;
