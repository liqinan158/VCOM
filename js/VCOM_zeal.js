If you have <i>zeal</i>, you're willing, energized, and motivated.</p><p class="long"><i>Zeal</i> is often used in a religious sense, meaning devotion to God or another religious cause, like being a missionary. Zeal doesn't have to be religious, though: a feeling of gusto and enthusiasm for anything can be called <i>zeal</i>. People have zeal for sports teams, bands, causes, and (often, but not always) their jobs. If you have passion for something, you have zeal, which is kind of a mix of eagerness and energy and devotion.</p></div></div>`;
