If someone winds up in jail, the guards there will demand the prisoner's <i>submission</i>. Alternatively, this word can refer to something that you submit to someone else. If you write an article and send it into a magazine to see if they will publish it, your article would be called a <i>submission</i>. Good luck!</p></div>`;
