If your grandmother has a pillow with "Home Sweet Home" stitched on it, it's probably a work of <i>needlepoint</i>.</p><p class="long">When you do needlepoint, you use various colors of a thick thread or an even thicker yarn, stitching it through a stiff material with an open, grid-like weave. Using a pattern or your own design, your needlepoint creation might, for example, be a portrait of a cat you can on the wall or make into a pillow. Another type of needlepoint is lace that's made with a needle â€” this is the earlier meaning of the word, from the mid-1800s.</p></div></div>`;
