A winter road could be <i>icy</i>; and, if you give someone an <i>icy</i> stare, they are going to feel like hitting the road.</p><p class="long">Use the adjective <i>icy</i> to describe your town's slippery sidewalks in the winter or the frosty peas you just removed from the freezer. You can also describe very cold conditions as <i>icy</i>: "I'm putting my long underwear on â€” it's <i>icy</i> out there!" When a person is icy, they are aloof and unemotional, as opposed to warm and friendly. This figurative meaning has been around since the late 1500s.</p></div></div>`;
