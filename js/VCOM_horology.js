Specifically, <i>horology</i> involves the measurement of time and the making of clocks.</p><p class="long">You need a small leap of imagination to see <i>hour</i> in <i>horology</i>, but if you do, you've pretty much nailed the meaning: it refers to the study of time and the art of making timepieces. In horology, time is studied scientifically, just as a geologist studies the earth and a biologist studies life. Horology is very practical, since it involves the design and construction of clocks, watches, and other devices for measuring time. Someone who studies horology is a horologist.</p></div></div>`;
