If your favorite caf√© is so crowded that there's barely room to stand, let alone find a place to sit, you might say there are a <i>zillion</i> people in there.</p><p class="long">Use <i>zillion</i> when there are so many things or people that it would be hard to count them all. <i>Zillion</i> sounds like an actual number because of its similarity to <i>billion</i>, <i>million</i>, and <i>trillion</i>, and it is modeled on these real numerical values. However, like its cousin <i>jillion</i>, <i>zillion</i> is an informal way to talk about a number that's enormous but indefinite. Experts believe it started as 1920s African-American English slang.</p></div></div>`;
