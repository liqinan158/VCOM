Your brother <i>unwisely</i> decided to ride his skateboard down the playground slide, and now he's got a cast on his arm.</p><p class="long">Things that are done unwisely are foolish or lack judgment. If you unwisely decide to adopt a dozen dogs from the local shelter, you'll almost certainly regret it. And if you unwisely borrow your mom's car to drive to the mall, despite not having a driver's license, you'll be in deep trouble. We get <i>unwisely</i> from the prefix <i>un-</i>, "not," and the Old English source of <i>wise</i>, <i>wis</i>, "sagacious or prudent."</p></div>`;
