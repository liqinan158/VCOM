To thrust is to try to stab, and to <i>parry</i> is to avoid getting stabbed by blocking a thrust. Though it comes from fencing, <i>parry</i> is also handy in dodgeball and awkward conversations</p><p class="long">The word <i>parry</i> means to block or evade a movement, like in fencing, but it can also refer to an evasion that is verbal rather than physical. If someone asks you who you have a crush on, but you don’t want to answer, parry the question — change the subject or ask a question in return. When used in this way <i>parry</i> retains its sense of defending yourself through evasion.</p></div>`;
