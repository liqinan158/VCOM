The <i>moon</i> is our planet’s satellite, and it rotates around the earth and reflects light from the sun. Also, “to <i>moon</i>” means to show your rear. The <i>moon</i> is out! Giggle giggle.</p><p class="long">The earth has just one moon, but the word <i>moon</i> can mean any natural satellite of any planet. Astronomers have discovered many moons — there are more than 160 in our solar system alone. Poets have been fascinated by the moon for a long time, and "to <i>moon</i>" also means "to act in a dreamy or aimless way." Our months are marked by changes in the moon's phase, and the Proto-Indo-European root means both "moon" and "month."</p></div></div>`;
