In fact, with its Biblical feeling, itâ€™s most often used in religious contexts. Otherwise, it might be used as slang for <i>thousand</i>.</p><p class="long">Anyone familiar with the Bible knows the word <i>thou</i> means "you." As the word worked its way from Old English, it varied a little in its subtext, from a plural referring to higher-ups, then to equals, and, around 1450, as a slightly insulting reference suggesting inferiority. Today, it's used primarily by specific religious groups, or as a somewhat affected, archaic word in poetry. As a side note, if someone asks you for a thou, they mean a thousand dollars.</p></div></div>`;
