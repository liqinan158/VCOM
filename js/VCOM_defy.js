You can <i>defy</i> the no-costumes-in-class rule if you wear your fairy wings to school, but just don’t try to <i>defy</i> the laws of gravity unless you can actually fly.</p><p class="long">If you deliberately break a rule or ignore an order, you defy, or resist, that rule. The word <i>defy</i> comes from the Latin word <i>disfidare</i> for "renounce one's faith." So if you're expected to be faithful to a certain law or rule but you refuse to be, you defy it. There are different ways to defy — defy your parents by staying out past curfew, or defy common sense by walking in with shoes on your head.</p></div>`;
