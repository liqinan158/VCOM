Biologists use the phrase "nuclear <i>matrix</i>" to refer to the material left behind after DNA is extracted from a cell's nucleus. A <i>matrix</i> is an environment or structure in which something originates or develops.</p><p class="long"><i>Matrix</i>, related to the Latin word for "mother," originally meant "pregnant animal" or "breeding female" and was later generalized to mean "womb." Today, <i>matrix</i> includes any nurturing or supportive setting or substance usually within the fields of math and the sciences â€” except in the cinematic trilogy starring Keanu Reeves, of course. <i>Matrixes</i> is an acceptable plural form, but you can use <i>matrices</i> if you want to show off your knowledge of Latin noun endings.</p></div>`;
