You can <i>remain</i> at home instead of going out to the movies with your friends, but that doesn't mean you won't <i>remain</i> friends.</p><p class="long">If things remain the same, they don't change, and if your family remains in the same town, they don't move. When something is left behind, it also remains: "All that <i>remains</i> of my party is a bunch of deflated balloons." In the fifteenth century, <i>remain</i> was a noun too, meaning "people or things left over or surviving." Today we use <i>remainder</i> instead.</p></div>`;
