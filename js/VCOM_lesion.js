Usually a <i>lesion</i> involves a break or wound to the skin, so protect it with a bandage so that it heals quickly.</p><p class="long"><i>Lesion</i>, pronounced "LEE-zhun," comes from the Latin word <i>laesionem</i> meaning "injury." Lesions on the skin are usually not very nice to look at, the kind of wounds that might make you grimace â€” things like open sores, cuts, deep scrapes or puss-filled gashes. Lesions also are a concern of doctors because if lesions develop without explanation, it can be a sign that your immune system is dangerously weak.</p></div>`;
