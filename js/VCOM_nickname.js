If your name is David, but your friends call you "Dave," that's your nickname. If your sweetheart calls you "Honey," that's also a nickname. And if your coworkers call you "Skinny," there's your third nickname. Before the fifteenth century, the word was <i>ekename</i>, "an additional name," from the Old English <i>eaca</i>, "an increase."</p></div></div>`;
