Some <i>indigestion</i> can be avoided by chewing slowly and not eating a large pepperoni pizza for breakfast.</p><p class="long">If your stomach feels uncomfortable after a big meal, or you can't stop burping, it's probably indigestion. Some people know what food gives them indigestion, whether it's ice cream, fried foods, or hamburgers, and in many cases indigestion can be soothed with medicine or home remedies like ginger tea or peppermint. <i>Indigestion</i> adds the "not" prefix <i>in-</i> to <i>digestion</i>, which comes from the Latin root <i>digestus</i>, "digested thing."</p></div>`;
