In fiction a <i>vagrant</i> often is a criminal, but a real-life <i>vagrant</i> might just be a person who has lost a job and family and lives off the streets with help from charity.</p><p class="long">Many synonyms for <i>vagrant</i> imply laziness and criminal behavior, such as "bum," "tramp," and "vagabond," and some vagrants do make money through crime. Often, though, a vagrant is a down-on-his-luck person who has lost work, family, or health and lives on the streets. European roots for <i>vagrant</i> point to "wander" or "wander about," and a vagrant is a wanderer â€” a man or woman without a place to call home.</p></div></div>`;
