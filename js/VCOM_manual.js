Before Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin, picking cotton was a <i>manual</i> job. Nowadays, farmers might need to read a <i>manual</i> to know how to operate a cotton gin.</p><p class="long">The word <i>manual</i> comes from Latin root words meaning "of the hand," and the adjective form of the word still maintains that meaning â€” "by hand or of the hands." The adjective definition is also extended a bit to mean something done by hand and not machine, and the implication is usually that it is physical work. As a noun, <i>manual</i> means "an instruction booklet or handbook."</p></div>`;
