Occasionally writers still use the phrase "the whys and <i>wherefores</i>," to mean all of the underlying causes of something. Possibly the most famous use of the word is in "Romeo and Juliet," when Juliet says, "<i>Wherefore</i> art thou Romeo?" She doesn't mean "where are you?" but "why are you Romeo," or "why do you have to be a Montague, enemy of my family?"</p></div>`;
