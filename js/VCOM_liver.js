All vertebrates (animals with spines) have a <i>liver</i>.</p><p class="long">In humans, the liver sits in the upper right-hand side of the abdominal cavity, nestled just above the stomach. Livers are powerful organs, able to break down harmful substances and remove them from your system, produce bile that allows you to digest fat, help your blot to clot, and much more. Many people consider the livers of certain animals to be a delicious delicacy.</p></div></div>`;
