A little kid may use Elmer's <i>glue</i> to decorate an art project, and you may use Krazy <i>Glue</i> to repair a mug's broken handle. Whatever the case, you hope the <i>glue</i> sticks.</p><p class="long">Most glue comes in a squeeze bottle and is used in small drips and lines to paste one material to another, but some glue comes in solid sticks that aren't as messy. When you stick one thing to another with glue, you <i>glue</i> it. The Old French source of <i>glue</i> is <i>glu</i>, from the Latin <i>gluten</i>, which means both "glue" and "beeswax."</p></div></div>`;
