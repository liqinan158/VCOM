It's also influenced by the earlier <i>bridgehead</i>, a defended position at one end of a bridge. As troops on a beachhead wait for reinforcements, they take a position that's safe and secure, from which they can defend themselves and anticipate advancing further. Figuratively, a beachhead can also be the first step you take toward achievement or progress.</p></div>`;
