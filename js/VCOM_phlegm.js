It's hard to sleep when you have a bad cold and your throat is full of <i>phlegm</i>.</p><p class="long">Your body's respiratory system creates phlegm, pronounced "flem," which becomes thicker and more annoying when you're ill. The thick substance you cough up when you have a terrible cold is phlegm. We don't talk about phlegm all that often these days, but it was very important in medieval science â€” it was thought that too much phlegm led to apathy and laziness, and it was a sign that the body was out of balance.</p></div></div>`;
