You might run into a <i>wayfarer</i> on a hiking trail, midway on his journey from Georgia to Maine.</p><p class="long">Sometimes the word <i>wayfarer</i> is used to describe someone who doesn't simply go on a hike, but who always seems to be restless, especially a journeying literary character. One of the most well-known, classic brands of sunglasses is the Ray-Ban Wayfarer, in production since the early 1950s. <i>Wayfarer</i> combines <i>way</i> with <i>farer</i>, from an Old English root, <i>f√¶r</i>, "journey, road, passage, or expedition."</p></div>`;
