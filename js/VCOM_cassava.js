In tropical countries, <i>cassava</i> is a common staple food.</p><p class="long">The most cassava is grown and eaten in Nigeria, and it's popular in many places because it grows even when there's not much rain or the soil is poor. Experts estimate that 800 million people depend on cassava. It has to be properly prepared to be safely eaten, either cooked like potatoes or ground into a coarse meal or fine flour. Tapioca, a starch found in pudding and bubble tea, is also made from cassava.</p></div></div>`;
