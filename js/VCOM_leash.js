The word <i>leash</i> is also useful for describing a figurative kind of guide or restraint: "The teachers at that school keep their students on a short <i>leash</i> when they take field trips downtown." The students aren't on actual leashes, but they are constrained. <i>Leash</i> comes from the Old French word <i>laissier</i>, or "loose."</p></div>`;
