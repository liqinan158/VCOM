When your <i>unwary</i> cousin travels to China, he might end up being overcharged for a rickshaw ride.</p><p class="long">When you don't know the potential dangers or challenges that lie in front of you, you're unwary. While unwary people aren't overly suspicious or cautious, they run the risk of being taken advantage of or even getting hurt. To be <i>wary</i> is to be very watchful or cautious — it comes from the Old English root <i>wær</i>, "prudent, aware, or alert," and <i>unwary</i> combines it with <i>un</i>, or "not."</p></div>`;
