When temperatures rise <i>precipitously</i> in the winter, the melting snow can cause dangerous flooding.</p><p class="long">The adverb <i>precipitously</i> is useful for perilously steep things, like when you nervously park your car on a precipitously sloping San Francisco hill. It's good for describing abrupt changes too, like a precipitously plunging stock market. It can also be used to mean "carelessly," so your driving teacher may warn, "Don't swerve precipitously when you see a bicycle â€” just slow down."</p></div>`;
