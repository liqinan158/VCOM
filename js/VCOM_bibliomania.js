If you spend all of your paychecks buying first edition novels, you can say you suffer from <i>bibliomania</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>bibliomania</i>, inspired by the French <i>bibliomanie</i>, combines the Greek roots <i>biblio</i>, "book," and <i>mania</i>, "madness" or "frenzy." If you love books as physical objects, and you collect them furiously or compulsively, that's bibliomania. Merely loving to read might instead be called <i>bibliophilia</i>, with <i>philia</i> meaning "fondness" or "love." If your bibliomania interferes with your life, it might even be categorized as a hording disorder.</p></div>`;
