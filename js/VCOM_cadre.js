Examples could be a military unit, a group of scientists, or a band of insurgents.</p><p class="long">Just looking at the "re" at the end of <i>cadre</i> suggests the word has some French roots, and so it does. The word, stemming from the Latin <i>quadrum</i>, meaning "a square," also meant "framework." This idea of a frame or border came to suggest the word as meaning a small group that creates the framework for a larger one, much like a picture frame.  Your cadre of rebels consists of two cats and a stuffed bear . . . at least they'll be good at keeping secrets.</p></div>`;
