If you look at an example, say the Isthmus of Panama, you can see how that neck-like bit of land separates the Caribbean Sea from the North Pacific Ocean as it connects North and South America. Think of an isthmus as kind of like a turkey neck that connects the bird's body and head (at least until Thanksgiving).</p></div></div>`;
