If you remember the old saying “You can’t take it with you!” — then you won't end up acting stingy like a <i>miser</i>.</p><p class="long">The most famous fictional miser is probably Scrooge in Dickens’s <i>A Christmas Carol</i>. The image of his shivering with cold while he counts his coins illustrates the misery often associated with misers.
