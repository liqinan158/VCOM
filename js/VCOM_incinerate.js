Whether it’s an old love letter that makes you sad or a terrible picture of yourself, it might be better just to <i>incinerate</i> it, meaning, you burn it.</p><p class="long">When you burn something beyond recognition, you <i>incinerate</i> it, as its Latin origins in <i>incinerare</i>, or "into ashes" shows. Once you incinerate something, that’s pretty much all that’s left: ashes. The word has a formal feel and is often used to refer to the removal of waste material — your city might incinerate garbage, for example — but you can use it any time you need to reduce something to ashes.</p></div>`;
