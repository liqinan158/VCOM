"I <i>flout</i> the law and the concept of civilian safety by making a concerted effort to jaywalk every time I cross a street."</p><p class="long">Oddly enough, when <i>flout</i> came into existence in the 1550s, it had a much different sense to it than it does now; it's believed that it evolved from the Middle English <i>flowten</i>, “to play the flute." These days, the verb <i>flout</i> means "to scorn," as in to scorn a law, person, or social norm by defying it. As a noun, it is a contemptuous remark or insult. Wrote William Shakespeare, “Flout 'em, and scout 'em; and scout 'em and flout 'em; Thought is free.”</p></div></div>`;
