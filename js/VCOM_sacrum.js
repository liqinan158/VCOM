Many, though not all, animals with a backbone also have a <i>sacrum</i>.</p><p class="long">In humans, the sacrum sits wedged between the two hip bones, connecting the lowest vertebra of the spine with the tailbone or <i>coccyx</i>. A man's sacrum is slightly different from a woman's: it's taller and narrower, with a larger curve. The word comes from the Latin phrase <i>os sacrum</i>, or "sacred bone," and it was named this way because the large sacrum of animals was often a part of ritual sacrifices in ancient times.</p></div>`;
