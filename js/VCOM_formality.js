Even though you knew your request for time off at work would be approved, you still went through the <i>formality</i> of filling out all the required paperwork.</p><p class="long"><i>Formality</i> also means to align with customs or etiquette. In this way, a formality is often something that's more symbolic than necessary. For example, when a big group sits down to eat dinner together, no one starts eating until everyone is served. That formality of dining etiquette is a sign of good manners and consideration for others. If you're British, a formality of your culture is to curtsy or bow when you meet the Queen.</p></div></div>`;
