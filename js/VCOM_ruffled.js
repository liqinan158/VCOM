Your little sister might love her <i>ruffled</i> dress so much that she wants to wear it every day.</p><p class="long">A bird's ruffled feathers provide it some protection as well as looking attractive to potential mates. You can also describe things that are mussed or rumpled, by a hand or the wind, for example, as <i>ruffled</i>. Your dog's ruffled fur might be caused by the breeze â€” or she might have her hackles up because she sees her mortal enemy, the mail carrier. The root of <i>ruffled</i> is probably the Low German <i>ruffelen</i>, "to wrinkle or curl."</p></div></div>`;
