When a child first learns to write, she often starts with the <i>letters</i> in her name. Then she can write a message, or <i>letter</i>, to her grandmother.</p><p class="long">The alphabet begins with the letters <i>a, b, c, d</i>. These are written as capital letters when they appear at the start of a sentence or a proper noun, such as a person's name. Another <i>letter</i> is the kind you write and send to someone through the mail. <i>Letter</i> comes from the Old French <i>letre</i>, "character, letter, or note," from the Latin <i>littera</i>, "letter of the alphabet," and also "a writing or document."</p></div>`;
