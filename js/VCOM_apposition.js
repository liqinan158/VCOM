The <i>apposition</i> of your dog and your cat makes an adorable photograph.</p><p class="long">Though you can use the noun <i>apposition</i> to talk about the positioning of objects — or words — close together, it's usually found in scientific or technical writing. In grammar, an <i>apposition</i> occurs when two words or phrases are placed beside each other in a sentence so that one describes or defines the other. An example is the phrase "my dog Woofers," in which "my dog" is in apposition to the name "Woofers."</p></div>`;
