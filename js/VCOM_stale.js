Ever bite into a piece of bread that's been left out a little too long? Chances are it's <i>stale</i>, or dry and hard to eat. Try making some croutons out of it.</p><p class="long">The word <i>stale</i> comes from the Old French <i>estaler</i> meaning "to halt," which is what happens to your jaw when you try and bite down on a piece of stale bread â€” it just can't chew through it. But <i>stale</i> isn't a word that's used only when talking about food. When an idea is stale, it's old or boring. And when a horse stales, it's not old and crusty, it's urinating. Step aside.</p></div></div>`;
