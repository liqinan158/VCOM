var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">lob</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you <i>lob</i> something, you throw it up very high. If you <i>lob</i> a baseball from the outfield to the pitcher, you hurl it in an arc that ends right where the pitcher can catch it.</p><p class="long">If you propel an object in an arc, you lob it â€” a soldier might lob a missile at the enemy, and a protester might lob a rock at a crowd. Tennis players can lob a ball by hitting it up and over the net. Today the noun <i>lob</i> means a throw (or hit) that follows an arc, but in the 14th century a <i>lob</i> was a "lazy lout," and in the 16th century it was "a lumpish thing."</p></div>`;
