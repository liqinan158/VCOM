You could say, for example, that you'll <i>conceivably</i> still be on time to work after oversleeping, especially if you skip breakfast.</p><p class="long">You might tell your sister that you could conceivably go on every single ride at the state fair in an hour, if you move quickly and don't stop to eat fried dough. You could also say that your favorite baseball team might conceivably win the World Series next year. <i>Conceivably</i> comes from its adjective form, <i>conceivable</i>, and both words are rooted in the Latin <i>concipere</i>, which means "take in, hold, or grasp" and also "become pregnant."</p></div>`;
