Many <i>transepts</i> are found in churches.</p><p class="long">If you can remember that <i>trans</i>, "across" in Latin, sometimes conveys  the idea of "cross," you've nailed this one: it's the cross part in a cross-shaped church, the other section being the "nave." The Latin word <i>saeptum</i> forms the end of <i>transept</i>. It means "fence or enclosure." You're most likely to come across a transept in a Romanesque or Gothic church, although it can also mean a hall or wing that crosses the main part of a building.</p></div>`;
