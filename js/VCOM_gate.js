A garden <i>gate</i> might swing on rusty hinges, when closed helping to keep deer away from your vegetables.</p><p class="long">A pasture gate keeps cattle or horses safe inside a fence, and if you visit someone who lives in a gated community, you'll have to be buzzed in before the gate opens to allow you inside. You'll also find gates at the airport â€” they're the areas with doors leading out to the airplane. The Old English source of <i>gate</i> is <i>geat</i>, "gate, door, opening, or passage."</p></div></div>`;
