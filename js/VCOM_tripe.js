It may sound gross, but your tasty breakfast sausage may include a bit of <i>tripe</i>.</p><p class="long">While tripe isn't commonly found on most restaurant menus, it turns up more often than you might think. Breakfast sausages usually include beef and pork tripe, and international dishes from Korean stews to Mexican tacos to Eritrean stir-fries can all contain tripe. In Old French, <i>tripe</i> meant "guts" or "entrails used as food," and in the 1500s it came to informally mean "worthless person." Today, tripe is also "any nonsense or rubbish," particularly if it's written or spoken.</p></div></div>`;
