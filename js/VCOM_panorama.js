Pay more for your hotel room in Hawaii and you'll likely get a balcony with a picture perfect <i>panorama</i> of the ocean.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>panorama</i> was coined in 1789 by the inventor and artist Robert Barker to describe “a complete view.” These days you can click the panorama setting on your camera to capture an extra wide vista or scene. Don’t confuse <i>panorama</i> with <i>diorama</i>: They sound similar, but remember that a <i>panorama</i> is the view and a <i>diorama</i> is the viewing device.</p></div>`;
