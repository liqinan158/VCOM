If you've got it, you're "wise." If you haven't, well don't worry, most of us don't either.</p><p class="long"><i>Wisdom</i> is also the term we give to the sum total of a culture's knowledge and application of that knowledge, acquired over time. We talk about "the <i>wisdom</i> of the ancient Greeks," for example, meaning everything about their culture from their scientific and philosophical discoveries to the art and culture they created. Don't confuse <i>wisdom</i> with <i>knowledge</i> â€” which is merely the accumulation of facts with no sense of what meaning to make from them.</p></div>`;
