The plot of your favorite book probably involves several complications for the characters, events or situations that make the ending uncertain or create a dilemma. <i>Complication</i> comes from the Latin <i>complicƒÅre</i>, "to fold together," which makes sense since something with many folds is more complicated than something that's flat.</p></div></div>`;
