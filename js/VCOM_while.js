var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">while</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>While</i> describes a length of time. If you were describing a first date, you might say, "We sat there for a <i>while</i> in an incredibly awkward silence."</p><p class="long">Use the word <i>while</i> to talk about an unspecific period of time, like when you ask your friend if you can borrow his notebook for a while. <i>While</i> is also a conjunction that describes things that happen at the same time, like crying while watching a very sad movie. The Old English root of <i>while</i>, <i>hwil</i>, is interesting because the <i>w</i> and the <i>h</i> are switched, but the meaning is the same: a space of time.</p></div>`;
