You might think you need a feather boa, but your sister might say it’s just <i>frippery</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Frippery</i> comes from the French word <i>friperie</i> for "old clothes,” and originally, frippery referred to old, trashy and maybe even tawdry clothes. From there, the word spread to include other kinds of things that aren't worth much. Often, frippery refers to nonsense, or language that is empty and just a lot of hot air. Use this word when you want to say something is showy but ultimately empty of value.</p></div>`;
