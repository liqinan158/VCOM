But the word <i>cesspool</i> isn't just used to describe a storage place underground where sewage is held temporarily. It's also a term you might use to negatively describe something that's swimming in germs or corruption. Stuck on a long flight between two people with a cold? That's a cesspool of germs right there for you.</p></div></div>`;
