If you live by the letter of the <i>law</i>, you follow society's guidelines to a T: you cross at the corner and always wait until the light is green.</p><p class="long">A law is a rule that specifies what you can and can't do. Laws govern communities, countries, and even the world. Your town might have a leash law for dog owners, and international law prohibits throwing garbage off a boat. You can also refer to the police as "the law," as in "Donâ€™t make me call the law." <i>Law</i> also refers to the entire legal system: We are all equal before the law (at least in theory).</p></div>`;
