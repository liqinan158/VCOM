The <i>prevailing</i> opinion in your family might be that your cousin Bob who sleeps in his closet is certifiably insane.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>prevailing</i> comes from the Latin words <i>prae</i>, meaning before, and <i>valere</i>, meaning to be strong or have power. The English word maintains that sense of strength and predominance. If you live a couple of miles north of a pig farm, and the weatherman says that the prevailing winds will be from the south and gusty, it's probably a good day to keep your windows closed.</p></div></div>`;
