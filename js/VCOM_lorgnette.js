You might see a lady with a <i>lorgnette</i> enjoying the opera in an old movie.</p><p class="long">Lorgnettes were originally a type of jewelry, rather than functional eyeglasses. Later, they were used to enhance vision but considered more fashionable than spectacles that hooked over the ears. The disadvantage of a lorgnette is that you have to hold it up to your eyes in order to see clearly. The word comes from the French verb <i>lorgner</i>, "to squint," and <i>lorgne</i>, which means both "squinting" and also "cross-eyed or foolish."</p></div></div>`;
