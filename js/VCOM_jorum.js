You could also call a <i>jorum</i> a punchbowl.</p><p class="long">If you throw a party and fill a bowl with fruit punch, ladling it into cups for your friends, you can call the bowl a <i>jorum</i>, although most of your guests will probably refer to it as a punchbowl.  Not many people still use this eighteenth century word, which may be rooted in a Biblical character, <i>Jorum</i>, who "brought vessels." The Jorum Glacier in Antarctica is named after this word because of the scooped-out bowl shape at its head.</p></div></div>`;
