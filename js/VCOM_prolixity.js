If someone is yammering on and on and on — that's an example of prolixity. Part of <i>prolixity</i> seems good: we'd all like to be able to put words together easily. On the other hand, none of us want to be boring. That's a major downside to prolixity. <i>Prolixity</i> is similar to "wordiness" — using too many words, or too many long words — when a few would get the job done.</p></div></div>`;
