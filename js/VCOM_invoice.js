If you buy books online, they will usually arrive with an <i>invoice</i> telling what books you bought and how much they cost.</p><p class="long"><i>Invoice</i> comes from the French verb <i>envoyer</i>, which means to send, and "send" is a verb often used with the noun <i>invoice</i>, like when the online bookstore sends you an invoice. The same sense occurs when you use <i>invoice</i> as a verb. If you tell someone to invoice you for work they've done, you're asking them to send you a bill.</p></div></div>`;
