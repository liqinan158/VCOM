However, when one sister says to another, "That's so <i>mature</i>,"  she's usually using the word sarcastically, because her sister has done something very <i>immature</i>, like sticking out her tongue.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>mature</i> doesn't only describe advancing age, although the residents of a senior citizens' home could definitely be considered mature. Anything that is fully developed, like an aged cheese or bottle of wine, can also be called <i>mature</i>. The word can also refer to something that is only appropriate for people who are considered legal adults, like the movie that is for "mature audiences only."</p></div></div>`;
