The United States, Canada, and Australia all use the <i>dollar</i>. The symbol for a <i>dollar</i> is $.

There are also coins with the value of a dollar, although these are used less often in the US than in other countries. Sometimes <i>dollar</i> is shorthand for money, like when the Wu-Tang Clan raps, “Cash rules everything around me, dollar dollar bill y’all.” The word <i>dollar</i> comes from the German <i>thaler</i>, an early unit of German currency.</p></div></div>`;
