You could say that your glamorous grandparents make <i>aging</i> look easy.</p><p class="long">The process of getting older, especially as people reach middle age and beyond, is called <i>aging</i>, and it's also an adjective that describes someone or something going through this process. Your aging French teacher might find it harder and harder to read her own writing on the chalkboard, and an aging motorcycle probably needs to be repaired more often. The verb <i>age</i>, or "grow older," is at the heart of <i>aging</i>, and its Latin root is <i>aevum</i>, "lifetime."</p></div></div>`;
