If you want to <i>snub</i> your former best friend, you can refuse to even look at her when you pass in the hallway.</p><p class="long">When you snub someone, you deliver an insult by pretending to not even notice someone that you know. There’s an element of disdain and rejection to a snub, as if you’re too good to even acknowledge the person. As a noun, a <i>snub</i> is that act of cold rejection. Your former friend probably noticed the snub, and she’ll probably snub you from now on. <i>Snub</i> also means "very short," like the nose on a bulldog.</p></div></div>`;
