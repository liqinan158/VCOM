Tool belts have loops for keeping hammers and screwdrivers handy, and a seat belt fastens across your waist and shoulders to keep you safe in a moving car. If you <i>belt</i> someone, it takes on a different meaning: to hit hard. The Latin root is <i>balteus</i>, "girdle or sword belt," and the original definition of the verb was "to hit with a <i>belt</i>."</p></div>`;
