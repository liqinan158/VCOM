Washing hands, coughing into your elbow, and regular house cleaning are all part of good <i>hygiene</i>.</p><p class="long">Hygieia was the Greek goddess of health, cleanliness and sanitation, so it's not hard to see where the word <i>hygiene</i> comes from. Good oral hygiene includes brushing and flossing your teeth, and working in a clean kitchen helps promote food hygiene. You have a better chance of staying healthy during flu season -and any other time- if you practice good personal hygiene, such as washing your hands frequently.</p></div>`;
