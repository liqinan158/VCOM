Your <i>nervousness</i> about flying in an airplane for the first time shouldn't keep you from fulfilling your dream of traveling to Iceland!</p><p class="long">Nervousness takes many forms. What's thrilling to one person —skydiving, public speaking, hosting a party — makes others feel nervous down to their bones. Your dog's nervousness around loud city traffic might finally convince you to move to the country, while your brother might end up outgrowing his nervousness around animals and wind up becoming a vet someday. Nervousness can involve sweating and trembling, or it can be invisible to observers.</p></div></div>`;
