You can also refer to your eardrum as a <i>tympanum</i> â€” or to be really fancy you can call it a <i>tympanic membrane</i>.</p><p class="long">It's more common to use <i>tympanum</i> to talk about an insect's or amphibian's ear rather than to use the word to refer to a human eardrum. In ancient Greece and Rome, a tympanum was a small, hand-held drum, similar to a tambourine. The Greek version of the word was <i>tympanon</i>, from the root <i>typtein</i>, "to beat or strike."</p></div>`;
