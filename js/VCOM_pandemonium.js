This makes sense, since the word <i>pandemonium</i> was coined in Milton’s <i>Paradise Lost</i>, where it was the name of the palace built in the middle of Hell. Milton wrote back in the 17th century. Nowadays, <i>pandemonium</i> crops up whenever journalists are describing a chaotic scene. High school students have been heard to use it to describe their lunchroom.</p></div></div>`;
