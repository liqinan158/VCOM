However, you probably wouldn't call your kids <i>mendicants</i>, even though they beg you for stuff, because the word <i>mendicant</i> also implies extreme poverty.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>mendicant</i> can also refer to a man belonging to a religious order, such as the Franciscan Friars â€” who do not own personal property but live together in a monastery and survive off alms donated by others. As an adjective, <i>mendicant</i> describes someone who lives such an existence.</p></div></div>`;
