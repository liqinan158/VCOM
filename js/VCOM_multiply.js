In other words, when you <i>multiply</i> two by three, you add together three twos.</p><p class="long">When you're doing simple math problems, you can multiply by memorizing lists of times tables â€” or you can add one number as many times as the second number: four times two is the same as two fours, or eight. Another way to multiply is simply to increase or expand greatly: "If the diner starts serving homemade pie, their profits will <i>multiply</i>." The Latin root is <i>multiplicare</i>, "to increase," from <i>multiplex</i>, "having many folds."</p></div>`;
