The involuntary shudder our bodies make in chilly weather is a response meant to raise our body temperature to a safe level. <i>Shiver</i> was originally <i>chiveren</i>, from the Old English <i>ceafl</i>, or "jaw." This is thought to be connected to the chattering your teeth do when you shiver.</p></div>`;
