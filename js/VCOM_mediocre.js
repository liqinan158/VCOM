A "C" is a <i>mediocre</i> grade for students who are fair to middling.</p><p class="long">The roots of the adjective <i>mediocre</i> are from the Latin <i>medial</i>, "middle," and <i>ocris</i>, "mountain." If you think about it, the middle of a mountain is neither up nor down and neither here nor there — just somewhere in between. The definition of <i>mediocre</i> is "of ordinary quality," "merely adequate," and "average." Another word that shares the same root is <i>mediocracy</i>, which means "government run by mediocre people" — an all-too-common condition.</p></div></div>`;
