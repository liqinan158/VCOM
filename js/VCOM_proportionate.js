After all, if you give someone a nose job and their nose turns out too small, it won't look proportionate. And that's just in the visual sense. The old adage "No use crying over spilled milk" is just a way of saying that tears aren't proportionate to such a minor accident. Tears are proportionate when you crash your car, lose your fortune, or don't get into college.</p></div>`;
