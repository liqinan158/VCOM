I <i>sincerely</i> hope you understand what I’m talking about.</p><p class="long"><i>Sincerity</i> means being completely honest about what you mean, and only those who have sincerity should use the related word <i>sincerely</i> to describe their actions. If you <i>sincerely</i> want to swim in a lake, you’re not at all joking, which explains your bathing suit. You can use <i>sincerely</i> at the end of a letter too. “Dear Mom, I <i>sincerely</i> wish you would stop cutting my sandwiches into heart shapes.  <i>Sincerely</i> yours, Kurt.”  No doubt, Kurt sincerely means it.</p></div>`;
