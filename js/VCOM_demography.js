The education levels of everyone on your block? Then you're a fan of <i>demography</i>, the branch of sociology that studies human behavior by analyzing statistical information.</p><p class="long">The word <i>demography</i> comes from two ancient Greek words, <i>demos</i>, meaning "the people," and <i>graphy</i>, meaning "writing about or recording something" â€” so literally <i>demography</i> means "writing about the people." Like many branches of the sciences, demography began in the 19th century, when the general craze for cataloging information about the world really took off (think Darwin.) A common related word is <i>demographics</i>, referring to the raw statistical data that's used for analysis.</p></div></div>`;
