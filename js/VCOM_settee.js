If you don't have enough comfortable places to sit in your apartment, you might consider buying a <i>settee</i>.</p><p class="long">The definition of a settee is essentially the same as a sofa: an upholstered bench with a back and arms. It's more commonly used in Britain than the U.S., and has an old-fashioned sound to it, but you can use this word to describe your loveseat or couch if you like: "Come sit on the settee with me!" Etymologists' best guess about the word's origin is that <i>settee</i> is related to <i>settle</i>, "sit comfortably."</p></div></div>`;
