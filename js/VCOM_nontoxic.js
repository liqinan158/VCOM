It's generally safe to eat or breathe <i>nontoxic</i> substances, and they don't harm the environment.</p><p class="long">It's a good thing if the ingredients in your dish soap are nontoxic â€” it means the suds washing down the drain won't be harmful to the environment, and the residue left on your dishes won't hurt you, either. You can use the adjective <i>nontoxic</i> to distinguish something from its more dangerous, toxic variation. Toxic waste poisons the groundwater or makes nearby animals sick, but nontoxic waste tends to break down without any negative consequences.</p></div>`;
