If you enjoy carriage rides through the park, you'll want to hire a <i>hackney</i>.</p><p class="long">The original Hackney is a British place name, an area that's now part of South London but was once rural land covered with horse pastures. The small horse known as a hackney was named after the location, and so were the carriages-for-hire such horses pulled. As automobiles replaced horses, motorized taxis borrowed the name <i>hackney</i>, or sometimes <i>hackney carriage</i>, both of which are still used today in the U.K.</p></div>`;
