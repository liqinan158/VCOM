That’s because he’s being <i>unrestrained</i>. Anyone exhibiting uncontrolled emotion is <i>unrestrained</i>, meaning they don’t hold back.</p><p class="long"><i>Unrestrained</i> comes from the French <i>restreinte</i>, which means “hold back.” When something is restrained, that thing is confined in some way. <i>Unrestrained</i> means just the opposite. When you’re feeling unrestrained excitement, you might jump up and down, or call all your friends to tell them how you feel. The unrestrained crush you have on the guy in math class might lead you to cover your notebooks with his name written in bubble letters. It happens to the best of us.</p></div>`;
