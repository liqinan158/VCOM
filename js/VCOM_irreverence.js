It's useless to show irreverence towards, say, a stray dog or a friend who's failed their driver's test the second time. Reserve <i>irreverence</i> for situations in which the object of your irreverence would normally inspire reverence. Addressing the president as "Dude" is the height of irreverence.</p></div></div>`;
