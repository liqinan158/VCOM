They organize community activities, social events, and — very important — coffee and donuts on Sunday mornings.</p><p class="long">A parish is technically a piece of land. It’s a section of a diocese that has the right number of churchgoers to have its own church. But when you refer to a parish, you’re usually talking about more than the space itself. You're describing the people who attend the church, as well as the church property. So if someone says, "Our <i>parish</i> is thriving," it means there's a full congregation and enough funds to maintain the church in good condition.</p></div></div>`;
