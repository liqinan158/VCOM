Legumes come from the family Leguminosae, and a trait all legumes share is that they grow in a type of pod. A bowl of pea soup is full of legumes, and so is a bag of peanuts. Lentils, soy, and clover are all legumes. Legumes are high in protein and not very fatty, so they are generally considered healthy.</p></div>`;
