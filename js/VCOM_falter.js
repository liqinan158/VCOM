So if you want to keep your bride or groom happy, it's best not to <i>falter</i> when it's your turn to say "I do."</p><p class="long">Experts may falter if you ask them where <i>falter</i> came from, because the origins are pretty unclear. But everyone agrees on the current meaning: someone who falters is unsteady, wobbly, or unsure. You might falter while reciting a poem if you forget some of the lines, or falter crossing a rickety rope bridge when fear gets the most of you. But you certainly won't falter when someone asks you the meaning of this word.</p></div></div>`;
