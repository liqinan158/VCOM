Many commercial fishermen catch <i>salmon</i>.</p><p class="long">Salmon are born in fresh water, migrate to the ocean, and then return to the place they were born to spawn, or reproduce. Because they move from one place to another, salmon are famous for leaping over dams and against river tides â€” in fact, one theory about the word <i>salmon</i> says its Latin root is <i>salire</i>, or "to leap." There is also a color known as <i>salmon</i>, the pink-orange hue of a salmon's flesh.</p></div></div>`;
