Male <i>lions</i> have thick, golden-colored manes around their necks.</p><p class="long">While the male lion is arguably more striking than the female, it's the females who do nearly all the hunting for a group, or pride, of lions. Tigers are actually larger than lions, making "the king of the beasts" the second-largest wild cat. Because of their strength and power, images of lions are often used as symbols on flags and coats of arms. It's also common to call a strong, courageous person a <i>lion</i>.</p></div></div>`;
