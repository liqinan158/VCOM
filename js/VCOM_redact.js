Don't get too attached to every word in your rough draft; your teacher will expect you to <i>redact</i> it before handing in your final paper.</p><p class="long"><i>Redact</i> refers to any kind revising or editing that makes a document better, usually for publication. When you see the prefix <i>re-</i>, you know the word is going to refer to something either being done again or retracted. You can think of <i>redact</i> as redoing writing or taking back some of what was originally said.  You'll often see the word <i>redact</i> being used with the prepositions  <i>in</i> or <i>into</i>. You might take several documents and redact them into a single one.</p></div>`;
