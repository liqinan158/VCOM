Fasting is an important part of Islam, and its benefits are thought to increase dramatically during Ramadan. Observant Muslims will refrain not only from eating during the day, but also smoking, swearing, and even drinking liquids. The word <i>Ramadan</i> comes from an Arabic word, <i>rama·∏ça</i>, which means "be hot." Originally, Ramadan occurred at the hottest time of the year, but a calendar change resulted in Ramadan's rotation through the seasons.</p></div></div>`;
