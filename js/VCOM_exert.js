For example, when you <i>exert</i> yourself in a workout, you can really feel the burn in your muscles.</p><p class="long">The Latin verb <i>exserere</i> — with its derivative form <i>exsertus</i>, which is the source of our word — means to "put forth." That's where <i>exert</i> gets its meaning of physical force — consider that when you try hard at something, you put forth effort to do it, you push yourself. But <i>exert</i> can refer to other ways you "push": you exert your influence to convince others to think your way; when one nation exerts its power on another; and gravity exerts its force on us, holding us down on earth.</p></div></div>`;
