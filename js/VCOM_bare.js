The adjective <i>bare</i> describes something or someone that is naked or unclothed.</p><p class="long"><i>Bare</i> can be used in many different ways: to describe the inside of your nearly-empty refrigerator, an uncarpeted floor, or your unadorned, sparsely decorated bedroom. The word <i>bare</i> can also be used as a verb meaning "to uncover or expose." When you reveal deep truths about yourself to another person — imagine confessing your passion for stamp collecting to a girl you like — you "<i>bare</i> your soul."</p></div>`;
