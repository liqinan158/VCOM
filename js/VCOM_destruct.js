A developer might buy an old building in order to <i>destruct</i> it and build a shiny new one in its place.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>destruct</i> isn't as common as its relatives, <i>destructive</i>, <i>destruction</i>, and <i>self-destruct</i>, but you can use it to mean "wipe out" or "destroy." Your doctor might worry that your lack of sleep and frequent soda drinking will destruct your health, and a kindergartner will probably wail in frustration if her little brother destructs her Lego creation. <i>Destruct</i> comes from <i>destruction</i>, most likely as 1950's US defense industry jargon.</p></div></div>`;
