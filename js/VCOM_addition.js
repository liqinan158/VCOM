A new room built onto your house, a new item in a store's inventory, even another baseball cap in your collection — all of these are additions. Usually thought of as improvements, you may have heard the phrase "welcome addition" to describe a new cast mate to a television show that has lost its creative spark or a new ball field at your local park.</p></div></div>`;
