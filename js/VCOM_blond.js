We'll leave it to you to decide whether or not <i>blonds</i> have more fun.</p><p class="long">There's all kinds of blonds out there from bleached to platinum to strawberry to sandy. Some people, Brits especially, will add an <i>e</i> to the end of <i>blonde</i> depending on what gender they are talking about, so that a woman is blonde while a man is blond. The addition of the "e" in the feminine form of <i>blonde</i> is of course a holdover from its French origin. Not only fair-haired people are described as blond; you might have seen blond wood used in Scandinavian furniture. Ikea, anyone?</p></div>`;
