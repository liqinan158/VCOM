var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">deadpan</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the word <i>deadpan</i> to describe someone who uses no expression when speaking, such as the <i>deadpan</i> way some comedians deliver even their funniest jokes — which can make them even funnier.</p><p class="long"><i>Deadpan</i> dates to 1928, when <i>pan</i> was slang for "face." So if you seem to have a "dead face" as you say something, it means your face looks very blank — no energy or animation. <i>Deadpan</i> is associated with sarcasm, and like sarcasm, if you use it for comic effect, there's a risk your audience won't pick up on it. Nevertheless, deadpan humor can be funny and popular — witness the success of deadpan humor in the sitcom <i>Seinfeld</i>.</p></div>`;
