People will worry about you if your face looks <i>drawn</i> every morning because you stay up so late doing homework.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>drawn</i> comes from the Old English verb <i>dragan</i>, which means to pull or to drag. <i>Dragan</i> is also the root for the artistic sense of the verb "draw," but <i>drawn</i> doesn't describe art. It can mean pulled closed, however. The drawn drapes keep your room so dark that it's always dark as night in there, which is good for sleeping, but bad when you have to get up early for school.</p></div></div>`;
