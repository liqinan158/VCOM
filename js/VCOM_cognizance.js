Your <i>cognizance</i> of the English language is growing with every new vocabulary word you learn. Just don't flaunt your <i>cognizance</i> too much, or your friends might call you a know-it-all.</p><p class="long"><i>Cognizance</i> can be used to refer to more than just school-based learning (like vocabulary words). It can also mean that you have awareness or notice certain things. Your cognizance of where the exits are located in the movie theater could save your life in a fire. The noun <i>cognizance</i> can also refer to your state of consciousness: "You passed out from the smoke, but when you woke up you had the cognizance to know who you were and where you were."</p></div></div>`;
