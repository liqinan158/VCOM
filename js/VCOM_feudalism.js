In fact, it wasn't until several centuries after this system ended that scholars coined the term <i>feudalism</i>. The ending <i>-ism</i> means "philosophy or system." And <i>feudal</i> comes from the Medieval Latin word <i>feudalis</i>, meaning "feudal estate," and is related to <i>feodary</i>, "one who holds lands of an overlord in exchange for service."</p></div></div>`;
