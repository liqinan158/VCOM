When your company has their annual softball game and potluck picnic, you will probably be asked to <i>contribute</i> a dish, like your famous macaroni salad.</p><p class="long"><i>Contribute</i> comes from a Latin word that means “to bring together, add, or unite.”  When you <i>contribute</i> to a cause, you are adding to what other people have kicked in, which makes the effort complete.  You can <i>contribute</i> your singing talent to a traveling a cappella group; you can <i>contribute</i> money or time to save rhinoceroses; you can <i>contribute</i> cupcakes to the gymnastics team bake sale; or you can even <i>contribute</i> ideas on healthcare reform to a Washington think tank.</p></div>`;
