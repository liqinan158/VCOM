An <i>advert</i> is an advertisement: just shorten <i>advertisement</i>, and you get <i>advert</i>. As a verb, to <i>advert</i> to something means to refer to it.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>advert</i> (AD-vert) shows up mostly in England, where people use it interchangeably with <i>advertisement</i>, as in "Did you see that advert in the paper? If you buy two pairs of socks, you get a third pair free!" The verb <i>advert</i> (ad-VERT), on the other hand, means to "make reference to," like the way your mom might advert to your messy room and unfinished chores when you complain that you're bored.</p></div>`;
