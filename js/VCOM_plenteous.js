If the spaghetti at dinner is <i>plenteous</i>, you won't think twice about having seconds, or even thirds.</p><p class="long">You can use the adjectives <i>plenteous</i> and <i>plentiful</i> interchangeably, although <i>plenteous</i> is the more literary and poetic of the two words. A farmer might say happily, "The corn harvest sure was <i>plenteous</i> this year!" or you could say, "My friends are so <i>plenteous</i>, I'm having trouble choosing just three to invite to my pool party this weekend." <i>Plenteous</i> was originally <i>plentivous</i>, from the Old French <i>plentiveus</i>, "fertile," from <i>plentee</i>, "abundance."</p></div></div>`;
