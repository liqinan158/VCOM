When an actor <i>exits</i>, he moves off the stage and out of sight of the audience.</p><p class="long">You can literally exit a room or a building, or exit in a more figurative way: "She decided to <i>exit</i> politics after two terms as Senator." The door or passage through which you exit can also be called an <i>exit</i>, like the emergency exit on a train or airplane. The stage direction, as in "<i>exit</i>, stage left," is the original English use of the word, from the Latin <i>exitus</i>, "a leaving, a going out."</p></div></div>`;
