If you get bored running on a treadmill daily, you might try something less <i>repetitive</i>, like playing soccer outdoors.</p><p class="long">Anything you do repeatedly, especially when it's boring, can be described using the adjective <i>repetitive</i>. Jobs like loading and unloading a dishwasher, filing papers, and cleaning a bathroom can all feel repetitive when you have to do them regularly. A story your dad tells every time you have guests for dinner is repetitive, and a droning song that repeats the same chorus again and again is repetitive too.</p></div></div>`;
