A police officer, for example, might say that she loves to <i>nab</i> shoplifters.</p><p class="long">You <i>nab</i> when you apprehend a bad guy, or when you suddenly grab something: "Hey, you can't just <i>nab</i> a slice of pizza off my plate!" It's most common to use <i>nab</i> when a criminal is caught, as when the FBI nabs a suspected terrorist or an officer nabs a would-be graffiti artist. <i>Nab</i> probably came from an earlier word, <i>nap</i>, "to seize or catch," which is now obsolete except in the word <i>kidnap</i>.</p></div>`;
