You can see that leap from one line into the next in T. S. Eliot's poem "The Waste Land," where each of the first three lines ends with an enjambment: "April is the cruelest month, breeding / Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing / Memory and desire, stirring / Dull roots with spring rain."</p></div>`;
