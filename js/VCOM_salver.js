If the Queen of England is dropping by for lunch, you might want to set the table with your best <i>salvers</i>!</p><p class="long">While salvers are sometimes made of another metal (or even glass), they're mainly silver trays used in special circumstances. Years ago, servants would serve food using a salver, or collect glasses and carry them away on a salver. If you were a wealthy person sitting at your writing desk, a maid or butler might even have brought your mail on a salver. The word comes from the French <i>salve</i>, "tray for presenting objects to the king."</p></div></div>`;
