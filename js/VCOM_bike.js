A bike enthusiast might keep a bike rack on her car and a bike helmet in her trunk at all times. <i>Bike</i> is also a verb, so you could say: "I'll <i>bike</i> over to the movie theater â€” meet you there in fifteen minutes!" This word, as a nickname for <i>bicycle</i>, first appeared in American English in 1882. It came to mean "motorcycle" about 50 years later.</p></div>`;
