A fun fact: <i>debut</i> and <i>premiere</i> are often thought to be interchangeable, but they’re not. A <i>debut</i>, as you now know, is a first public appearance. But a <i>premiere</i>, while also a “first,” isn't necessarily live. When a movie opens or an interview is broadcast for the first time, they're called <i>premieres</i>.</p></div>`;
