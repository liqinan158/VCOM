Like your spinach soufflé, slime is usually greenish in color, though the clear stuff a snail leaves behind is slime too. If you slime something, you cover it in a slimy substance. Experts believe that <i>slime</i> comes from the Old English <i>lim</i>, "sticky substance," which shares a root with the Russian <i>slimak</i>, or "snail."</p></div>`;
