When you clap your <i>hands</i>, you loudly smack their palms together to express your appreciation and enthusiasm.</p><p class="long">Human hands have 27 bones, as well as extremely dextrous thumbs that make it possible for us to do things that very few animals can do. Your hands enable you to pick up small things, hold a baby, pet a cat, speak in American Sign Language, chop vegetables for a salad, and many other things. When you clap, you give someone a <i>hand</i>, or applaud them â€” and another way to lend a <i>hand</i> is to help someone out.</p></div>`;
