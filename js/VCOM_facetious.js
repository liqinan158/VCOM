Anything <i>facetious</i> is a joke. If you've just won a hotdog-eating contest and someone asks if you'd like to go out for burgers, they’re probably being <i>facetious</i>.</p><p class="long">If you forget how to spell <i>facetious</i>, notice that it has all five vowels in a row. The word <i>facetious</i> comes from the French <i>facétie</i>, “joke,” and it has come to describe a joke with a little drop of sarcasm. It used to simply mean “funny and witty,” but now it often implies that someone is being inappropriately funny about a serious topic.</p></div></div>`;
