var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">amiss</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When things are out of their proper places or not happening the way they should, we say they are <i>amiss</i>. Sherlock Holmes, like many sharp detectives, would quickly notice when something was <i>amiss</i> at a crime scene.</p><p class="long">The word <i>amiss</i> can be used as an adverb, as in the sentence, "I spoke amiss." Or you could use it as an adjective, as when you think something is wrong or missing â€” "Something in the room is amiss." Either way, <i>amiss</i> refers to something that is wrong, off the mark, or "missed." Once in a while, the word <i>amiss</i> can imply that something fishy or foul has taken place. In <i>Hamlet</i>, when Marcellus said, "Something is rotten in the state of Denmark," he might as well have said, "Something in Denmark is amiss."</p></div>`;
