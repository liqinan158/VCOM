Your friend might ask you to meet her in the <i>courtyard</i> of her apartment complex.</p><p class="long">In cities, courtyards provide small, private outdoor areas. Courtyards are often nestled between buildings, or tucked away behind them. For nearly as long as people have built houses and buildings, courtyards have existed â€” although in the past, they were used for keeping animals, cooking over an open fire, and sometimes even sleeping. The word dates from the 1550s, combining <i>court</i>, from the Latin <i>cohors</i>, "enclosed yard," and <i>yard</i>, from a Germanic root also meaning "enclosure."</p></div>`;
