It is the opposite of <i>spiritual</i> or <i>emotional</i>. Something that is corporeal exists in the real world. It’s sort of a fancy way of saying <i>bodily</i> or <i>physical</i>. So when you crave double-cheese pizza with sausage and pepperoni, you could blame it on a corporeal need. (It’s a way to make junk-food cravings sound a little bit grand!)</p></div></div>`;
