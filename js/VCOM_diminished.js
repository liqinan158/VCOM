When something is <i>diminished</i>, it’s been weakened or lessened.</p><p class="long"><i>Diminished</i> is an adjective used when something has lost its power, prestige, or worth. The value of a car, for instance, is diminished over time by wear and tear. In some instances, <i>diminished</i> means "belittled," or made to seem like less in the face of something perceived as better or greater. The popularity of a laptop, for instance, will be diminished if a cheaper, more powerful model is released.  Leaders and politicians who get involved in scandals often suffer diminished reputations.</p></div></div>`;
