People also use the word <i>gateway</i> to describe the entryway into anything, like school could be your <i>gateway</i> to opportunity. Study hard.</p><p class="long">Gateways are similar to doorways, with the obvious difference being the gate that you open to pass through, rather than a door. You can also use this word in a figurative way, to mean "entrance," or "means of access." For example, you could say, "That huge bank building is the <i>gateway</i> to the city's financial district," or "Delhi is the <i>gateway</i> to South Asia."</p></div></div>`;
