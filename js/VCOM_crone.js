You might call her a <i>crone</i>, if you’re brave. (But be careful: the term is insulting.)</p><p class="long">Since the late fourteenth century the word <i>crone</i> has been a term of abuse describing old and bad-tempered women. It traces back to the Anglo-French word <i>charoine</i>, meaning “dead flesh.” Most people don’t like being described as dead flesh, and if the person happens to have a bad temper also . . . well, you can see that it’s not a term you want to toss around lightly. You’re more likely to hear it used in a Shakespeare play than in real life.</p></div></div>`;
