If you break it down to the first part, take <i>vox</i>, meaning "voice" and add it to <i>ferre</i>, meaning "to carry," then <i>vociferous</i> describes voices that carry; you can hear a vociferous person from across the room at a dance party. Vociferous isn't just loud, but annoying, too, like when the vociferous fans of the opposing team chant insults in unison. Try yanking a cookie out of a little kid's hand if you want to hear a vociferous reaction.</p></div></div>`;
