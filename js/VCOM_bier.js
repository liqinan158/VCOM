When a popular public figure dies, crowds of mourners may line up in order to walk past the <i>bier</i> and pay their respects.</p><p class="long">You might confuse this word with <i>beer</i>, its homonym — but you can't drink a bier.  The word comes from the Old English <i>bær</i>, "handbarrow or litter," and its root meaning, "to carry." Some biers are stationary frames, while others can be lifted and carried by pallbearers as they transport a coffin. It's a sad occasion that requires a bier.</p></div></div>`;
