A birder may catch sight of a hummingbird, only to have it disappear a <i>split second</i> later.</p><p class="long">You can also call a <i>split second</i> a <i>heartbeat</i> or a <i>flash</i>. This term emphasizes how brief something is: "I only paused a <i>split second</i> before volunteering for the spelling bee." It can also be an adjective, as in "<i>split second</i> timing" or a "<i>split second</i> decision." The original <i>split second</i> was a type of stopwatch with two second hands, so that a fraction of a second could be timed.</p></div></div>`;
