A reporter might use a <i>recorder</i> during an interview. A <i>recorder</i> is also often a first musical instrument for kids, who crank out “Hot Cross Buns” at top volume.</p><p class="long">A digital recorder and the recorder on your cell phone are both examples of electronic recorders. A person whose job involves taking notes or keeping written records during a meeting can also be called a recorder. A now-obsolete meaning of the verb <i>record</i> is "practice a tune," and from this came the 15th century name of the musical instrument called a recorder. These wind instruments are still around, not just in elementary schools.</p></div>`;
