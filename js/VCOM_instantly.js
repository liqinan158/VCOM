Your parents might say they fell in love instantly, the moment they first saw each other, and you may realize instantly on the first day of school that you are going to love your history class. The adverb <i>instantly</i> first meant "persistently," rather than "immediately," though it soon gained this meaning. The Medieval Latin root is <i>instantem</i>, "pressing, urgent," or "standing near."</p></div>`;
