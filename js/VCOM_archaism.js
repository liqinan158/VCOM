Forsooth, you'll encounter many <i>archaisms</i> when you read Shakespeare â€” or when you go to the local Renaissance Faire.</p><p class="long">There's a difference between an archaism and a word that's obsolete, or so out of date that no one uses it. Archaisms aren't dead, they're just archaic, a bit outmoded and best suited to literary or philosophical writing. Shakespeare's plays are full of archaisms, and so are most editions of the Bible. If you prefer to call your friends <i>thou</i> and <i>thee</i> instead of <i>you</i>, you're a fan of archaisms.</p></div>`;
