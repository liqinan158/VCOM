You're going to feel slightly <i>woozy</i> after you get your wisdom teeth removed, so be sure to have someone drive you home and look after you.</p><p class="long"><i>Woozy</i> was first recorded in the 1890s as being student slang, used to mean "foolish or behind the times" and occasionally (and confusingly) "delightful." Soon after this, the current meaning of "muddled or dazed" appeared in informal North American speech. Feel free to use it for anyone who's lightheaded or dazed: "She felt woozy on the beach from all that sun."</p></div>`;
