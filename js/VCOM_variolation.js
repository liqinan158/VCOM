The process of <i>variolation</i> involved infecting a healthy person with tissue or fluid of a person with smallpox.</p><p class="long">Variolation required the healthy patient to have tissue from a person with active smallpox (or who had recovered from smallpox) inserted into scratches on the skin. When variolation was "successful," the patient had a very mild case of smallpox, a disease which was often deadly. Ultimately, this method was found to be ineffective, and it was replaced in the late 1700s by the smallpox vaccine. <i>Variolation</i> comes from <i>variola</i>, "smallpox," and the Latin <i>varius</i>, "changing" or "spotted."</p></div></div>`;
