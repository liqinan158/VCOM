var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">retaliate</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>retaliate</i> means to get back at someone, usually through a counterattack. “Ned got hit with a cream pie, then he <i>retaliated</i> by throwing a bucket of Jell-O at his attackers.”</p><p class="long">When you see the prefix <i>re</i> in a word, it usually means back. To <i>return</i>, <i>remember</i>, <i>regurgitate</i> (yuck) — all of these verbs relate to doing something back. At the beginning of <i>retaliate</i> it means back, and the <i>taliate</i> means to pay, so what you’re talking about here is payback. If you’re doing something terrible to someone just because you want to, that’s doesn’t mean to <i>retaliate</i>. But, if you feel they’ve done something bad to you, and you’re just getting them back? That’s when you <i>retaliate</i>.</p></div>`;
