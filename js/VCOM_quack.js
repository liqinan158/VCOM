A good <i>quack</i> is the sound a duck makes. A bad <i>quack</i> is someone pretending to be a doctor. (You'd be better off visiting the duck with your ailment.)</p><p class="long">If you ever get a chance to interview a celebrity duck, prepare to write the word <i>quack</i> in your notebook many, many times, because that’s all that ducks can say. The way you spell animal sounds changes depending what language you speak. In English a duck quacks, but in Danish a duck "raps," while Indonesian ducks "wek," and Romanian ducks say "mac." And that "MD" who isn’t really a doctor, but is good at pretending to be one? He's a quack. If you ever meet a quack that "quacks," please run.</p></div></div>`;
