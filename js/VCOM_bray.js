The sound itself is known also as a <i>bray</i>.</p><p class="long">A mule or donkey's bray is loud and jarring when compared to the gentle neigh of a pony. If you have a loud, goofy laugh, your friends might describe it as a bray, too. Donkeys bray when they're under stress, and they bray back and forth to each other from separate stalls in a barn.  When you argue loudly with your brother, your dad may yell, "I'm tired of hearing you two bray!" The Old French root of <i>bray</i> is <i>braire</i>, "to cry out."</p></div>`;
