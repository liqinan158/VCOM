If you don't like conformity, then you're <i>individualistic</i> too.</p><p class="long">Many people believe that our society tries to make us all the same â€” to like the same food and wear the same clothes. Folks who reject that idea are individualistic. They believe that the most radical thing you can do is be yourself, however different that self may happen to be. The U.S. was known as country of individualists for many years. It's where individualistic people came to invent themselves however they liked. Some say, though, that recently it's grown less individualistic, as people are more afraid to seem different or unique.</p></div>`;
