Your <i>skin-deep</i> commitment to saving the environment isn't terribly serious.</p><p class="long">You may have heard the saying "beauty is only <i>skin-deep</i>," which means that while someone may be beautiful on the outside, their character—what's inside, and more meaningful—isn't necessarily attractive. The first attested use of <i>skin-deep</i> was in "A Wife," a 1613 poem by Sir Thomas Overbury: "All the carnall beauty of my wife, Is but <i>skin-deep</i>." Its publication infamously resulted in Overbury's murder when its subject deduced that it was about her.</p></div>`;
