"Because he was the brother of the CEO, he was offered a <i>sinecure</i> in the company: he showed up each day and collected a paycheck, but others actually did his work."</p><p class="long">The noun <i>sinecure</i> comes from the Latin root words <i>sine cura</i> meaning "without care." It originally was used to describe a church position that did not include caring for the souls of parishioners, but that meaning is considered archaic now. The word is now usually associated with political appointments.</p></div></div>`;
