var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">overrun</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Overrun</i> means being populated in huge numbers or occupied in some way. Your beautiful beach town may be peaceful in the winter but <i>overrun</i> by tourists every summer.</p><p class="long">You can use this verb for a successful invading army: "The troops managed to overrun the entire peninsula, reclaiming the land they'd lost." It's also good for other kinds of invasions and infestations: "They closed my dog's daycare because it was overrun by fleas." The earliest meaning, still used today, was "continue beyond a specified time," like the class that overruns by fifteen minutes, making you very late to third-period math.</p></div>`;
