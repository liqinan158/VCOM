You can also use it to describe a huge amount of work, like the <i>monolith</i> that is your 40-page term paper.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>monolith</i> comes from the Greek words <i>monos</i>, meaning “single” and <i>lithos</i>, meaning “stone.” Any large structures, like a factory that could cover many football fields in size, can be called a monolith. So can monuments that have little definition, like Stonehenge. Even companies that seem to be everywhere, their products and neon-signed restaurants covering the globe, can be called monoliths.</p></div></div>`;
