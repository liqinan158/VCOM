You could say, "My parents are <i>loony</i> — they call me three times a day and are always sending me photos of their little dog dressed in doll clothes," or talk about the loony story you read for your book group. <i>Loony</i> is an American-coined word, short for <i>lunatic</i> and also referencing the cry of the bird called a <i>loon</i>.</p></div>`;
