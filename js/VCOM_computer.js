Tech geeks dreamed up <i>computer</i> by embellishing the English word <i>compute</i>, which means "to calculate." <i>Compute</i>, in turn, comes from Latin <i>com-</i>, "with" and <i>putare</i>, "to reckon." So, your computer is a device that helps you reckon â€” or think. It also comes in handy for email and every type of entertainment imaginable.</p></div>`;
