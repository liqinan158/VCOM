Ever since humans started creating art, they've been using <i>umber</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Pigments</i> are the shades of color that painters and other artists use, and when they occur naturally, they're called <i>earth pigments</i>. Umber falls into this category â€” its rich, deep brown shade comes directly from minerals (raw umber) or from minerals heated to a darker shade (burnt umber). Today, oil painters still use umber when they need a fast-drying brown pigment. Umber gets its name from a region in Italy where it's common, <i>Umbria</i>.</p></div>`;
