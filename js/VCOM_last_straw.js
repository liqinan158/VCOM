It's annoying that your brother keeps borrowing your clothes, but spilling ketchup on your favorite sweater is the <i>last straw</i>.</p><p class="long">The phrase <i>last straw</i> often shows up in an angry declaration: "I have had it with people dressing my cat in clothes! This little tuxedo is the last straw!" It comes from a longer saying, "the last straw that breaks the camel's back." Experts aren't positive about the phrase's origins, but they suspect a connection to an older saying, "it is the last feather that breaks the horse's back."</p></div></div>`;
