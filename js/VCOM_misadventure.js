That’s the start of a <i>misadventure</i>, an unfortunate situation that happens because of bad luck.</p><p class="long">Kids are always having misadventures. Falling into a pit of mud, getting stuck between slats in a fence, a monkey stealing the shirt off your back: all classic misadventures. The word is rooted in the French word <i>mesaventure</i>, which translates to “turn out badly.” Some misadventures are only embarrassing, while others are exhausting and sad. The worst part? You can’t prevent a misadventure, because they happen by chance.</p></div></div>`;
