Either of these actions may be necessary when someone isn't behaving like they're supposed to.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>chasten</i> is often used with the verb "to be" as in "be chastened." If students are caught writing graffiti on the bathroom wall, you can expect them to be chastened by both the school and their parents. <i>Chasten</i> is related to the word <i>chastise</i>, meaning "to punish severely." Both words can be traced back to the Latin root <i>castus</i>, meaning "morally pure." So keep yourself on the straight and narrow when it comes to morality and you can avoid being chastened.</p></div></div>`;
