var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">noxious</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Something <i>noxious</i> is harmful and could be even fatal â€” whether it is colorless, odorless, and invisible like carbon monoxide, or dark, strong-smelling, and obvious, like black smoke from a fire. People are called noxious too when they hurt others with cruelty or mental anguish.</p><p class="long">English and Latin roots for <i>noxious</i> are related to the meanings of "harm," "damage," and "injury." While <i>obnoxious</i> might come to mind when seeing the word <i>noxious,</i> <i>obnoxious</i> is a much less damaging adjective to describe someone annoying. Most uses for <i>noxious</i> involve real physical or emotional damage unless the word is used in exaggeration. Examples range from "the <i>noxious</i> gas fumes made the dog pass out" to "his cologne was so <i>noxious</i> I had to exit the elevator and take the stairs."</p></div>`;
