When a song is a little high for you, you can transpose it to bring it down into your natural range. In math, to <i>transpose</i> is to move something from one side of an equation to another. In the equation x + 3 = 2y, you can solve for x by transposing the 3 to the other side of the equation, which will change its sign and give you x = 2y - 3.</p></div>`;
