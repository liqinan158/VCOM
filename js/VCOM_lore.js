It's the <i>lore</i> in "folklore," and responsible for spreading the word on mythical figures like Santa Claus, Paul Bunyan, and even Uncle Sam.</p><p class="long">Most lore begins as an oral tradition, passed on by word of mouth, and only later takes on a written form. We tend to think of lore as something centuries-old, as in the British Arthurian lore surrounding the doings of the mythical King Arthur and his court. However, newer lore — such as baseball lore —  is constantly springing up. Humans need and love their lore.</p></div>`;
