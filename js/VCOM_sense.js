You can use <i>sense</i> to describe something perceived with your senses, like when you sense your dog is near because of the smell. <i>Sense</i> also refers to the unconscious process of figuring something out, like when you sense that someone is cheating at cards. If you have common sense you don't do foolish things. The sense of a word is how it's used.</p></div>`;
