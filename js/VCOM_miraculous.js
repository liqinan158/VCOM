In any event, as the word suggests, it has the character of a miracle.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>miraculous</i> has origins in the Latin word <i>miraculum,</i> meaning "object of wonder."  It's often used to describe religious happenings, such as a direct answer to one's prayer. In a more secular context, a "miraculous comeback" is when a football team that's down by 30 points at halftime ends up winning the Super Bowl.</p></div>`;
