People say that <i>zealotry</i> springs not out of faith but doubt. Makes sense.</p><p class="long"><i>Zealotry</i> is believing so strongly in something that you are completely intolerant of different beliefs or opinions. A government's zealotry might lead it to outlaw free speech and arrest journalists. <i>Zealotry</i> comes from the noun <i>zealot</i>, or "fanatic," which is rooted in the Greek <i>zelotes</i>, "a zealous follower," ultimately from the Greek <i>zelos</i>, "zeal, ardor, or jealousy."</p></div></div>`;
