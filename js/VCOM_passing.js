A passing reference is a light, brief mention of something, and a passing grade is one that's high enough for you to pass a test. As a noun, <i>passing</i> often means "the end of something," like the passing of an era â€” while the passing of a person means death. When you talk about something "in <i>passing</i>," you mention it in a casual way.</p></div></div>`;
