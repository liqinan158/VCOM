The word suggests a peaceful, pleasant feeling, as though you were far away from the noise of modern life.</p><p class="long">As a noun, <i>sylvan</i> means a being that inhabits the woods. The Roman god of woods and fields was known as <i>Silvanus</i>, sometimes also known as the half-man, half-goat <i>sylvan</i> called Pan. Shakespeareâ€™s character Puck, in "A Midsummer Night's Dream," seems based on a sylvan, and other authors used the image as well. The adjectival use of the Middle French word <i>sylvain</i> evolved in the mid-16th century. The word is most often used today to describe an idyllic wooded area.</p></div></div>`;
