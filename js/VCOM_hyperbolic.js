The Greek root <i>huperbolē</i> means “excess,” and broken down even further the word literally translates as “throw above.”  Imagine tossing a football to a friend, but you throw it way above their head and onto a roof.  That’s an excess of throwing, and it’s not necessary, which is exactly what being hyperbolic is all about: making statements bigger than necessary.</p></div>`;
