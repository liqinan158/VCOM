A <i>patron</i> of a business supports the business by being a loyal customer. A <i>patron</i> of the arts helps support starving artists â€” financially, not with food rations.</p><p class="long">The word <i>patron</i> comes from the Latin <i>pater</i> or <i>patr-</i> meaning "father." Think of how a father is supposed to financially support his kids. A patron of the arts is someone who shows his appreciation or support for the arts by donating money to arts organizations. And a patron of the Red Lobster is a frequent customer who can be seen in the same corner booth every Sunday night, noshing on cheddar biscuits.</p></div>`;
