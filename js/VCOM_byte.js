Many computer operations involve a certain amount of <i>bytes</i> working per second or per minute. The word <i>byte</i> is related to another computer term, a <i>bit</i>, which is an even smaller piece of information; eight bits form one byte. The related words <i>megabyte</i> and <i>gigabyte</i> both have a whole lot of bytes â€” and even more bits.</p></div></div>`;
