You like to joke that the city buses follow a <i>stochastic</i> schedule because they arrive at random times at the various bus stops.</p><p class="long"><i>Stochastic</i> is from the Greek word <i>stokhastikos</i>, meaning able to guess, with the root <i>stokhos</i> meaning a target––in Greek <i>stokhos</i> literally means a stick meant for archers to shoot at. The "guess" part of the original Greek work is still part of the word's meaning today: A stochastic process in a computer program, for example, is one where you can't predict what is going to happen in the program because of something random in it.</p></div></div>`;
