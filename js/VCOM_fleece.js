A person's coat can be called a fleece, too, if it comes from a sheep or goat or a yak or even if it just looks like it did.</p><p class="long">You can also use <i>fleece</i> in an informal way to mean cheating someone.  Remember how Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow?  Well, it was such a nice, clean fleece that Mary tricked the lamb into trusting her, then robbed him of his fleece and turned it into a bomber jacket and a pair of boots. She totally fleeced him!</p></div>`;
