Unfortunately your impassioned <i>philippic</i> condemning your parents’ midnight curfew rule only resulted in you being grounded for a week.</p><p class="long">The word <i>philippic</i> originates from the Greek word <i>philippikos</i>, the name given to the speeches of the famous Greek orator Demosthenes, who warned the Athenians against Philip II of Macedon. The Greeks didn’t listen to Demosthenes, however, and then Philip and his son Alexander the Great ended up bringing all of Greece under Macedonian control. Too bad for the Athenians!</p></div>`;
