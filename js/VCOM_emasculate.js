Some people believe that having a tough female boss can <i>emasculate</i> male employees.</p><p class="long">The Latin <i>emasculatus</i> literally means "to castrate," though it is usually used figuratively, the same way <i>emasculate</i> is sometimes used to suggest a man isn't very manly. You may have seen bullies hassle a guy, saying he can't beat up anyone, or hit a curveball, or. . .you get the idea. Such emasculating is also insulting to women because it suggests <i>strength</i> and <i>female</i> are opposites.</p></div></div>`;
