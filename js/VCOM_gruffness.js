Your uncle's <i>gruffness</i> might cause most of your cousins to be scared of him.</p><p class="long">Someone who's known for her gruffness isn't necessarily mean, but she's so direct and matter-of-fact that she can come across that way. Gruffness isn't a great quality in a kindergarten teacher, but gruffness can come in handy when you work as a military officer or a dog trainer. <i>Gruffness</i> comes from the adjective <i>gruff</i>, which means "short or surly," but originally meant "coarse grained," from the Middle Low German word <i>grof</i>, "coarse, thick, or large."</p></div>`;
