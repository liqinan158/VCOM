Constantly mentioning how much you love dogs is a way of <i>obliquely</i> telling your parents that you want a pet.</p><p class="long">The word <i>obliquely</i> can mean the indirect way something is talked about or the indirect path that something takes. It's also a word used to describe when something is positioned sideways or on a slant, like a ladder propped obliquely against the wall. Ever notice how the rain seems to fall on a slant against a lamp light at night? It's not falling straight, but obliquely or on an angle.</p></div>`;
