When you share a pizza with your best friend, you can cut it in half, or <i>halve</i> it.</p><p class="long">A recipe might instruct you to halve an onion, and a little kid might request that you halve her peanut butter sandwich and cut the crusts off. You can also halve less physical things â€” you can halve your expenses if you reduce them by half, or halve the bill for lunch with your sister, if you split it with her. <i>Halve</i> comes from <i>half</i>, originally an Old English word meaning "side" or "part."</p></div>`;
