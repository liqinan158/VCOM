In a sense, a city's suburbs can also be thought of as its <i>purlieus</i>. This word usually shows up in its plural form, as in "the <i>purlieus</i> of the palace."</p><p class="long">You can use the noun <i>purlieu</i> for any outlying or nearby areas, or even to mean "usual haunts," like the used record shops and cafes where you and your friends normally hang out. Originally, a <i>purlieu</i> was a term used in Britain's now-obsolete forest law for land adjacent to a forest. It probably comes from the Anglo-French <i>puralee</i>, "a going round to settle the boundaries."</p></div></div>`;
