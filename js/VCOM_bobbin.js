The machine makes a stitch by catching the bottom thread, from the <i>bobbin</i>, with the top thread, from the needle.</p><p class="long">Most bobbins are wound with thread and inserted in sewing machines, but the word describes many spools and cylinders that hold string, yarn, wire, or other materials. Some machines contain bobbins, wound with wire or tape, and a weaver or knitter often works with a yarn bobbin close at hand. <i>Bobbin</i> comes from the French <i>bobine</i>, "small instrument used in sewing," which shares a Latin root with <i>babble</i>, for the sound it makes while unspooling.</p></div></div>`;
