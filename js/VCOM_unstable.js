If you are <i>unstable</i> emotionally, you might be ecstatically happy one minute and horribly depressed and angry the next.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>unstable</i> means the opposite of <i>stable</i>. <i>Stable</i> is derived from the Latin base word <i>stare</i> meaning “to stand.” If a building, family, person, bridge, or chemical solution is stable it will “stand still,” even if something unexpected happens. On the other hand, if a person or thing is unstable and stress is applied, he, she, or it is likely to shift position, possibly in a dangerous way.</p></div></div>`;
