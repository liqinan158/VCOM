If the big football game on Sunday ends with a fight among fans of the opposing teams, commentators will say that the game was <i>marred</i> by violence.</p><p class="long">The word <i>marred</i> can be traced back to the Old English word <i>merran</i>, meaning “to waste or spoil.” <i>Marred</i> often carries with it the sense of spoiling perfection. It can be a flaw that makes something outstanding less than perfect, such as a movie star’s face marred by a scar or a career marred by controversy.</p></div>`;
