You can also call other kinds of blockages <i>logjams</i> â€” like a traffic <i>logjam</i> that develops due to rubbernecking drivers trying to check out a crash.</p><p class="long">Logjams change the way water flows in a river, sometimes creating new channels and pools from the overflow of water. This can be good for spawning fish, but sometimes a logjam causes flooding and other problems. This has given rise to the figurative <i>logjam</i>, a problem that stops or blocks progress: "The disagreement caused a <i>logjam</i> in Congress until the President stepped in."</p></div></div>`;
