A <i>natty</i> dresser is someone who is very stylish and has a snappy attitude. He may even be wearing a <i>natty</i> fedora.</p><p class="long"><i>Natty</i> is an adjective that comes from the 18th century. Originally it was a slang term, perhaps related to the adjective <i>neat</i>. These days, if you say someone “looks neat,” it might sound like they look clean, but it also can mean that they look fashionable and put together. That’s what <i>natty</i> means, too. Someone who is natty is wearing fashionable clothes and is generally hip.</p></div></div>`;
