When someone becomes incapacitated, illness or injury is usually to blame. This adjective is often used in the same manner as <i>disabled</i>. <i>Incapacitated</i> can also mean "ineligible." For instance, if you are too old to join the army, then your age makes you incapacitated from serving in the army.</p></div></div>`;
