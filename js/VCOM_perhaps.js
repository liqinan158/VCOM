It's another way of saying "I don't know" or "It's possible. Who knows?" People use <i>perhaps</i> when talking about things they aren't sure about, or things they don't want to answer in a decisive way. When a friend says, "Perhaps we'll go to that movie," don't count on it. He's keeping his options open.</p></div></div>`;
