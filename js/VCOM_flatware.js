When you set the table with spoons, forks, and knives, you grab the <i>flatware</i> from the drawer.</p><p class="long">You can also call flatware <i>silverware</i> or <i>cutlery.</i> Sometimes the word means everything you'd use to set the table, including dishes and plates, which is actually its original definition, dating from around 1850. Back then, you might refer to your plates as flatware and call your glasses <i>hollow ware.</i> Today, if your grandpa asks you to bring the flatware to the table, he probably means forks and spoons.</p></div></div>`;
