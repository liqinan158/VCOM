If you tell an <i>empathetic</i> person that your heart is broken, she might touch her own heart and gaze at you sadly through moist eyes.</p><p class="long"><i>Empathetic</i> is a recent term; it comes from <i>empathy</i>, which was coined by the German philosopher Rudolf Lotze in 1858.  Lotze believed that when you look at a work of art, you project your own sensibilities onto it.  So if you feel sad when you see a painting of a woman weeping over a dying lover, that's because you can imagine what it's like to lose someone you love.  To make the word, Lotze turned to the ancient Greek <i>empatheia</i>, which means "passion."</p></div>`;
