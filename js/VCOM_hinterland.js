Use it to specify an area that is far away from a city or town, or even civilization as we know it.  Cell-phone reception and cable television aren't guaranteed.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>hinterland</i> comes to the English language via Germany:  <i>hinter</i> is "behind" + <i>land</i> is, well, "land." It actually refers to the land lying inland — or behind — an ocean coast or river shore, which is why <i>backwaters</i>  and <i>hinterlands</i> are used interchangeably. Use <i>hinterlands</i> when you want to make fun of an area's backwardness, or to celebrate its natural beauty: "Coming from the unspoiled <i>hinterlands</i> of Louisiana, she found it hard to adjust to the sights and sounds of the big city."</p></div></div>`;
