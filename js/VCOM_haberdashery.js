In the UK, the meaning is different â€” a British haberdashery sells sewing notions like buttons, zippers, and thread. The word comes from <i>haberdasher</i>, "seller of small things." These small things sometimes traditionally included men's hats, which led to the American definition of "men's shop."</p></div></div>`;
