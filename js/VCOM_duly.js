var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">duly</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you put in a lot of overtime hours at your job, you assume you'll be <i>duly</i> paid. <i>Duly</i> means "properly" or "appropriately."</p><p class="long">When something is done duly, it's expected, and it's considered proper or right. If someone gives a great speech, you expect that he'll be duly applauded for it. The word <i>due</i> is at the root of <i>duly</i>, and it comes from the Old French word <i>deu</i>, or "to owe." Something that is duly given can also be said to be owed. Be careful not to confuse <i>duly</i>, which rhymes with the name "Julie," with <i>dully</i>, "without liveliness."</p></div>`;
