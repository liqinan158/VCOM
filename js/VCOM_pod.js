When you buy fresh peas from the farmer's market, they come still in their <i>pod</i>.</p><p class="long">In many plants, seeds grow in groups, nestled within a pod. Peas are one such plant, and many other legumes and flowers have seed pods as well. The expression "two peas in a <i>pod</i>" refers to the way seeds are clustered together within the pod, and means "very similar to each other." <i>Pod</i> comes from the fifteenth century term <i>podware</i>, "seed of legumes or grain."</p></div>`;
