There are various ailments that can be defined as <i>reflux</i>, including indigestion and heartburn, as well as conditions that affect babies who have trouble swallowing. Another kind of <i>reflux</i> is the tide's ebb, or outward flow. This is the oldest meaning of the word, which comes from the Latin <i>fluxus</i>, "a flowing."</p></div></div>`;
