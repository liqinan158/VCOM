var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">mossy</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Anything covered with or resembling moss is <i>mossy</i>. A <i>mossy</i> rock can be pretty. <i>Mossy</i> teeth are never pretty.</p><p class="long">Moss tends to grow in a green carpet, especially in wooded or shady areas, so when you're walking through a forest you'll probably come upon mossy areas. Informally, you can also use this adjective to mean "old fashioned" or "dated." Your grandparents' conservative ideas about dating, for example, might be a little mossy. The word stems from an Old English root, <i>meos</i>, that's a close relation to <i>mos</i>, or "bog."</p></div>`;
