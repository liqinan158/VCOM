As an adjective, <i>ideal</i> describes this ultimate standard for excellence, or something that exists only as an idea.</p><p class="long">When we talk about what's ideal, we often refer to a best-case scenario (it would be ideal if you were well-rested before your exam); what we're striving for (it would be ideal for all children to receive an education); or some idea of perfection (the ideal date would be dinner with your favorite movie star). If you have high ideals, you have very strong beliefs about what is good and right, and maybe even how best to save the world.</p></div></div>`;
