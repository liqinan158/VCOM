It is <i>thoughtful</i> to cook your friend's favorite dish when you invite him over for dinner.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>thoughtful</i> describes someone who pays attention or considers others' feelings when they speak and act. If your friend is heartbroken about a recent break-up, holding off on gushing about your new love is the thoughtful thing to do. <i>Thoughtful</i> can also describe intellectual depth, like a thoughtful essay on a well-known poem that focuses on a line that other scholars have overlooked.</p></div>`;
