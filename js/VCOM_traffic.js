Pedestrians also create traffic, like those walking past your new burrito palace and pet costume shop. While your business may be perfectly respectable, you would want to watch out for people who traffic stolen goods and illegal drugs. In that sense, <i>traffic</i> acts as a verb indicating you're trading something, often illegally.</p></div>`;
