If you shake up a soda, it will <i>fizz</i> out of the bottle when you open it.</p><p class="long">When something fizzes, you hear a hissing sound as the tiny gas bubbles are released. Any carbonated beverage will fizz when it's opened or poured, the way seltzer fizzes in a glass, or beer fizzes and foams in a mug. The word <i>fizz</i>, which has been in use since the 1600s, is imitative â€” in other words, it sounds just like what it means.</p></div>`;
