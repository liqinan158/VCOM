If you <i>tenuously</i> understand French, you're probably not fluent enough to have a meaningful conversation with your Parisian cabdriver.</p><p class="long"><i>Tenuously</i> and the adjective <i>tenuous</i> share the Latin root <i>tenuis</i>, or "thin." Things that are done tenuously have a literal or figurative thinness to them. If you're tenuously disguised as your dad, you may simply be wearing his favorite hat â€” the masquerade is truly insubstantial. And if a politician tenuously links an opponent's policies to an economic downturn, the connection is also too thin to be trusted.</p></div>`;
