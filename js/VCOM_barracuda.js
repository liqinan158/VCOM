If a scary-looking fanged fish swims in your direction when you're snorkeling in the tropics, you might want to paddle in the opposite direction as you yell, "<i>Barracuda</i>!"</p><p class="long">Humans are typically more dangerous to barracudas than the other way around, since they're popular as food. However, they are large enough that they've been known to bite swimmers, probably mistaking them for prey. Barracudas mainly live in very warm, tropical water, near coral reefs and tall sea grasses. We know this word dates from the seventeenth century from American Spanish, but beyond that its origin is a mystery.</p></div></div>`;
