You could talk about your uncle Bill's habit of speaking so <i>volubly</i> that no one else can get a word in.</p><p class="long">If you know someone who talks incessantly, you can say that she chatters volubly. A whole roomful of preschoolers sometimes talks volubly, and a talk show host might be hired because of her ability to speak volubly on a wide variety of subjects. The Latin root word is <i>volubilis</i>, "that turns around, rolling, flowing, or fluent," which in turn comes from <i>volvere</i>, "to turn around or roll."</p></div>`;
