Unless you lock it with a key or turn a bolt in the latch, it's going to stay unlocked. A more modern version of this adjective is used for mobile phones, and it means "able to operate on any carrier's network," rather than one specific network. So your <i>unlocked</i> smart phone will work with whichever phone company you choose.</p></div></div>`;
