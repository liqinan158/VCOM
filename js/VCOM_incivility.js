A child will probably be scolded for his <i>incivility</i> if he sits with his elbows planted on the dinner table, talking loudly with his mouth full of food.</p><p class="long">If you insult your friends, push in front of people standing in line for a movie, or in other ways demonstrate bad manners, your incivility is obvious. Etiquette is all about eliminating incivility, teaching people the best way to behave. This noun dates from the 16th century, first meaning "want of civilized behavior," from a Latin root: <i>incivilis</i>, "not civil," with the root <i>civilis</i>, "befitting a citizen."</p></div>`;
