var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">introduction</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">An <i>introduction</i> refers to a beginning — maybe presenting someone new to a group, or inserting a new idea into a project. In a piece of writing, the <i>introduction</i> makes clear to the reader the text's purpose.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>introduction</i> comes from the Latin verb <i>introducere</i>, meaning "to lead in." This “leading in” might be the formal introduction of a speaker, or the speaker's own introduction to his remarks. Or it might be the insertion of a new and different idea, as in British politician Lord Hailsham's remark, "The <i>introduction</i> of religious passion into politics is the end of honest politics, and the <i>introduction</i> of politics into religion is the prostitution of true religion."</p></div>`;
