The noun <i>novel</i> describes a book-length work of fiction.</p><p class="long"><i>New</i> and <i>novel</i> come from the same Indo-European root but by different paths. Whereas <i>new</i> is a Germanic word coming from Old English, <i>novel</i> is based on Latin <i>novellus</i> "new, young, fresh." If something is novel, it is new but also original, fresh and unique. Companies are always looking for that novel idea that will earn them millions and skydiving is a novel experience, especially if you're not adventurous.</p></div>`;
