Many people claim to find celebrity gossip <i>jejune</i>, but ask them about a recent movie star scandal and chances are they know all about it.</p><p class="long"><i>Jejune</i> can also describe something that’s immature or simplistic. All that actress could say about her latest movie was that it was “Super fun”? That’s a pretty jejune comment. Basically <i>jejune</i> means lacking substance. It originally comes from the Latin word <i>jejunus</i>, which means “fasting,” so when something is jejune, it’s figuratively empty — devoid of intellectual nourishment.</p></div>`;
