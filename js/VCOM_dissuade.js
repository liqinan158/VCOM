var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">dissuade</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you <i>dissuade</i> someone, you convince that person not to do something: “When Caroline saw Peter's broken leg, she tried to <i>dissuade</i> him from going on the ski trip.”</p><p class="long">Remember the meaning of <i>dissuade</i> by comparing it to its more common relative <i>persuade</i>. The <i>suade</i> part that both words share has origins in the Latin root <i>suadēre</i>, meaning “to urge.” In the case of <i>persuade</i>, the prefix <i>per-</i> means “thoroughly,” intensifying “to urge” and giving <i>persuade</i> its meaning of “to convince.” Think of <i>dissuade</i> as the opposite of <i>persuade</i>: the prefix <i>dis-</i> reverses the action of the root, giving the meaning of <i>not</i> urging, in other words, convincing someone NOT to do something.</p></div>`;
