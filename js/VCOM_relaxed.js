We're cool and collected. Rules are looser when <i>relaxed,</i> too.</p><p class="long">If anyone has ever told you "Relax! Relax!" you probably have some idea of what this word means. People are described as <i>relaxed</i> when they have no worries or stress. Being relaxed is one of the best feelings there is, and it usually leads to other good feelings like happiness and confidence. Restrictions and rules are relaxed when they become less strict. Fittingly, relaxed rules and relaxed people tend to go together, just like strict rules can make people feel nervous and uptight â€” the opposite of <i>relaxed</i>.</p></div></div>`;
