Once you try using a <i>tripod</i> for taking photographs, your sharp, beautiful pictures might make it hard to do without it.</p><p class="long">A tripod is a stand with three legs that holds a camera. Photographers and filmmakers use a tripod when they want the camera to be held completely still, without the slight bit of shaking that their hands might cause. <i>Tripod</i> comes from the Greek <i>tripodos</i>, "three-legged stool," made up of <i>tri</i>, or "three," plus <i>podos</i>, "foot." The word <i>tripod</i> was used in the past to mean anything with three legs, including vessels, stools, or tables.</p></div>`;
