An unpopular verdict might "<i>precipitate</i> violence" or one false step at the Grand Canyon could <i>precipitate</i> you down into the gorge.</p><p class="long"><i>Precipitate</i>, as a verb, can also mean specifically, "to fall from clouds," such as rain, snow, or other forms of precipitation. When used as an adjective, <i>precipitate</i> means "hasty" or "acting suddenly." If you decide to throw your class project in a trash masher just because someone in your class had a similar idea, then your actions might be described as precipitate. Or if you do that sort of thing regularly, you may be a precipitate person.</p></div></div>`;
