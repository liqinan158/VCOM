In either case, the job requires persistence and determination. Another way to slog is to walk with difficulty, the way someone might slog along a muddy road to the gas station after getting a flat tire. The original meaning of <i>slog</i> was "hit hard," possibly as a variation of <i>slug</i>.</p></div>`;
