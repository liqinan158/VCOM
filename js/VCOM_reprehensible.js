It is a strong word â€” your mother might forgive you for doing something bad, but something <i>reprehensible</i>? That's worse.</p><p class="long">If a politician steals funds that are meant to provide care for the elderly, that's reprehensible! Near synonyms of this adjective are "blameworthy" and "culpable." The word <i>reprehensible</i> is from Middle English, from Latin <i>reprehensus</i>, plus the suffix <i>-ibilis</i>, "deserving of, capable of." If someone is reprehended, they are blamed or strongly criticized.</p></div></div>`;
