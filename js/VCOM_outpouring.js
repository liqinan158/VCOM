An <i>outpouring</i> of lava from an active volcano would be a bad thing, but an <i>outpouring</i> of support from the community would be a very good thing.</p><p class="long">A literal outpouring is something you can actually see, like an outpouring of water from a hose. It's actually more common to use <i>outpouring</i> figuratively, as in an outpouring of community support for a family of refugees or an outpouring of new work by a prolific artist. This noun dates from the fifteenth century, when it was first used to describe "a pouring out of spiritual things."</p></div></div>`;
