On a rainy weekend, you and your friends might pile on the <i>sofa</i> to watch scary movies and eat popcorn.</p><p class="long">A sofa is similar to a couch â€” officially, it needs to seat at least three or more people to qualify as a sofa. If only two people can fit, it's a love seat. And if it's only big enough for you and your pet hedgehog, it's an armchair. Sofas are typically upholstered, with a high back and arms. The word originated from Turkish, from an Arabic root, <i>suffa</i>, "bench of stone or wood."</p></div></div>`;
