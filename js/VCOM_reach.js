You might <i>reach</i> for a bottle of water after you <i>reach</i> the finish line, then <i>reach</i> out to a friend who can give you a ride home.</p><p class="long">Tall people often have a really long reach – they can practically grab something from across the room. If you do what your dad says long after he’s gone, his reach is long lasting. You can reach for a glass on a high shelf or reach the age you can get your driver's license. When people reach out, they try to make a connection, like an old phone company’s slogan: “<i>Reach</i> out and touch someone.”</p></div>`;
