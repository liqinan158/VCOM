From this technical sense, it soon came to refer to good taste and to artistry in general; if something has "<i>aesthetic</i> value," it has value as a work of art (even if nobody will pay much for it). It does not, however, refer to the objects themselves; do not talk about an "<i>aesthetic</i> painting."</p></div></div>`;
