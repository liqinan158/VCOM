When you <i>discipline</i> children, you are either teaching them to be well-behaved, or you are punishing and correcting them.</p><p class="long">The origins of this word offer great clues about its current meanings. The Old French <i>descepline</i> referred to punishment and suffering. The Latin <i>disciplina</i> meant "teaching, learning." The Old English version referred to a branch of knowledge or field of study (so if you're really good at word origins, you might want to make etymology your discipline). Developing discipline as a form of training is a military concept that's more than 500 years old.</p></div>`;
