Use the same word whether you're talking about your <i>thirst</i> for lemonade on a hot day or the dire <i>thirst</i> of someone lost in a desert without water.</p><p class="long">At its most serious, <i>thirst</i> can be compared to <i>starvation</i>: "The water shortage is leading to extreme thirst in the poorest parts of the country." You can also use this word for a much milder need, like your cousin's seemingly endless thirst for root beer. Figuratively, to thirst for something is to desire it strongly: "Her thirst for knowledge means she stays up late reading the encyclopedia."</p></div>`;
