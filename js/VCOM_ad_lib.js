You might attempt to <i>ad lib</i> your part in a play instead of memorizing your lines, with disastrous results.</p><p class="long">Rap musicians sometimes ad lib, or freestyle, improvising their lyrics with no advance preparation. Improv comedy is all about the ability to ad lib lines based on what other performers are doing. The phrase <i>ad lib</i> is a shortened form of the Latin <i>ad libitum</i>, "at one's pleasure," or "as much as one likes," combining <i>ad-</i>, or "to," and <i>libitum</i>, "please" or "pleasure."</p></div></div>`;
