Yes, a bird can <i>descend</i> from the sky, but also, humans are <i>descended</i> from prehistoric ancestors.</p><p class="long">If you've ever heard a pilot say "prepare for our <i>descent</i>", then you know that only one letter separates the noun <i>descent</i> from the verb <i>descend</i>. They both derive from the same Latin components <i>de</i>, meaning "down," and <i>scandere</i>, "to climb." Similarly, if someone <i>condescends</i> to you, they are said, derogatorily, to be coming down to your level. All Americans are descended from peoples from other continents, such as Europe, Africa, and Asia. We've all "come down" from our ancestors.</p></div></div>`;
