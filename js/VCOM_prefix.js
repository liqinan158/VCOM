For example, the <i>super-</i> means "above" or "over"; <i>hypo-</i> and <i>infra-</i> mean "under." <i>Prefix</i> itself has a prefix: <i>pre-,</i> which means "before." In fact, the Latin root of <i>prefix</i> is <i>praefixus,</i> meaning "fixed in front." (Note our word's opposite here, <i>suffix,</i> which describes what is fixed at the back of a word.)</p></div></div>`;
