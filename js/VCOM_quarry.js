An animal being hunted is called <i>quarry</i>, and when you dig a hole in the earth looking for rocks, both the digging and the hole are called <i>quarry</i> as well.</p><p class="long">Gross fact: <i>Quarry</i> derives from the Latin <i>cor</i> "heart," because hunters used to drape the entrails of their chosen <i>quarry</i> on their dogs' backs. The origin in a word for "heart" can help you remember both <i>quarries</i>: a rock <i>quarry</i> is searching down toward the heart of the earth; a stag's heart is considered a hunter's greatest prize.</p></div></div>`;
