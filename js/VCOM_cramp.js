If you get a <i>cramp</i> in your leg when you're swimming, you have to stop and stretch out the muscle until the <i>cramp</i> goes away.</p><p class="long">Muscle cramps are a side effect of exercise and fatigue, and they can often be avoided by stretching before and after a run or a game of basketball. <i>Cramp</i> is also a verb, meaning both "contract painfully," and also "hold back, or prevent free movement." This is what you mean when you say, "Mom, please don't walk me in to school â€” you'll <i>cramp</i> my style."</p></div></div>`;
