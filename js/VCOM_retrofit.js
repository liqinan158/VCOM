You might <i>retrofit</i> an antique car with updated brakes and seat belts, for example.</p><p class="long">You can use <i>retrofit</i> as a verb, or it can be a noun meaning the new part itself, or something that's added on later. The solar panels on your two hundred year old house are a retrofit, and so is the fancy new stereo in your beat up old car. <i>Retrofit</i> has been around since the mid-1950s, when <i>retroactive</i> and <i>refit</i> were combined into a new word.</p></div>`;
