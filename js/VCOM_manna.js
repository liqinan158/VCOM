var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">manna</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the noun <i>manna</i> when you talk about the miraculous supply of food that the Bible describes God providing. In Exodus, the desperate Israelites received <i>manna</i> just when they most needed it.</p><p class="long">While the meaning of <i>manna</i> comes from the Old Testament of the Bible, you can use it to describe something unexpected, especially if it feels like a miracle. You might, for example, say, "The doughnuts my coworker brought in this morning were like <i>manna</i> from heaven." <i>Manna</i> has a Greek root that comes from the Hebrew <i>man</i>, and although it literally means "substance exuded by the tamarisk tree," it's almost always used to refer to God's nourishment in the Bible.</p></div>`;
