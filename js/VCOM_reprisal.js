If you attack your enemy's village and cause lots of damage, expect a <i>reprisal</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Reprisal</i> comes from the French for taking back, and used to mean the seizure of property as a compensation for some earlier loss. Now we use it more in the sense of a retaliatory attack.  When Germany bombed London during World War II, the British <i>reprisals</i> included the bombing of Berlin. <i>Reprisal</i> doesn't always have to be about war; you can use it for any act of retaliation.</p></div>`;
