var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">single-handedly</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you do something <i>single-handedly</i>, you do it on your own, with no help from anyone else. Superheroes are known for <i>single-handedly</i> defeating bad guys.</p><p class="long">Use the adverb <i>single-handedly</i> when a person achieves something independently, especially when it's especially admirable or difficult. Your mom might have single-handedly raised you and your siblings, or you might try to single-handedly move a dining room table out the front door before your yard sale. <i>Single-handedly</i> comes from the adjective <i>single-handed</i>, or "done without help," and both words have been in use since the early 1700's.</p></div>`;
