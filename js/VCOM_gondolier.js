A <i>gondolier</i> stands facing the bow while rowing with a long-handled oar.</p><p class="long">If you're a strong swimmer, an experienced canoeist, and a fluent Italian speaker, you'd make a great gondolier! Work for gondoliers is limited to Venice, Italy, a watery city made up of many islands separated by canals. Most of these bodies of water are spanned by bridges, but traveling by gondola is especially common among tourists in Venice. Both <i>gondolier</i> and <i>gondola</i> come from the Rhaetian <i>gondol√†</i>, "to rock or roll."</p></div>`;
