Other things with expiration dates include magazine subscriptions, rental agreements, and drivers' licenses. All of these are a sort of contract that eventually ends, or <i>expires</i>. When you breathe out, that's technically also <i>expiration</i>, from the Latin <i>expirare</i>, "breathe out," or "breathe one's last breath."</p></div>`;
