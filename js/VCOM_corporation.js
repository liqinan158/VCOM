In reality, a <i>corporation</i> has a very particular legal meaning: it's a company that registers with a state government such that it has the same rights and responsibilities as a person.</p><p class="long">Know the word <i>corpse</i>? It means a dead body, and comes from the Latin <i>corpus</i>, "body." One way to remember <i>corporation</i> is that it turns a company into a body — a body that is considered a person in many respects in the eyes of the law. Corporations must pay taxes and follow laws. Because it is a separate entity, when a corporation fails, its employees and managers are not responsible for its debts.</p></div></div>`;
