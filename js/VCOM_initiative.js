An <i>initiative</i> is the first in a series of actions. <i>Initiative</i> can also mean a personal quality that shows a willingness to get things done and take responsibility.</p><p class="long">An initiative is the start of something, with the hope that it will continue. Government and business start initiatives all the time. You can also talk about initiative as a personal quality. A person with initiative is motivated to do things. If you take the initiative, you're willing to get things done on your own. Taking initiative can be risky: If you do something on your own initiative, then there's nobody you can blame if it goes wrong.</p></div>`;
