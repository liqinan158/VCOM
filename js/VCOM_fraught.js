Your Thanksgiving was <i>fraught</i> with awkward moments when your family saw your blue hair, and it only got worse when you told them you'd quit law school to join the circus.</p><p class="long"><i>Fraught</i> is related to the word <i>freight</i>, and comes from the Middle English <i>fraughten</i>, meaning "to load with cargo." Think of a cargo ship loaded up with freight for a journey — it's full of supplies, just like Thanksgiving was filled with — or fraught with — awkward moments. <i>Fraught</i> can also describe a situation filled with distress. If relations between two countries are fraught, they are not getting along with each other.</p></div></div>`;
