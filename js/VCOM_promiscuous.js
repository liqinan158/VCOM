However, the word can also be used in a general sense to mean "not limited, restrained, or restricted." If you're a <i>promiscuous</i> reader, you'll read just about anything â€” from biographies to science fiction to the back of the cereal box.</p><p class="long"><i>Promiscuous</i> is not limited to a romantic context. Long ago <i>promiscuous</i> described "a disorderly mixture of people and things," and shades of that original meaning linger. If a chef at an Italian restaurant is promiscuous, you might find him mixing ingredients from South America or Asia into his pasta. Carpet bombing as opposed to targeted invasion might be called a promiscuous use of military force.</p></div></div>`;
