Instead of keeping exotic fish, however, the owner of a terrarium keeps interesting plants and occasionally reptiles like turtles or lizards. The word <i>terrarium</i> was first used in the late 1800s, and it came from the word <i>aquarium</i> â€” substituting <i>terre</i> (meaning "land") for <i>aqua</i> (meaning "water").</p></div></div>`;
