If you're going to stand up in front of a large crowd and want to be heard, you better use a <i>microphone</i>.</p><p class="long">Microphones require electricity and amplifiers to work — what they do is take a sound and convert it into an electrical signal. That signal can then be amplified and sent to a speaker or recorded. Performers can sing softly into a microphone and still be heard clearly by an audience member at the very back of a huge concert hall. The popularity of radio and film inspired this meaning of <i>microphone</i> — originally, the word meant "ear trumpet for the hard-of-hearing."</p></div>`;
