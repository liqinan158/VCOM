They might just yell, "Woohoo!" It's always been a fun-loving word; its Latin roots mean "gladden, cheer." A ride on a glass elevator with a cute vampire could be <i>exhilarating</i>, and so could a surprise party, or a ride on an old roller coaster. It can be so refreshing, you can't <i>exhale</i> after something <i>exhilarating</i> happens.</p></div></div>`;
