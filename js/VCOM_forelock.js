It's also an old fashioned way to describe a person's bangs.</p><p class="long"><i>Forelock</i> comes from the Old English <i>forelocca</i>, from <i>fore</i>, "before in position," and <i>locc</i>, "curl or lock of hair." It originally meant simply "a lock of hair above the forehead," and in the 1800s, men commonly greeted each other by "tugging the <i>forelock</i>." Today people are likely to assume you're talking about a horse if you use the word <i>forelock</i>.</p></div></div>`;
