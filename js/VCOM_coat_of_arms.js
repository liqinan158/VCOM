Originally appearing on shields or flags, <i>coats of arms</i> were once used as a way of distinguishing one knight from another on a battlefield.</p><p class="long">There are strict formal rules governing which colors and symbols are depicted on coats of arms and how they are arranged. The pictures on coats of arms also have specific symbolic meanings; for example, the lion is typically a symbol of bravery. Sometimes a coat of arms represents a government or organization, like Finland's coat of arms, which features a yellow lion wearing a crown and brandishing a sword against a red (or <i>gules</i>) background. The study, classification, and design of coats of arms is known as <i>heraldry</i>.</p></div></div>`;
