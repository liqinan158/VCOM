An experience that changes you <i>forever</i> alters you in ways that will last the rest of your life.</p><p class="long">The adverb <i>forever</i> literally means "eternally," so when you promise, "I'll love you <i>forever</i>." you mean it. You can also use <i>forever</i> in a less literal, more exaggerated way: "It is taking <i>forever</i> for the bus to get here," or to mean "without stopping," as when you comment that the rain can't continue forever. The word combines <i>for</i> and <i>ever</i>, which stems from the Old English <i>æfre</i>, "always."</p></div>`;
