You are a <i>barterer</i> if you trade your scooter for a skateboard.</p><p class="long">The word <i>barterer</i> most likely comes from the Old French word <i>barater,</i> which means "to deceive." So barterers were probably thought to be untrustworthy in trade. Nowadays, though, a barterer is just someone who engages in trade without using money. This might be by choice or because of the tradition of a country or culture.</p></div></div>`;
