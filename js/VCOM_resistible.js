In other words, you find it easy to resist.</p><p class="long">You might find a used car salesman's style to be completely resistible, and leave the car lot without spending a dime. Or you could explain that you find the death metal genre of music to be resistible when your friend asks why you won't go to a concert with him. <i>Irresistible</i> is more commonly used than <i>resistible</i>, but both words stem from the Latin <i>resistere</i>, "to resist or withstand," from <i>re</i>, "against," and <i>sistere</i>, "take a stand."</p></div></div>`;
