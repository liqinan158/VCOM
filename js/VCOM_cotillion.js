This was a quick, lively sort of dance that must have been a lot of fun back in the day. More recently, a cotillion became the name of a ball (dance event) in the United States. Debutantes — young society ladies — are presented at cotillions. So when you think of cotillions, think of fancy-schmancy dances and high society.</p></div></div>`;
