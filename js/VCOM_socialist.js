The original 19th century socialists were Marxists who believed that workers, and society, should have total control of the means of production. This economic philosophy (and the accompanying politics) is known as <i>socialism</i>. Today's socialists hold a wide variety of beliefs, from community ownership of land and businesses to government control of goods and services for the public good, funded through taxation.</p></div>`;
