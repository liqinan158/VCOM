If you're a <i>faithful</i> volunteer at the animal shelter, you show up every Saturday and work hard to help the animals.</p><p class="long">A faithful friend is loyal and steadfast â€” it's no wonder that many people consider their dogs to be their most faithful companions. Though <i>faithful</i> usually describes a person, you can also use it to talk about a particularly reliable object, like your faithful hiking boots. There's another sense of <i>faithful</i> that means "remaining true to," like faithful believers who pray and attend religious services regularly.</p></div>`;
