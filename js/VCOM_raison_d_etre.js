It's why they do things.</p><p class="long">In French, <i>raison d'etre</i> literally means "reason for being," and in English it means about the same. Someone's raison d'etre is the most important thing to them: Michael Jordan's raison d'etre was basketball. Beethoven's raison d'etre was music. A raison d'etre motivates a person; it's their purpose. Taking care of your family could be your raison d'etre, and so could your career. <i>Raison d'etre</i> is a strong term for something that gives a person's life meaning.</p></div></div>`;
