If you <i>befoul</i> your shoes in the mud, don't wear them inside the house or you'll also <i>befoul</i> the carpet.</p><p class="long">You can use this verb to mean pollute or contaminate: "Dumping those chemicals down the drain will eventually befoul our town's drinking water." It's also good for anything that gets gross and dirty, like when you befoul a brand new sweater by spilling mustard on it. Figuratively, <i>befoul</i> means "damage," the way gossip can befoul someone's reputation.</p></div>`;
