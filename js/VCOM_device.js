You might have one device for opening bottles, and another for opening cans. You probably even have a <i>device</i> for turning on your TV. While these have specific names (bottle opener, can opener, remote), you can cover each with the generic term <i>device</i>.  We can see its root in the Old French word <i>devis</i>, which meant “purpose” or “contrivance.”</p></div></div>`;
