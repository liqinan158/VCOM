In Paris you can stroll from <i>merchant</i> to <i>merchant</i>, buying a loaf of bread in one shop and a wedge of cheese in another.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>merchant</i> has its Latin roots in the word <i>merchari</i>, meaning to trade. Other words from the same root include "market," "merchandise," and "mercantile." In some areas, independent merchants have banded together to combine advertising dollars and compete against malls and big box stores. You should ask your neighborhood book merchant if they've considered joining a group like this.</p></div>`;
