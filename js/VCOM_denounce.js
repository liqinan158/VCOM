When you stand on your desk and tell the class that your partner is cheating, you <i>denounce</i> him or her.</p><p class="long">The prefix <i>de-</i> means "down," as in <i>destroy</i> or <i>demolish</i> (tear down). Add that to the Latin root <i>nuntiare</i>, meaning "announce," and <i>de-</i> plus <i>announce</i> equals <i>denounce</i>. It's a word that shows up in the headlines often, as a country might denounce a corrupt election. Politicians love to denounce the shady behavior or their opponents. <i>Denounce</i> can also mean the official end of something, like a treaty.</p></div></div>`;
