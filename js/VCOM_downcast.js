Rest assured that there are, and one of them is <i>downcast.</i></p><p class="long"><i>Downcast</i> most frequently describes a person's mood: downhearted, down in the mouth, down in the dumps, just plain old down. It can also refer to the direction in which something is pointed â€” down. Your eyes, for instance, gazing downward, are downcast. And many times when your eyes are looking that way, it's because you're feeling that way.</p></div></div>`;
