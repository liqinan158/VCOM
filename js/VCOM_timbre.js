If you play the same note on a piano and on a guitar, each note will have its own <i>timbre</i>.</p><p class="long">Though an electric saw has its own <i>timbre</i>, as does the sound of a tree whooshing through the air, don't confuse <i>timbre</i> with "<i>Timber!</i>" the word you shout when chopping down trees. <i>Timbre</i> comes from the Greek word that means drum. <i>Timber</i> stems from an Old English word for building materials.</p></div>`;
