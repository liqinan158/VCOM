The soft sheets, large television, and chocolates on the pillow in your fancy hotel room all contribute to its <i>luxuriance</i>.</p><p class="long">If you're used to taking the bus to school and work, even on cold winter mornings, you'll enjoy a few days riding in the luxuriance of your friend's brand new car with its heated leather seats. And if you travel to a country where people have trouble finding enough food to eat, you'll appreciate the relative luxuriance of your comfortable life and fully stocked refrigerator. <i>Luxuriance</i> comes from the Latin <i>luxuriare</i>, "have to excess."</p></div>`;
