City buses often reach stops at a <i>frequency</i> of every 15 minutes, unless it's snowing or raining really hard. In that case, the <i>frequency</i> will slow.</p><p class="long">You probably know the word <i>frequent</i>, a synonym for <i>often</i>. So, it is tempting to think <i>frequency</i> describes something that happens often. However, this isn't true: <i>frequency</i> describes any rate of time at which something repeats. For example, from Earth, Halley's Comet is visible at a frequency of 76 years â€” it's not frequent, but it is on schedule.</p></div>`;
