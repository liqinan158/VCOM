It can also be a <i>state</i> as in Idaho or New York. To <i>state</i> is to say something.</p><p class="long"><i>State</i> comes from the Latin <i>status</i>, meaning "condition of a country." Interestingly, even before the Revolutionary War, Britain called the American colonies states. The “States” still refers to America, but state can refer to any country’s civil government. The idea of <i>state</i> as a physical or emotional condition came later. Depending on your state of mind, you can state that the state of your state is awesome. Unless it’s in a state of emergency, which is no good.</p></div></div>`;
