var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">sullenly</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Someone who acts <i>sullenly</i> seems gloomy, dissatisfied â€” not happy to be there. If you act <i>sullenly</i> at your grandparents' anniversary party, you can expect to be taken aside and told, "Cheer up. Now."</p><p class="long">The picture of someone acting sullenly? It's a person slumped in a chair, arms crossed, sighing a lot. The adverb <i>sullenly</i> is used to describe something that's done glumly, or in a very bad-tempered way. Anyone who is in the mood to complain will speak or respond sullenly, like a little kid who's been dragged along on a car trip and speaks up sullenly from time to time to ask, "Are we there yet?"</p></div></div>`;
