A <i>bilingual</i> woman might speak Spanish and English, and a part of town where people speak Mandarin and Polish is a <i>bilingual</i> neighborhood.</p><p class="long">The prefix <i>bi</i>- means “having two,” and the Latin word <i>lingua</i> means “tongue, language,” so <i>bilingual</i> literally means “having two tongues.”  It would be a mouthful to have two physical tongues, but luckily <i>bilingual</i> is for language tongues: the ability to speak two languages fluently.   <i>Bilingual</i> is also a noun, and a person can be called a bilingual, like in the African country Chad, where the official languages are French and Arabic, and where many of the citizens are bilinguals.</p></div></div>`;
