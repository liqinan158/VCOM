A <i>lectern</i> is a stand on which you can place notes or papers while you lecture.</p><p class="long">Lecterns often feature a sloped top and a little lamp to make reading from a paper or notes easier. The word <i>lectern</i> comes from the Latin word <i>legere</i> which means "to read." Lecterns serve another purpose for nervous readers â€” they offer a good hiding place for shaking hands.</p></div></div>`;
