It is a verbal attack that doesn't let up, delivered as a verb or received as a noun. Either way, it's pretty unpleasant.</p><p class="long">The word <i>harangue</i> developed its modern spelling around 1530, when the word was recorded as <i>harangue</i> in French. The word, meaning a strong, nasty rant, appears to have evolved from the Old Italian word <i>aringa</i>, probably from the word for a public square or place for public speaking. This in turn appears to have evolved from a Germanic word related to <i>ring</i>, as in "circular gathering," which is clearly similar to the Italian meaning.</p></div></div>`;
