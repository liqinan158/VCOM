It's possible to seek fame, or snacks, or a college degree, or approval â€” as long as you're looking for it, or longing for it, you're seeking it. The origins of the word <i>seek</i> go back to the Latin word <i>sagire</i>, which means "to perceive keenly by scent." Imagine a dog tracking a rabbit, sniffing the ground and following its scent, and you'll know exactly what it means to seek something.</p></div></div>`;
