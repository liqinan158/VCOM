When you <i>pawn</i> a necklace at a <i>pawn</i> shop, you get cash in exchange for it with the understanding that you can buy it back later.</p><p class="long">The benefit when you pawn something is getting cash immediately. The down side is that you'll have to pay more money — the amount you borrowed, plus interest — to get your item back. If you aren't able to do this, the pawn shop will sell it to someone else. As a noun, a <i>pawn</i> is the smallest, least powerful piece in a game of chess, or a description of a person who's being used or manipulated.</p></div>`;
