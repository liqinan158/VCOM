In other words, it may cost more for a US company to make a t-shirt than a Chinese company, but if the US's protectionism means a high tax on the Chinese t-shirts (making them more expensive to US buyers), they won't threaten the American company's business in the same way. Quotas and regulations are other tools of protectionism. <i>Protectionism</i> comes from the idea that the government is protecting its industries.</p></div></div>`;
