You and your friends might have a <i>seance</i> in an attempt to speak to Amelia Earhart.</p><p class="long">Someone who believes in spirits that linger even after people's physical bodies are gone may also be enthusiastic about seances. A typical seance involves a group of people sitting around a table, sometimes including a <i>medium</i> who claims an ability to communicate with spirits and relay messages to their loved ones. In French, <i>séance</i> means "a sitting," and it's often simply used to mean "a session," like <i>une séance de cinéma</i>, "a movie session."</p></div></div>`;
