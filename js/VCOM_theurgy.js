If you believe that an actual miracle allowed your favorite football team to win an important game, you can call it an act of <i>theurgy</i>.</p><p class="long">One kind of theurgy is accepted and seen as true in many Christian churches â€” it's God getting directly involved in our affairs, through miracles or divine intervention. Other kinds of theurgy involve magic, as in casting spells and doing magical rituals. The word comes from the Greek <i>theourgia</i>, "sorcery," which in turn is rooted in <i>theos</i>, or "god."</p></div>`;
