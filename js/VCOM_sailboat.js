When the wind is strong enough, <i>sailboats</i> can move very quickly. Ahoy!</p><p class="long">Sailboats, called <i>sailing boats</i> in Britain, can have anywhere from one to as many as five sails. Larger water vessels that move using sails are distinguished as "sailing ships" rather than sailboats. You might take a tour on a schooner, a large sailboat with two masts, or take a sailing lesson in a small, single-sail dingy. No matter which kind of sailboat, it moves by angling its sails into the wind.</p></div>`;
