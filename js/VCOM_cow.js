Cows are typically domesticated farm animals, though the females of wilder bovine relatives are also called cows. The verb form of <i>cow</i>, "to frighten or subdue," comes from the docile nature of most cows â€” they are fairly easy to intimidate, or easily cowed. The Old English root is <i>cu</i>, from the Indo-European <i>gwous</i>, which might have developed from the sound that cows make.</p></div></div>`;
