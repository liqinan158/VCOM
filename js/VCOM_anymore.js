Your grandfather might complain that there aren't any good family movies <i>anymore</i>.</p><p class="long">If you don't do something anymore, it means you once did it but now you don't: "Yeah, I don't take Irish step dancing lessons <i>anymore</i>." If you put your fingers in your ears while your brother is talking, you make it clear you're not listening anymore. Sometimes <i>anymore</i> is spelled as two words, <i>any more</i> â€” both are considered correct, with <i>anymore</i> being more common in the US.</p></div>`;
