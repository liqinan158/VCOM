To <i>pander</i> is to appease or gratify, and often in a negative, self-serving way.</p><p class="long">The word <i>pander</i> began its infamous history as the name of various characters. Pandaro was a character in Boccaccio’s <i>Filostrato</i>. Pandarus was a character in Chaucer’s <i>Troilus and Criseyde</i>, as well as in Shakespeare’s <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>. These literary works all tell the tale of star-crossed lovers, and the namesake of <i>pander</i> is, essentially, a go-between whose motives don't seem entirely pure.</p></div></div>`;
