Usually, workbooks are paperbacks filled with problems or exercises that you're meant to do right in the workbook, rather than on a separate sheet of paper. Elementary school students might have workbooks for practicing printing letters or doing simple math, while high school students may use a workbook to prepare for taking a test like the SAT.</p></div>`;
