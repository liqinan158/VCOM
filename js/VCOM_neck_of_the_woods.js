You might complain that there's no good pizza in your <i>neck of the woods</i>.</p><p class="long">Use <i>neck of the woods</i> to describe your surroundings. Your street is your neck of the woods, but so is your region: if you live in New Hampshire, you might describe the entire New England area as your neck of the woods. The phrase comes from the sense of <i>neck</i> as a strip of land. In Britain, this refers to land with water on both sides, but early Americans used it to mean "a settlement in the woods."</p></div></div>`;
