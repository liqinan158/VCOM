Just wait for your <i>endorphins</i> to kick in. An <i>endorphin</i> is a hormone that your body produces to ease pain and make you feel calm and happy.</p><p class="long">Endorphins are sometimes called "natural pain killers," since that's the way they act in the body. Things like stress and exercise can stimulate the release of endorphins. A “runner’s high” happens when a runner gets a rush of endorphins. Your nervous system and pituitary gland send endorphins to your brain, where they bind to special receptors. It's similar to what happens when you take a painkilling medication. In fact, the word <i>endorphin</i> is a blend of “endogenous” (meaning "inside the body") and “morphine" (a medication that relieves pain).</p></div></div>`;
