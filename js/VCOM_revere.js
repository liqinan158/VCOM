Many Americans <i>revere</i> civil rights activists like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rosa Parks, who worked to make the country a more just place.</p><p class="long"><i>Revere</i> is related to the words <i>reverence</i> ("to hold something in worshipful awe") and its opposite â€” <i>irreverent</i>. Reverence for the irreverent is actually possible. Howard Stern humor is often vulgar and absurdly irreverent yet his legions of fans and even some media analysts <i>revere</i> him and his ability to maintain a loyal audience. <i>Revere</i> is the perfect word when <i>respect</i> is not strong enough but <i>worship</i> seems a little too religious-sounding. Rock stars, for example, are <i>revered</i> by throngs of devoted fans.</p></div>`;
