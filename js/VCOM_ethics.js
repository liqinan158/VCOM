You might call a politician who uses taxpayer money for wild parties a little "<i>ethics</i>-challenged."</p><p class="long"><i>Ethics</i> can mean the study of morality â€” what's right and wrong. When discussing this branch of philosophy, treat the word as singular, despite the "-s": "<i>Ethics</i> is no longer widely taught." But in the sense of "moral correctness" or "a moral code," treat it as plural: "The <i>ethics</i> of capital punishment are complex." Don't confuse it with <i>ethos</i>, which means "the characteristic spirit of a culture." (Both words come from Greek <i>ethos</i>, "moral character.")</p></div>`;
