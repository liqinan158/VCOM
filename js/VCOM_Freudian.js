A Freudian analyst, for example, typically spends a lot of time exploring her patient's childhood, interpreting dreams, and encouraging free association, or talking freely about whatever comes into the patient's head. Another common use of the adjective is in the term "<i>Freudian</i> slip," a mistake, especially in speech, which supposedly has a deeper subconscious meaning.</p></div></div>`;
