A rodeo is a place where cowboys demonstrate what they can do for a crowd. Many of these skills are dangerous, like wrestling a steer or riding a bull. Some skills involve lassos and other uses of rope, such as roping (tying up) a goat. These skills are for entertainment at a rodeo, but they're necessary on a cattle ranch.</p></div></div>`;
