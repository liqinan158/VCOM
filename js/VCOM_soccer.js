To win a <i>soccer</i> match, your side has to kick the ball into the goal more times than your rivals do. Go team!</p><p class="long">In most parts of the world, soccer is known as <i>football</i>, which makes sense since players (except the goalie) can't touch the ball with their hands â€” they mainly control and move it with their feet. In the U.S., however, football is a completely different sport, one that's known as <i>American football</i> everywhere else,. <i>Soccer</i> comes from <i>socca</i>, slang for <i>Assoc.</i>, which is a shortened version of <i>Association football</i>.</p></div></div>`;
