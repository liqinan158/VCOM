Fishermen tend to <i>exaggerate</i> the size of their fish. And children tend to <i>exaggerate</i> the seriousness of their cuts in order to get cute Band-Aids.</p><p class="long">We all have a tendency to exaggerate. It makes our stories funnier, or more dramatic. After all, when you exaggerate, you're not really lying â€” you're just overstating things. The word exaggerate can also suggest that a particular characteristic is overdone or almost larger than life. If you describe someone as having an exaggerated limp, he or she might be walking like a gorilla.</p></div>`;
