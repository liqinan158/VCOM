It's easier to climb a fence while wearing <i>trousers</i> than a long dress.</p><p class="long">In the U.S., most people refer to trousers as <i>pants</i>, while in the U.K. <i>pants</i> are underwear. If you cut your trousers off above your knees, they become shorts, and if they're made out of denim, you can call them <i>jeans</i>. In Scotland, trousers are sometimes called <i>trews</i>, one possible root of the word. Another source may be the Gaelic <i>triubhas</i>, "close-fitting shorts."</p></div></div>`;
