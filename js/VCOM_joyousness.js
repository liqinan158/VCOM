Your math class will erupt in <i>joyousness</i> at the news that a difficult exam is cancelled.</p><p class="long">Joyousness is the state of experiencing <i>joy</i>, and we can trace the origin of both words back to the Latin root <i>gaudia</i>, "expressions of pleasure." Your joyousness often comes out when you're celebrating something wonderful, like your great-grandfather's birthday, or getting your driver's license, or the return of a long-lost friend. But there can also be a sense of joyousness during quieter moments of deep happiness.</p></div>`;
