They usually have the same number of lines each time, and often use a rhyming pattern that repeats with each new <i>stanza</i>.</p><p class="long">Shakespeare was the master of the stanza.  His sonnets had three stanzas that were each four lines long, and then a two-line stanza at the end, all with a very particular rhyme and rhythm pattern.  Poems with stanzas always have some sort of structure to them, but not all poetry uses stanzas, for example â€” free verse tends to be wild poetry without structural rules.</p></div>`;
