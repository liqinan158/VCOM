If your new house is surrounded by dirt, you might want to hire a <i>landscaper</i> to help you choose some pretty plants for your front yard.</p><p class="long">The job of a landscaper can range from planning an enormous urban park, choosing shade-loving plants for a homeowner, or designing a school playground. Generally, any large outdoor project involving plants requires a landscaper. An experienced landscaper knows how to grade the soil, plan for weather, and lay out a garden that will both look attractive and provide usable space. This word comes from Middle Dutch roots, <i>land</i>, "land," and <i>scap</i>, "condition."</p></div>`;
