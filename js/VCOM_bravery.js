It takes <i>bravery</i> for a knight to battle a dragon, but it also takes <i>bravery</i> for a shy child to walk into a new classroom.</p><p class="long">You can also call bravery <i>courage</i> or <i>valor</i>. Firefighters are often acknowledged for their bravery, but everyday people also act with bravery if they confront their fears. Even though you're scared when you jump out of the plane with your skydiving instructor, the fact that you're doing it at all takes real bravery. It also takes bravery to pet a friend's German shepherd, especially if you are afraid of dogs. The earliest meaning of <i>bravery</i> was closer to <i>bravado</i>: "daring, defiance, and boasting."</p></div></div>`;
