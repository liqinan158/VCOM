And, like unicorns, you probably won't spot one (unless you are traveling the Arctic waters near Greenland).</p><p class="long">Only male narwhals have a distinctive ivory tusk, which is actually a long, protruding canine tooth. It's a medium-sized whale, related to the beluga, and it's able to dive underwater for up to 25 minutes at a time. <i>Narwhal</i> comes from the Danish <i>narhval</i>, with the Old Norse root <i>nahvalr</i> literally meaning "corpse whale," for the narwhal's pale white color, thought to resemble the shade of a dead body.</p></div></div>`;
