It's not legal in the U.S. to <i>retry</i> a defendant for a crime after she's been found innocent.</p><p class="long">A judge might decide to retry a case if the jury can't come to a unanimous decision, or if a jury member is found to be biased. And when the defendant in a case is found guilty, they can appeal the decision in the hopes that the court will retry it, sometimes using a new attorney or new evidence. You probably won't use this verb to literally mean "try again" â€” you're more likely to say <i>reattempt</i>.</p></div></div>`;
