Cytoplasm consists of all the substances within the cell walls but outside of the nucleus: a fluid called cytosol, organelles such as the mitochondria, and tiny particles in suspension called inclusions. Cytoplasm is full of proteins, which are essential to your body. Cytoplasm is also called protoplasm. To see cytoplasm, you'll need a good microscope. To understand cytoplasm, you'll need a good biology teacher.</p></div>`;
