Yet many English words come from French. When the French conquered England in 1066, they brought with them their language as well as their social system. Because French was spoken mostly by the ruling class, many of the loan words are formal. <i>Decry</i> comes from the Old French <i>descrier,</i> "to cry out" or "announce." When you decry something, you simultaneously condemn it and discredit it, a formal act.</p></div></div>`;
