If you hand in a <i>sketch</i>, instead of your full paper, don't expect to get a very high grade!</p><p class="long">The word <i>sketch</i> can be used when talking about something visual, particularly a drawing. An artist might sketch a friend in an hour, and then go home and take weeks to complete the portrait. A <i>sketch</i> can also refer to a short verbal or narrative account. You might want to give your friend a brief sketch of what happened to you today, instead of boring her with every last detail, including the hours you spent washing and then folding your laundry.</p></div></div>`;
