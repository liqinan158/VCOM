If you hear a truck <i>rumble</i> down your street, don’t put up your dukes — to <i>rumble</i> also means to make a low, deep sound.</p><p class="long">Thunder rumbles just before you see lightning flash, and dogs sometimes rumble a low warning growl when they see someone unfamiliar. As a noun, <i>rumble</i> can mean "a low sound," “a seat in the back of a carriage” (the rumble seat) or " a street fight." It's a little old fashioned today to call a gang brawl a rumble, but if you've ever seen the movie "West Side Story," you've seen the rumble between the Jets and the Sharks.</p></div>`;
