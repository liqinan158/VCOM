A Rube Goldberg machine is like a giant chain of <i>proximate</i> causes – one action causes another.</p><p class="long">Use the adjective <i>proximate</i> for things that are close to each other or somehow related. Like the noun <i>proximity</i>, or nearby area, it comes from the Latin root, <i>proximus</i>, "nearest." In legal terms, you may have a case if the proximate cause of a fall was someone’s negligence.  You can use proximate to mean "imminent" (or close by, but in terms of time), as in "The <i>proximate</i> publication of her story made her both nervous and excited."</p></div></div>`;
