Money, for instance, is convertible because it can be changed from one currency to another — for example, from dollars to euros. A sofa bed is convertible because it can be transformed from a sofa into a bed. Likewise, a convertible jacket is a jacket that can be changed (by removing the sleeves or an inner lining) depending on the weather.</p></div></div>`;
