A putsch is a quick and dirty overthrow of a government; it tends to be used most often for places that experience a lot of these. <i>Putsch</i> comes from the Swiss German word of the same spelling, which means "revolt," or "a sudden blow or push." Another word for a putsch is a <i>coup d'état</i>.</p></div>`;
