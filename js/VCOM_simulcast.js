Another kind of <i>simulcast</i> is a live broadcast.</p><p class="long">You can call a station's broadcast of the Superbowl or the Academy Awards a <i>simulcast</i>, although this is a newer way to use this word. It was coined in the 1940s, during the early days of television, from a portmanteau (or blend) of <i>simultaneous</i> and <i>broadcast</i>, specifically describing shows broadcast on radio and TV at the same time. If a concert is aired on two radio stations at once, that's also a simulcast.</p></div></div>`;
