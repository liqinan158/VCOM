A <i>ridge</i> is a line that rises above what it is attached to.</p><p class="long">Think of a <i>ridge</i> as a combination between <i>rim</i> and <i>edge</i>. From the Old English <i>hrycg</i>, meaning “back of the man or beast” or “the top or crest” of something (combined, the senses mean “backbone”), <i>ridge</i> is often used for the beam that joins the parts of a sloping roof. <i>Ridge</i> also refers to the line formed by hills or mountains, as in the Blue Ridge Mountains. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is made up of mountains that lie underneath the Atlantic Ocean.</p></div>`;
