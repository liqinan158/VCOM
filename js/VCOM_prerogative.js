As Bobby Brown once sang, "I don't need permission / Make my own decisions / That's my <i>prerogative</i>."</p><p class="long"><i>Prerogative</i> goes back to a Latin root for a group having the right to vote first (<i>prae-</i>, "pre-" + <i>rogare</i>, "to ask") and thus came to mean "privileged rank." In current use, it refers to a right or privilege held by any person or group. A near synonym is <i>privilege</i>, which puts more emphasis on the fact that others do not have it. The self-justifying phrase "That's my prerogative" (for example, in reference to changing one's mind) is quite common.</p></div></div>`;
