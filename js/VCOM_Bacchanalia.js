Specifically, a <i>Bacchanalia</i> celebrated the god of wine.</p><p class="long">When the noun <i>Bacchanalia</i> starts with a capital <i>B</i>, it means the Greek festival honoring Bacchus, the god of wine, wine making, and the grape harvest. This festival, not surprisingly, involves a lot of wine drinking. <i>Bacchanalia</i> clearly comes from the name Bacchus — <i>Bakkhos</i> in Greek — and when it's not capitalized, it can refer to any crazy party, especially if alcohol is involved.</p></div></div>`;
