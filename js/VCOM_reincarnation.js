Certain religions hold this belief as a central tenet, including Hinduism and Buddhism.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>reincarnation</i> comes from the Latin roots <i>re</i>, meaning again, and <i>incarnare</i>, meaning to make flesh. The word <i>reincarnation</i> does not have to be a literal rebirth, however. The term can be used to mean a more figurative reinvention or rebirth. Your dad may have spent twenty years of his life working as a stockbroker, but after he reinvented himself, you'd be proud of his reincarnation as a math teacher.</p></div>`;
