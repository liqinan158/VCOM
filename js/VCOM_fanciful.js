The adjective refers to something not quite real, usually something with a whimsical or even dreamlike quality.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>fanciful</i> sprang from the 15th-century noun <i>fancy</i>, which was in turn a short version of the word <i>fantasy</i>. All three words contain the same elemental meaning, that of something unreal. Someone who is <i>fanciful</i> usually allows creative thought rather than the practical to come to the forefront. Edgar Allan Poe said, "It will be found, in fact, that the ingenious are always <i>fanciful</i>, and the truly imaginative never otherwise than analytic."</p></div></div>`;
