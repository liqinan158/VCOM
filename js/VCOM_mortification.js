The word <i>mortification</i> has its roots in the Latin word for "death," <i>mors</i>. The original meaning of <i>mortification</i> was religious; in Christianity the meaning is "putting your sin to death". In Christian practice, this has varied from denying oneself pleasurable things, like certain foods, to inflicting physical pain on oneself. The religious reason for this kind of mortification is to cause the "death" of sins — or desires — of the body.</p></div>`;
