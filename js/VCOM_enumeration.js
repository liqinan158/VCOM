A waiter's lengthy <i>enumeration</i> of all the available salad dressings might seem a little hostile if he begins with a deep sigh.</p><p class="long">When you're reciting a list of things, it's enumeration. Your enumeration of complaints about your hotel room might be received with a smile by the manager, but she may be silently engaging in her own enumeration of the reasons she doesn't want you at her hotel. The root of the word "number" — <i>numer</i>, from the Latin <i>numerus</i> — is hiding in the middle of <i>enumeration</i>. Just remember to leave out the <i>b</i> from <i>number</i> when you spell it.</p></div>`;
