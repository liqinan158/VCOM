If your boss or principal asks to see you, you go to their office at their <i>behest</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Behest</i> rhymes with "request" and they almost mean the same thing, if you give your request a little authoritative oomph, just a tad bit of "or else." Another difference between these words is that you can't use <i>behest</i> as a verb: You can't behest someone. You act according to their behest. The root word here is the Old English <i>hehaes,</i> means "a vow."</p></div>`;
