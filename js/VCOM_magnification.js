You might use <i>magnification</i> to inspect a rare penny, or even a zit. You decide.</p><p class="long">Some small objects, like cells, require magnification to be seen at all. Other things, like distant planets, are so far away that you need the magnification of a telescope to get a good look at them. Binoculars use magnification so you can see the details of birds close-up, and reading glasses use magnification for reading small print. <i>Magnification</i> comes from the Latin word <i>magnificare</i>, "esteem greatly" or "make much of."</p></div>`;
