var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">denunciatory</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Like to play the blame game? Try the adjective <i>denunciatory</i>! Anything <i>denunciatory</i> reproaches someone or threatens to punish them. If you blame the mayor for your town’s woes, write a <i>denunciatory</i> editorial for the local paper.</p><p class="long">This adjective comes from the verb <i>denounce</i>, "to declare to be wrong or evil," which originally simply meant "announce." The Latin root is <i>denuntiare</i>, "announce or proclaim." Denunciatory comments are often public — you point out bad stuff someone has done so other people will know and punish them for it. It’s not just for people – a denunciatory speech about plastic bags might make people stop using them, or at least it would make them aware of the downside.</p></div>`;
