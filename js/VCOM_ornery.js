Oscar the Grouch? Definitely <i>ornery</i>.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>ornery</i> sprung up in the early 19th century when people started pronouncing <i>ordinary</i> with an accent.  The root of <i>ordinary</i> is the Latin word for “order,” and if you disrupt the orderly existence of an ornery person, prepare to get yelled at.  A person can have a consistently ornery personality, or maybe you’re feeling ornery today because you skipped breakfast.  Some synonyms for <i>ornery</i> are <i>cantankerous</i> and <i>crotchety</i>, words that sound as grumpy as the people they describe.</p></div></div>`;
