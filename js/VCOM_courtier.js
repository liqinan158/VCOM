Among the <i>courtiers</i> of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II is Edward Young, her private secretary.</p><p class="long">Courtiers are workers in a king or queen's royal court, or "those who attend the court of a sovereign." Famous courtiers include Anne Boleyn, who attended King Henry VIII's wife Catherine of Aragon before marrying the king herself, becoming his second wife, and eventually being beheaded for treason. In Shakespeare's <i>Hamlet</i>, the comic courtiers Rosencrantz and Guildenstern also end up beheaded. In fact, it might be wise to choose a career other than courtier.</p></div>`;
