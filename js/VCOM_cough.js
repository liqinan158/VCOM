A <i>bad</i> cough can make it very hard to sleep at night.</p><p class="long">A cough is evidence that someone's sick, and it's a verb as well: "She began to <i>cough</i> and couldn't stop until someone brought her a bottle of water." You can also describe a cough-like sound that an engine makes when it's not working properly as a <i>cough</i>. The Old English source of <i>cough</i> is <i>coughen</i>, from a Germanic root â€” every version of the word is imitative, the word itself sounding like a cough.</p></div></div>`;
