You can usually identify a lyric poem by its musicality: if you can imagine singing it, it's probably lyric. In ancient Greece and Rome, lyric poems were in fact sung to the strums of an accompanying lyre. It's the word <i>lyre</i>, in fact, that is at the root of <i>lyric</i>; the Greek <i>lyrikos</i> means "singing to the lyre."</p></div>`;
