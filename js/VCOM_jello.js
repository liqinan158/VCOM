When you're recovering from having your wisdom teeth removed, <i>jello</i> may be the only thing you feel like eating for a while.</p><p class="long">Desserts made with gelatin are often generally referred to as <i>jello</i> (or <i>jelly</i> in the U.K.) although the official trademarked name is <i>Jell-O</i>. This light, sweet treat is a favorite of kids who like its bright colors and jiggly consistency. It's also common in hospitals, since eating jello is an easy way for patients to get extra hydration. So-called "jello salads" contain fruit, marshmallows, and nuts, suspended within the molded jello.</p></div></div>`;
