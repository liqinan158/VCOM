It also means to continue; if you keep hula hooping you’ll break the world record!</p><p class="long"><i>Keep</i> has many senses in English, and shows up in a lot of our common expressions, like “<i>keep</i> out!" and "<i>keep</i> your shirt on!" The word generally has the senses of hold onto, maintain, stay, continue, or protect from harm. Food that will not spoil yet will <i>keep</i>. You can keep a secret, keep a diary, or keep your little sister safe. You can also keep a ritual or religious custom by practicing it –- like to keep kosher. Whatever you do, “just <i>keep</i> going.”</p></div>`;
