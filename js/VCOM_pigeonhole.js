var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">pigeonhole</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>pigeonhole</i> is a small nesting area for a pigeon, or a similarly cozy compartment or alcove. If you feel like you're stuck in a restrictive category — only thought of as someone's sister, for example — that's another kind of <i>pigeonhole</i>.</p><p class="long">A cubbyhole in your desk is one kind of pigeonhole, and the little box where a domesticated pigeon sleeps is another. These original meanings date from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. By the 1870s, <i>pigeonhole</i> had also come to mean "an overly simplistic or restrictive category," and also "to assign someone to a rigid category." So when you assume that a circus clown couldn't also be a brilliant mathematician, you have pigeonholed him.</p></div>`;
