If you suddenly catch a ball before it crashes into a window, you have quick <i>reflexes</i>.</p><p class="long">When a doctor hits your knee with a little hammer during a physical, it makes your leg kick, even though you didn't consciously make your leg move. The doctor is testing your reflexes — movements that happen without your control. If your reflexes aren't working, it could mean there's something wrong with your body. Putting your hands out when you fall is a reflex. So is laughing so hard you snort.</p></div></div>`;
