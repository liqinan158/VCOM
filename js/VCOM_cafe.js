Your neighborhood <i>cafe</i> might be a good place to get a piece of pie and a cup of coffee.</p><p class="long">You could stop by a cafe for lunch, or just grab a coffee and a muffin to go. You can also call a cafe a "coffeehouse" or "coffee shop," and while the word is similar to <i>cafeteria</i> — and the two share a root word — a cafeteria tends to be a buffet-style restaurant or dining hall. <i>Cafe</i> comes from the French <i>café</i>, which means both "coffee" and "coffeehouse."</p></div></div>`;
