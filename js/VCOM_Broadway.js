If you like to perform in musicals, you might have dreams of one day making it to <i>Broadway.</i></p><p class="long">Broadway is New York's oldest street that runs north-south, and it's longer than you might think, stretching over 30 miles from the southernmost part of Manhattan all the way up to Sleepy Hollow, a small town in Westchester County. When people talk about Broadway, though, they almost always mean the theater district and the show business connected with it. Have you seen <i>Hamilton</i> in New York? If so, you can say you've been to a Broadway musical.</p></div></div>`;
