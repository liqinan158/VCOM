Your bike might be <i>crippled</i> by the broken front brake that won't let the wheel turn freely.</p><p class="long">You can used the adjective <i>crippled</i> to talk about a broken machine or a process that's not working the way it should. It was once commonly used to describe a physically disabled person, but this has become an offensive term and should be avoided. The word <i>crippled</i> comes from the Old English <i>crypel</i>, which is related to <i>cryppan</i>, "to crook or to bend."</p></div>`;
