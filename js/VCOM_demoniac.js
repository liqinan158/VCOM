var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">demoniac</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the adjective <i>demoniac</i> to describe something or someone who seems to be possessed by a demon, like the <i>demoniac</i> rantings of the actors portraying scary creatures at the haunted house.</p><p class="long">To pronounce <i>demoniac</i>, accent the second syllable: "de-MOE-nee-ac." The word has a somewhat confusing origin. The Latin word <i>daemon</i> means "spirit" and comes from the Greek word <i>daimon</i>, meaning "lesser god" or "guiding spirit." The Christian Greeks, however, translated it as "god of the heathen" and "unclean spirit." It is this negative connotation that is connected to <i>demoniac</i>: "like a demon."</p></div>`;
