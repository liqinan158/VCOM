If you purchase your concert tickets online instead of at the box office, you'll have to pay a five-dollar <i>surcharge</i>.</p><p class="long">Any added fee can be called a surcharge, whether it's the surcharge you pay for bringing an extra suitcase on an airplane or the surcharge a business pays every time a customer uses a credit card. As a verb, it means to charge someone an extra fee: "I'm changing banks because mine surcharges me every time I use my card at an ATM." In the 15th century, <i>surcharge</i> meant "overcharge" or "charge too much."</p></div></div>`;
