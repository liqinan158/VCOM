You can also use <i>caveman</i> to refer to any crude and uncivilized guy — like your older brother who tries to impress dates with his belching skills.</p><p class="long">"The Flintstones" is a perfect example of a cartoon caveman stereotype—the characters live with dinosaurs and wear animal hides as clothing. In reality, the early humans who lived in caves and left behind Paleolithic cave paintings existed at a completely different time than dinosaurs. And scholars believe that most humans during this period lived in simple tents or other temporary structures.</p></div>`;
