It's challenging to fit English into a classical version of hexameter, which follows specific rules about exactly what kinds of metric feet must be used and in what order. This form was much better suited to Greek and Latin. The word <i>hexameter</i> comes from the Greek <i>hexametros</i> and its roots, <i>hex</i>, "six," and <i>metron</i>, "poetic meter."</p></div>`;
