Stay away from both.</p><p class="long">Despite its name, poison ivy isn't a type of ivy, though it is a climbing plant that spreads quickly across the ground and climbs up trees and fences. Many animals can safely eat the leaves and berries of poison ivy, but the majority of people are severely allergic to it. If you hope to avoid poison ivy, remember the saying "Leaves of three, let it be," a reference to the plant's distinctive groups of three leaflets.</p></div></div>`;
