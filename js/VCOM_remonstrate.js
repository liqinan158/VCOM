If your mother yells at you in public, you might call this getting chewed out. She might call it <i>remonstrating</i>. Either way, it's embarrassing.</p><p class="long"><i>Remonstrate</i> has its roots in a Latin verb meaning "to show," and it used to mean "to make plain." Which is why <i>remonstrate</i> is a word that puts the glow of respectability on the action of yelling at someone or telling them that they're wrong. The sense is that the person remonstrating is the victim â€” they're just making the injustice plain.</p></div>`;
