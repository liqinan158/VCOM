Let your mail carrier deliver your credit card bill and the form letter from the “Save the Orchids” foundation, but trust a <i>courier</i> with your book contract or birth certificate.</p><p class="long"><i>Couriers</i> are in a hurry. Do they saunter up your driveway the way a mail carrier does? No! <i>Couriers</i> are clearly on important business; they’re jogging. The word comes from a Latin word, <i>currere</i>, meaning “to run.” Nowadays, you might see couriers on bicycles, however, weaving in and out of traffic to deliver your messages on time.</p></div></div>`;
