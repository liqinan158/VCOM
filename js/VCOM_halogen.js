The halogens are all highly reactive, which means they're quick to form bonds with other elements. What they often end up becoming is some kind of salt, including common table salt. In fact, the literal translation of <i>halogen</i> is "salt-producer," from Greek roots <i>hals</i>, "salt," and <i>gen</i>, "giving birth to."</p></div></div>`;
