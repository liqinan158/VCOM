A skit, flyer, or cartoon can be a <i>pasquinade</i> — as long as its intent is to mock or ridicule something or someone.</p><p class="long">You can find examples of modern <i>pasquinades</i> on late night television political sketches and in newspaper political cartoons that mercilessly make fun of public figures. Today, you’re probably more likely to use a synonym for <i>pasquinade</i>, such as <i>lampoon</i> or <i>satire</i>. But neither of those words can say they got their name from <i>Pasquino</i>, a 500 year-old statue in Rome where people posted lampoons and satirical poems.</p></div></div>`;
