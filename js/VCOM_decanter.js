Put it in a <i>decanter</i>, an elegant glass container with a stopper.</p><p class="long">A decanter is similar to a <i>carafe</i>, a wide-mouthed vessel for serving liquids, except it has a narrower neck and a stopper. Particularly ornate decanters are made of cut crystal and are meant to hold wine, which some people believe should "breathe" before being poured and sipped. <i>Decanter</i> comes from the verb <i>decant</i>, "to pour," and its Medieval Latin source, <i>decanthare</i>, "pour from the edge of a vessel."</p></div></div>`;
