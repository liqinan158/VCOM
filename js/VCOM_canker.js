Some people are prone to getting <i>cankers</i> on their mouths. <i>Canker</i> can also refer to anything that is terrible and difficult to get rid of. Your parents might complain that the abandoned, run-down house two blocks away is a <i>canker</i> on your neighborhood.</p><p class="long">In medicine, cankers are ulcers that are difficult to treat (the word is closely related to <i>cancer</i>). In agriculture, <i>canker</i> refers to a fungal disease that attacks the bark of trees. If one kid in your class misbehaves, and everyone suddenly follows his lead, that kid could be described (by your teachers) as a canker.</p></div>`;
