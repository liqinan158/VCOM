You run away fast. Don’t confuse <i>flee</i> with "flea." They sound alike, but the second kind is an insect whose bites make you itch.</p><p class="long">We get the word <i>flee</i> from Old English <i>fleon</i>. When you flee, you get away as quickly as you can. You might even take flight to escape — usually from a dangerous place or situation. In a moment of panic after stealing a cookie from the cookie jar, you might decide to flee the scene of the crime.</p></div>`;
