One way to <i>elevate</i> your mood is to exercise and <i>elevate</i> your heart rate. But if you exercise too hard and sprain your ankle, you might have to <i>elevate</i> it by propping it on a pillow.</p><p class="long">An elevator elevates you: it carries you to a higher floor in a building. Elevate can also mean to raise something to a higher intellectual level, as when an informed speaker elevates the level of debate about an issue. A boss can elevate, or promote, a worker to a better position. For example, a restaurant manager might elevate a superb busboy to the position of waiter. <i>Elevate</i> comes from Latin <i>elevates</i>, which means “to raise” or even "to lighten.”</p></div></div>`;
