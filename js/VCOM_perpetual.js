If you're a <i>perpetual</i> procrastinator, your dilly-dallying ways are never going to improve.</p><p class="long">It may be true that the only constant is change, but English nevertheless has no shortage of words to describe things that never change: <i>everlasting, eternal</i>, and <i>permanent</i>, for example — and this word, <i>perpetual</i>, from the Latin <i>perpetuus</i>, "continuous." In casual usage, though, you might hear someone say "This <i>perpetual</i> bad weather needs to clear." Maybe it should come as no surprise to find people using the word to describe things that are not truly everlasting — since so few things really are.</p></div>`;
