If you are a politician, your basic message should be <i>communicable</i> or communicated easily to others.</p><p class="long">Whether a cold or a message, think of transmitting something when using the word <i>communicable</i>. In this word, you might see <i>communicate</i>, <i>commune</i>, and <i>community</i>. All of these words come from the Latin root <i>communicare</i> which means "to share." When something is communicable it is easily shared with a community of people.</p></div>`;
