You might read about a <i>bipartisan</i> plan to improve the school system where you live.</p><p class="long">The word <i>bipartisan</i> is easy to figure out when you break it apart: <i>bi</i>-, meaning “two,” plus <i>partisan</i>, meaning "supporter of a party." So something that’s bipartisan involves two parties finding enough common ground to support the same thing. A key aspect of something that’s bipartisan is that the two parties involved typically hold opposing views about the best way to do things, so a bipartisan agreement is one that likely involved a lot of effort, compromise, and cooperation.</p></div>`;
