At some schools, being a senior might <i>entitle</i> students to go out for lunch on Fridays.</p><p class="long">The most common use of <i>entitle</i> is the one you might see on a coupon, like one for a free ride at the state fair that entitles the holder to one free ride on the Octopus of Terror. When you entitle someone, you give them a claim to something, like when you entitle someone the best goalie in Canada, or make someone a member of the noble class, like when the Queen entitles, or gives a title to, a worthy person.</p></div></div>`;
