While you can read <i>psalms</i> as prayers, they are meant to be sung.</p><p class="long">The Book of Psalms is a section of the Christian Old Testament and the Hebrew Bible that includes 150 individual psalms. The word <i>psalm</i>, which is pronounced with a silent <i>p</i>, comes from the Greek word <i>psalmos</i>, "song sung to a harp," and its root, <i>psallein</i>, "play a stringed instrument." While they're not often backed by a harp these days, psalms are frequently sung with musical accompaniment in churches and temples.</p></div></div>`;
