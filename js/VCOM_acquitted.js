If you're on trial for a crime and you're found "not guilty," then you're <i>acquitted</i> and you can go free.</p><p class="long">When you have been labeled <i>acquitted</i>, that means the jury has found you not guilty of the crime and legally blameless. The word gained notoriety in the highly publicized 1995 trial of the former football star O. J. Simpson, accused of murdering his wife and her friend.  Simpson’s attorney’s mantra to the jury was "If the glove doesn't fit, you must acquit," referring to a bloody glove connected to the murder.</p></div></div>`;
