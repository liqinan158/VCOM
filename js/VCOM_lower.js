When you go to sleep at night, you <i>lower</i> your head onto your pillow (unless you are a horse; in that case, you don't <i>lower</i> anything and sleep standing up).</p><p class="long">After cleaning your house's gutters, you'll climb down, lower the ladder, and put it away. After you've raised your hand in class and been called on, you will lower your hand again. Another way to <i>lower</i> something is to decrease the volume: "Will you please <i>lower</i> the sound on the TV? It's way too loud!" A less common meaning of <i>lower</i> is to scowl or glower, or to look stormy and dark.</p></div>`;
