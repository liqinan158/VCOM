At a birthday party, you might wear a <i>blindfold</i> and attempt to pin a paper tail on a picture of a donkey.</p><p class="long">A bank robber might blindfold a hostage, and a kindergarten teacher might also tie a blindfold on the birthday boy during a party game. In both cases, the blindfold makes the person unable to see what's going on. The earliest, 14th century version of the word was <i>blindfelled</i>, the past participle of <i>blindfellan</i>, "cover the eyes," from the Old English <i>blindfellian</i>, "to strike blind."</p></div>`;
