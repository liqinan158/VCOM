If you enter a singing contest and the judge says that your singing is like that of a toad with laryngitis, that is <i>scathing</i> criticism.</p><p class="long"><i>Scathing</i> comes from an old Norse verb, to <i>scathe</i>, which means to injure by fire or lightning. Now we use it when someoneâ€™s critique is so harsh that it feels like you've been burned. If your best friend turns against you and advertises your faults to the world, and you feel like everyone is staring and talking about you, you are having a scathing experience.</p></div>`;
