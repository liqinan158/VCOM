You might crave <i>solitude</i> after spending the holidays with your big, loud family — you want nothing more than to get away from everyone for a little while.</p><p class="long"><i>Solitude</i> can also refer to a place where you're completely alone. The middle of the woods, the top of a big mountain, the middle of a vast desert, even your room — these are places where you might go for solitude. <i>Solitude</i> comes from the Latin word <i>solitudinem</i>, which means "loneliness," but if you have moments of solitude that doesn't necessarily mean you're lonely. The word <i>solitude</i> carries the sense that you're enjoying being alone by choice.</p></div></div>`;
