Your <i>confidant</i> has all the dirt on you, so don't forget his birthday or he might start talking...</p><p class="long"><i>Confidants</i> are people you trust enough to tell anything, like that you cried during "The Muppet Movie." They might give advice, too. The President has lots of confidants in his inner circle who not only know all about secret government issues, but also give their opinions about what actions he should take. Make sure to spell the word with the <i>ant</i> ending, because <i>confident</i> means something else. Think of confiding in your <i>aunt</i>, your confidANT.</p></div>`;
