The government is always interested in dreaming up new sources of <i>revenue</i>, and so is the average head of a company unless she doesn't want to be the head anymore.</p><p class="long"><i>Revenue</i> is from a French word meaning "to return or come back," and dollar returns are always a welcome thing. Declining advertising revenue will doom your website, no matter how great it is. If your lemonade stand is not making a profit, you might consider lowering costs. Maybe you could get cheaper lemonade mix? Or you might look for more creative and exciting ways to increase <i>revenue</i>––like raiding the pantry for cookies you can sell as well.</p></div>`;
