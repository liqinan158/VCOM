If you've ever planted a small tree, you've probably uncovered its roots from their jute wrapping first, and if you've bought a five-pound bag of rice or sugar, it most likely came in a rough jute bag. <i>Jute</i> comes from the Bengali word <i>jhuto</i>, from the Sanskrit root <i>juta-s</i>, "twisted hair."</p></div>`;
