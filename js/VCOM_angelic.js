Hard to believe that two hours earlier they were spitting milk at the babysitter and stuffing peas up their nose.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>angelic</i> can describe anything related to angels or resembling an angel. It can refer to actual angels, as in an angelic choir, which is a bunch of singing angels. Or it can be used to describe someone or something that has the sweet and gentle qualities of an angel. If a choir sounds angelic, it’s a normal choir of people but their voices are so pure and beautiful that they sound like angels.</p></div>`;
