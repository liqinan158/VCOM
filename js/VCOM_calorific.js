A motorcycle race can be <i>calorific</i> in at least two ways: The engines get burning hot, and watching the race can make you burn with excitement.</p><p class="long">In today's diet-obsessed world, you'd be forgiven for thinking that <i>calorific</i> means "filled with calories." In fact, when you do something calorific you don't load up on calories; you get rid of them. Say you drink a bottle of soda and then jump on the treadmill.  All those calories you just poured down your throat? You're burning them up, turning them into heat.  Running is a calorific activity. And a sweaty one.</p></div></div>`;
