Because it's designed to go far, it gained the name <i>flyer</i>.</p><p class="long">As far back as the 15th Century, Middle English used the word <i>flyer</i> to refer to something that travels quickly through the air, generally a bird or projectile.  The connection with a person came about later, when air travel became more common.  If you are a frequent flyer, you travel a lot.  If you frequently post flyers, maybe you're in a band.  Note: it doesn't matter if you spell the word <i>flyer</i> or "flier," as both are correct, but don't use both in one piece of writing.</p></div>`;
