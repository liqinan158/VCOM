Poor Hester Prynne who was forced to wear a red "A" on her chest for "adultery" knows all about <i>obloquy</i>.</p><p class="long">If you break the word <i>obloquy</i> into its two Latin roots, you have <i>ob</i>, meaning “against” and <i>loqui</i>, meaning "to speak" — so <i>obloquy</i> means “to speak against," in an especially mean way. <i>Obloquy</i> can also be the result of public shame, or criticism. Sometimes obloquy takes the form of offensive or rude language: "It's not easy, but I've found it's best to ignore my sister's <i>obloquy</i> when I beat her in Monopoly."</p></div></div>`;
