New parents often stagger through their days in <i>somnolence</i>, after spending their nights up with a baby who only sleeps for a few hours at a time.</p><p class="long">Use the noun <i>somnolence</i> when you're talking about drowsiness. You might be overcome with somnolence in a boring class, especially if you didn't get much sleep the night before. Also, someone who seems to be out of it, going through life like a sleepwalker can be described as experiencing somnolence, which comes from the Latin word <i>somnolentia</i>, sleepiness.</p></div></div>`;
