Even though you may feel emotionally committed to your mate, you need to legally tie the know to be considered <i>married</i>.</p><p class="long">A married couple has made an official, legal agreement to be partners. If your many brothers and sisters are all married, it means you have a lot of sisters- and brothers-in-law (the spouses of your siblings). You can also use <i>married</i> to describe things that have something to do with marriage: "Those two are the picture of <i>married</i> bliss." The Latin root of <i>married</i> is <i>maritare</i>, "to wed or to marry."</p></div></div>`;
