It's normal for a new rescue dog to be <i>guarded</i> when you first bring her home.</p><p class="long">People tend to be guarded in certain situations â€” when they're being criticized, or are at a party where they don't know a single person. Others simply have guarded personalities, always starting from a position of cautiousness. <i>Guarded</i> can also literally mean "protected," like a guarded castle, but you'll more often find it describing a restrained person.</p></div></div>`;
