If you follow a <i>diagram</i> for assembling bunk beds and finish with parts left over, you should ask for the top bunk, not the bottom one.</p><p class="long"><i>Diagram</i> goes back to the Greek verb <i>diagraphein</i>, meaning "to mark out by lines," and a diagram uses line drawings to explain something. Electronic equipment comes with a long instruction booklet and a one-page diagram, and it's usually the diagram that helps most in connecting the device. A diagram can also be a complex drawing, like an engineering plan for airplanes. When you make a line drawing of your own, you can use <i>diagram</i> as a verb, as when you diagram a sentence.</p></div>`;
