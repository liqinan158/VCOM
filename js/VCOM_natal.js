You can also use <i>natal</i> for things that occur at the same time as a birth, like the position of the stars on that day or the town in which a child is born â€” her natal city. In the fourteenth century, <i>natal</i> meant "pertaining to birthdays," from the Latin word <i>natus</i>, "to be born."</p></div></div>`;
