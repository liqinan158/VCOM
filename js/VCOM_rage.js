Some frustrated drivers let their emotions boil over into <i>road rage</i> when another car cuts them off, for example.</p><p class="long">If you're full of rage, you're full of anger — powerful, extreme, sometimes even violent anger. <i>Rage</i> can also be a verb: you might rage against something you hate or as the poet Dylan Thomas pleaded, "Rage, rage against the dying of the light." Things that rage are out of control, like a raging, roaring fire or a wild storm. Another meaning involves the latest, greatest trend — you'd say it's "all the rage."</p></div></div>`;
