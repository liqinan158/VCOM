The bathroom door sticks sometimes, but if you <i>joggle</i> the handle it'll open!</p><p class="long">From its sound, you'd think that <i>joggle</i> is a combination of "jiggle" and "jog," but it actually predates <i>jiggle</i> by more than 300 years. When you joggle a baby on your lap, you bounce it gently, and if you find yourself nervously joggling your foot during an interview, you're shaking it. As a noun, <i>joggle</i> has an entirely different meaning: it's a kind of dowel or tooth used to hold bricks or stones together in a wall.</p></div></div>`;
