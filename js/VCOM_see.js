However, this word has loads of meanings: you can <i>see</i> a shrink, which means you're consulting a psychiatrist; or you can be <i>seeing</i> your high school sweetheart, which means you're dating him.</p><p class="long"><i>See</i> usually means passively observing, while <i>look</i>, which is also something you do with your eyes, is more active and intentional. When someone says, "The president will <i>see</i> you now," the president is sitting there passively, waiting for you to be shown in. You can say "I <i>see</i>," to mean "I understand; I get it." Or you can look into your crystal ball and see into the future, in which case you'd be called a seer.</p></div>`;
