That's a <i>rainbow</i>.</p><p class="long">The scientific explanation for a rainbow's appearance is that light is refracted in water droplets, briefly revealing the full visible spectrum of light â€” all of the colors that make it up. While there are actually about a hundred colors in the visible spectrum, we tend to describe a rainbow as having six or seven. In Old English, there were two words for this phenomenon: <i>scurboga</i>, or "shower-bow," proved to be less popular than <i>renboga</i>, "rain bow."</p></div>`;
