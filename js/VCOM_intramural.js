Your local recreational center might offer <i>intramural</i> table tennis to its members.</p><p class="long">First used in the mid-19th century, the adjective <i>intramural</i> comes from the prefix <i>intra</i>, meaning "within," and the Latin word <i>murus</i>, meaning "walls." It describes an activity that is done within the boundaries — the walls — of an organization or community. You might be familiar with intramural sports leagues that are intended for recreation and fun.
