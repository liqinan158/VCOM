A spoiled child typically whines for something and gets it, becoming used to that kind of over-indulgent treatment. Spoiled milk smells terrible and tastes even worse. This adjective comes from the verb <i>spoil</i>, meaning "ruin" or "destroy"; the idea was that giving in to a child's every whim would ruin him.</p></div></div>`;
