var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">transpiration</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Plants breathe through their stomata, little openings that allow <i>transpiration</i>, which is the outward passage of water vapor along with carbon dioxide. This vapor then evaporates into the air as part of the process of photosynthesis.</p><p class="long">We can see the history of the word <i>transpiration</i> when we break it down into <i>trans</i>, a Latin noun which means "across," and <i>spiration</i>, which comes from the Latin verb <i>spīrāre</i>, meaning "to breathe." The <i>tion</i> suffix adds the meaning "the act of," so we can see <i>transpiration</i> is, literally, "the act of breathing across," which clearly identifies vapor emission from plant leaves.  Transpiration is vital to the earth’s ecology, and is being reduced by our decimation of the forests.</p></div>`;
