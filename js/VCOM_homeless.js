Refugees living in temporary camps because of civil war are <i>homeless</i>.</p><p class="long">Homeless refugees aren't really citizens of any land, while other homeless people are in a more temporary bad spot, having lost their homes because of financial trouble, illness, or other bad luck. Sometimes the word <i>homeless</i> is used as a noun for a person in such a predicament, but it's more correct and thoughtful to use the word as an adjective — that way, a homeless person isn't solely defined by not having a home.</p></div></div>`;
