Your grandparents might complain that the biggest problem with the internet is that there's just no <i>politesse</i> at all.</p><p class="long">Some other ways to say <i>politesse</i> are "courtesy" or "civility." It's a slightly fancy way to talk about treating other people politely and kindly. As you might guess, <i>politesse</i> shares a root with <i>polite</i>, the Latin <i>politus</i>, which means "refined" or "elegant." Especially in formal or solemn situations, it's important to treat others with politesse.</p></div></div>`;
