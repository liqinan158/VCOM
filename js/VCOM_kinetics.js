An astronomer investigating <i>kinetics</i> might be interested in the precise way the planets move.</p><p class="long">Physical kinetics is also known as <i>dynamics</i>, and its primary concern is the way bodies move when forces (such as gravity) are acting on them. In chemistry and biochemistry, kinetics is all about reaction rates. A chemist focused on kinetics studies the rate of various chemical reactions under varying conditions. The term <i>kinetics</i> stems from the Greek <i>kinetikos</i>, "putting in motion."</p></div>`;
