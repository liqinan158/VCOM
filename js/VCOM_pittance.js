The restaurant may pay you a <i>pittance</i>, but you can do well if you get a lot of good tips.</p><p class="long">The word <i>pittance</i> came into English from the Old French word <i>pitance</i>, meaning “allowance of food to a monk or poor person,” which in turn came from the Latin word <i>pietas</i>, meaning “pity.” Although a pittance may have originally meant that you were taking pity on someone with less wealth by giving them money or food, these days when you get a pittance it means that you earn a pitiful wage.</p></div>`;
