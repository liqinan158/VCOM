A student who loves <i>trigonometry</i> may have a career as a mathematician in her future, or as a musician specializing in playing the triangle (just kidding).</p><p class="long">When you take a trigonometry class, you'll spend a lot of time learning about the sides and angles of triangles and the functions and relationships of their measurements. You'll memorize many formulas and encounter words like <i>sine</i> and <i>cosine</i> as well. The noun <i>trigonometry</i> has been around for hundreds of years, ever since a sixteenth century mathematician coined it, from the Greek <i>trigonon</i>, "triangle" and <i>metron</i>, "a measure."</p></div></div>`;
