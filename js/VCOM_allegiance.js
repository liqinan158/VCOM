Either way you're expressing your commitment and devotion in the firmest sense of the word. The <i>liege</i> in <i>allegiance</i> comes from the Old French word meaning "lord and master," which is who you would have been swearing your allegiance to if you'd been a servant in France centuries ago.</p></div></div>`;
