His character was a "terminator," in a movie of the same name, and his goal was the termination of Sarah Connor. Lucky for Sarah, and the supposed future of our planet, the termination was unsuccessful. In the real world, you're more likely to see the word <i>termination</i> used when a contract, program, or job comes to an end, unexpectedly or as planned.</p></div>`;
