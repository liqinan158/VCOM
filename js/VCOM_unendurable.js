The vintage camper your parents bought might smell so terrible that it's <i>unendurable</i>.</p><p class="long">Use the adjective <i>unendurable</i> to describe situations that are truly impossible to bear, like the unendurable pain of losing a beloved friend. You can also use the word to emphasize the negative qualities of something: "This math class is <i>unendurable</i> â€” I'm transferring to modern dance." When you can <i>endure</i> something, you can stand it, even if it's hard. <i>Endure</i> comes from the Latin <i>indurare</i>, "make hard" or "harden the heart against."</p></div>`;
