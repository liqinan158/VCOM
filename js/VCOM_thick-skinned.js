var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">thick-skinned</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To be <i>thick-skinned</i> is to not be bothered by criticism and rejection. When you're <i>thick-skinned</i>, you're mentally tough.</p><p class="long">It can help you to remember the meaning of this term if you think about it literally. Someone with thick, tough, rough skin isn't going to be hurt by a little pinch or paper cut, unlike someone with thin skin. So thick-skinned people are also unaffected by less physical harms, like being criticized, rejected, or turned down. If you're thick-skinned, you don't let failure or disappointment get you down: you keep believing in yourself and moving forward.</p></div></div>`;
