In other words, it's something you probably don't want to get stuck in.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>morass</i> comes from the Dutch word <i>moeras,</i> meaning "marsh" or "fen." More metaphorically, just like its synonyms <i>mire</i> and <i>quagmire,</i> <i>morass</i> refers to anything that bogs you down, overwhelms you, and hinders your progress â€” like red tape, for example. You might refer to a "political <i>morass</i>" when the government cannot seem to pass legislation. Whether a morass is physical or metaphorical, it's a sticky mess you'll most likely want to avoid.</p></div></div>`;
