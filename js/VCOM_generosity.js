Someone showing <i>generosity</i> is happy to give time, money, food, or kindness to people in need.</p><p class="long"><i>Generosity</i> is a quality — like honesty and patience — that we all probably wish we had more of. When you show generosity, you might give away things or money or put others before yourself.  But generosity is about more than cash and stuff. When you're forgiving and gentle to people, you show generosity of spirit. If you give others help or credit, that shows generosity. The world would certainly be a better place if more people showed generosity to others.</p></div>`;
