Use <i>contumely</i> when you need an impressive (if obscure) way to say "contemptuous language" or "offensive behavior." You might stop a bully in his tracks by shouting, "I don't have to put up with this contumely!" Experts believe this word comes from the Latin <i>contumax</i>, "haughty or insolent."</p></div></div>`;
