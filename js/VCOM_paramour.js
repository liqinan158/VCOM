var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">paramour</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>paramour</i> is a lover, and often a secret one you're not married to. So it's best not to kiss and make eyes at your <i>paramour</i> in public, unless you want to be the center of a lot of gossip.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>paramour</i> evolved from the French phrase <i>par amour</i>, meaning “passionately” or “with desire.” If you break it down, you get <i>par</i>, meaning "by," and <i>amour</i>, the French word for love. Once upon a time, women used this word to describe Christ, and men would use it to refer to the Virgin Mary. But eventually, <i>paramour</i> shed its religious connotations and came to mean “darling” or “sweetheart,” and later “mistress” or “clandestine lover.”</p></div>`;
