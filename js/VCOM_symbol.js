A flag is a <i>symbol</i> of a country. English teachers never tire of talking about <i>symbols</i> in literature.</p><p class="long">A pink ribbon is a symbol of breast-cancer awareness, and a yellow ribbon is a symbol of support for U.S. troops. In literature, authors use many symbols. A character doing even a small thing, like eating a cheeseburger, might symbolize something larger about that character. Something you need to be rich to have — like a limousine — is called a "status <i>symbol</i>." Anytime one thing seems to represent a deeper meaning, it's probably a symbol.</p></div></div>`;
