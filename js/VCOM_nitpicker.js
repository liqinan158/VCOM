After seeing a movie, a <i>nitpicker</i> lists every tiny thing he or she didn't like about it.</p><p class="long">Use the informal <i>nitpicker</i> when you're talking about someone who is extremely critical, even when those criticisms seem inconsequential. If you can always find something to complain about, you're probably a nitpicker. This word, from about 1950, comes from the idea of literally picking nits (or lice eggs) out of someone's hair â€” a nitpicker is as careful and meticulous about finding faults as a literal nitpicker would be about finding each tiny nit.</p></div>`;
