A line of cars moving together to a cemetery is a funeral procession, and a bunch of parents pushing babies in strollers in a parade are also a procession. Another meaning of <i>procession</i> is any line or succession of people moving continuously, like a procession of local politicians knocking on your door one afternoon.
