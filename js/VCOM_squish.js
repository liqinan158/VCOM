If your sneakers get wet in the rain, you'll have to <i>squish</i> down the street.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>squish</i> is perfect for describing a walk through any muddy or wet situation. People squish through puddles and in soggy shoes. You can also refer to the sound itself as a <i>squish</i>: "The <i>squish</i> of your boots in the hall told me it must have started raining again." <i>Squish</i> is imitative â€” in other words, it sounds exactly like its meaning. It's thought to be a variation on <i>squash</i> and influenced by the obsolete word <i>squiss</i>, "to squeeze or crush."</p></div></div>`;
