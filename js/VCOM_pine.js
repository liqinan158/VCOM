If you're texting your ex-boyfriend over 50 times a day, there's a pretty good chance that you still <i>pine</i> for him.</p><p class="long">In Old English, <i>pine</i> meant "to torture or cause to experience pain," which seems quite fitting if you've known what it's like to pine for something or someone. The verb <i>pine</i> should not be confused with the noun <i>pine</i>, as in the evergreen tree. If you are from the Northeast and find yourself living in the Caribbean, you may pine for the sight of a pine tree, but the lovely weather should ease the pain.</p></div></div>`;
