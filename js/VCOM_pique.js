But when something <i>piques</i> your interest or curiosity, here the verb <i>pique</i> just means to arouse, stimulate, or excite.</p><p class="long">Both the noun and verb are pronounced "pÄ“k" and were borrowed from a French word meaning "a prick or irritation," from Old French <i>piquer</i>, "to prick." So you can see how something that piques you could make you both excited and angry, perhaps even enough to storm away. That storming away, by the by, might be called a "fit of pique."</p></div>`;
