Your <i>barber</i> might have a tendency to cut your hair a little shorter than you like.</p><p class="long">When you visit a barbershop, you sit in a special chair while the barber cuts your hair with scissors or electric clippers. Men are the most common customers of a barber, although women can also get their hair cut by barbers. <i>Barber</i> comes from the Anglo-French word <i>barbour</i>, which is rooted in the Latin word for "beard," <i>barb</i>. Early barbers were certified not only to cut hair, but to perform surgery and dentistry as well.</p></div></div>`;
