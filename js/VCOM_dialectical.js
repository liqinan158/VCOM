If you're an investigative journalist, you probably use <i>dialectical</i> reasoning.</p><p class="long">You might think <i>dialectical</i> refers to how people speak in a certain region or in a specific group, such as a regional accent. That version of <i>dialect</i> comes from the Greek word <i>dialektos</i>, meaning "discourse, way of speaking." But <i>dialectical</i> instead comes from the French word <i>dialecte</i>, meaning "denoting the art of investigating the truth of opinions." It has to do with a method of reasoning used to determine the truth.</p></div>`;
