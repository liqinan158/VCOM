It happens totally by chance, like the <i>random</i> picking of lottery numbers or unplanned <i>random</i> acts of kindness.</p><p class="long">Sometime in the 1980s, teenage slang hijacked the adjective <i>random</i> and tried to turn it into a word meaning weird, odd or out of place. As in "Dude! That guy wearing purple spandex at the party was so random!"  But don't fall for it. Something that’s truly <i>random</i> is totally governed by chance and has no specific pattern, like choosing a card at random from a magician’s deck.</p></div>`;
