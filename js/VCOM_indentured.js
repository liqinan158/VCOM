It started out as a word for a contract between masters and apprentices. Now it describes anyone bound to work, like it or not, because of some deal.</p><p class="long">Use the adjective <i>indentured</i> to describe someone who's bound or attached in a legal sense. If you're an indentured plumber's apprentice, you have guaranteed that you'll do that job in a particular way, for a specific length of time. If you're indentured to your grandmother, you may have promised to feed her cat every day for a month. When the word is used in this casual way, it implies a sense of duty that's become a burden.</p></div></div>`;
