A TV news station might play dramatic <i>footage</i> of a tornado's aftermath.</p><p class="long">A film clip or a scene from a movie in production are both <i>footage</i>. Part of a film editor's job is combining all the best footage into a longer piece. Another kind of <i>footage</i> is a way to measure space â€” when you're selling a house, you'll need to advertise its size, or square footage. The film meaning dates from 1916, from <i>foot</i> as a unit of measurement, in this case of a length of film.</p></div>`;
