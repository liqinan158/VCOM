You probably won't <i>rollick</i> during quiet reading time at school, but you'll have a chance to <i>rollick</i> at your best friend's roller disco party.</p><p class="long">People rollick during parties and dances, while they play active games, and even when they're watching hilariously funny movies. You can also say <i>cavort</i>, <i>revel</i>, or <i>frolic</i>â€”and experts guess that <i>rollick</i> comes from a combination of the words <i>frolic</i> and <i>roll</i>. The adjective <i>rollicking</i> is more common than the verb, and predates it by about 15 years.</p></div></div>`;
