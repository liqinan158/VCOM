In modern usage, any good source of information can be called an <i>oracle</i>.</p><p class="long">In his <i>Apology</i>, Plato claims that the oracle at Delphi played a vital role in the career of the philosopher Socrates, and a Delphic prophecy sets the tragedy of Sophocles' <i>Oedipus Rex</i> in motion. The word <i>oracle</i> can also be used to describe the utterances of a seer or anyone else who is pretty darn good at predicting the future.</p></div>`;
