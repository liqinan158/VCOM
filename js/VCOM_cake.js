You might prefer denser, richer cheesecakes or tiny, delicate cupcakes, or even a savory version made of potatoes and vegetables. If someone says, "Well, that takes the <i>cake</i>," they're expressing their surprise at something, and if you say, "That exam was a piece of <i>cake</i>," it as easy as eating a piece of cake.</p></div>`;
