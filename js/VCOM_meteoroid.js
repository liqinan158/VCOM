Space is full of <i>meteoroids</i>.</p><p class="long">Most meteoroids are small, the size of pebbles or dust from a comet’s tail, but they can also be quite large. They’re all chunks off of something bigger, sometimes even the moon or Mars! If a meteoroid enters the Earth’s atmosphere, it’s called a meteor, or shooting star. If part of that meteor survives the trip through the atmosphere and hits the Earth, it’s a meteorite. A lot of meteoroids never end up being meteors or meteorites.</p></div></div>`;
