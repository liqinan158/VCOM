Things that can have complexity include: the events leading up to the American Civil War, a broth made with many ingredients, your relationship with your parents. <i>Complexity</i> is the opposite of simplicity. When something has a lot of complexity, you say it is complex. When it has very little complexity, it is simple.</p></div>`;
