Being a <i>slowpoke</i> is a real disadvantage when you're running in a 50 yard dash.</p><p class="long">The informal <i>slowpoke</i> is a good one to use when your little brother is lagging behind, slowing everyone down: "Hurry up, <i>slowpoke</i>!" In the UK, the equivalent word is <i>slowcoach</i>, which makes sense if you think of a stagecoach moving slowly. The <i>poke</i> part of <i>slowpoke</i> comes from a rare meaning, "a device attached to pigs and sheep to keep them from escaping," and is also the root of <i>pokey</i>, or "slow."</p></div>`;
