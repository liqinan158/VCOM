If three women with the same name sit at a table, one of them will be married within the year. Believe it or not, thatâ€™s <i>onomancy</i>.</p><p class="long">The belief in a connection between luck and a person's name is an old one. During the heyday of onomancy, a fortune teller might ascribe meaning to the number of vowels in your name or the total number of letters. It was also common to give each letter a number value, and to add up the total number of a person's name. <i>Onomancy</i> comes from the Greek <i>onoma</i>, "name," and <i>manteia</i>, "prophecy."</p></div></div>`;
