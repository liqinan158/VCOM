Some school dress codes mandate wearing a uniform, while others specify shorts or skirts of certain lengths or prohibit controversial "statement" t-shirts. A fancy restaurant's dress code might require men to wear jackets and ties. And the dress code for your little sister's tea party might include feather boas and sparkly tiaras.</p></div>`;
