Many things in life benefit from being prearranged: spies need to prearrange meeting places and code words, and new parents usually prearrange gear like car seats and diapers before the birth of their child. <i>Prearrange</i> adds the "before" prefix <i>pre-</i> to <i>arrange</i>, from the Old French <i>a</i>, "to," and <i>rangier</i>, "set in a row."</p></div></div>`;
