It is a derogatory label affixed most often to people who are not forthcoming romantically — and it's not very nice.</p><p class="long">To be prude is to be prudent, or careful. That’s not a bad thing, but <i>prude</i> is usually an insult. A prude might gasp when someone says a bad word. <i>Prude</i> was borrowed from French, short for <i>prude femme</i> "wise and good woman." Though the word took on a negative meaning, Old French <i>prud</i> also meant "capable or brave" and is probably the source of English <i>proud</i>.</p></div></div>`;
