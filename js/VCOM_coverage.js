If your history book's <i>coverage</i> of the Civil War is skimpy, you might want to do some extra research at the library.</p><p class="long">There's the TV news coverage of the winter Olympics — in other words, the way they show and comment on the events — and the spotty coverage of your lawn by the grass you planted. Something is covered in both examples, either literally or figuratively, and it's more common to use <i>coverage</i> in a figurative way. There's also insurance coverage, or the extent of protection it provides: "I have the cheapest car insurance <i>coverage</i>, so it won't pay to fix these dents."</p></div>`;
