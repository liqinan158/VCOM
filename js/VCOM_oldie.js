Many radio stations specialize in playing "the golden <i>oldies</i>" — songs like "Poison Ivy" or "Shake Yo' Bootie."</p><p class="long">As time goes on, more and more highlights of popular culture become oldies — in the 1970s, people listened to oldies from the 50s, but today there are just as many classic radio oldies from the 70s and even 80s. You can also watch oldies on television — old shows in black and white like "Father Knows Best," or with obvious, dated laugh tracks, like "Gilligan's Island."</p></div>`;
