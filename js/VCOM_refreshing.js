The offer of a <i>refreshing</i> glass of iced tea would be especially <i>refreshing</i> if it came from your normally cranky sister.</p><p class="long">Mint toothpaste is refreshing — clean and brisk — and a cool ocean breeze is refreshing on a hot day. If you're used to seeing wilted salads and pale lasagna in your school cafeteria every day, a refreshing change would be a taco bar or homemade pizza. <i>Refreshing</i> comes from the verb <i>refresh</i>, which has a Germanic root similar to <i>frisc</i>, "fresh" in Old High German.</p></div></div>`;
