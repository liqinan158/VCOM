For example, a <i>keynote</i> speaker at a conference includes this central subject in her speech.</p><p class="long">You're most likely to find the word <i>keynote</i> followed by "speech," "address," or "speaker." The central keynote theme is often presented right at the beginning of a conference or seminar. Another meaning of <i>keynote</i> is "the leading note in a musical key." When you play a scale on the piano, the first, lowest, note is the keynote. This musical meaning dates from the mid-1700s, and the phrase "<i>keynote</i> address" was first used in 1905.</p></div>`;
