If you're looking at kittens, you may see solid black ones, solid white, or ones with lots of different patches of color. You'd call a patchy one <i>pied</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Pied</i> was first used to refer to magpiesâ€™ black and white plumage. Later, <i>pied</i> came to refer to an order of friars known for their black and white robes, and even later, <i>pied</i> came to refer to a jumble of typefaces in a printed document. Now, <i>pied</i> can indicate anything having two or more colors. Someone with multicolored articles of clothing can be said to be pied, as in the Pied Piper of Hamlin.</p></div>`;
