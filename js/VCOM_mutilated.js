After a disaster, it can sometimes be hard to identify the <i>mutilated</i> bodies.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>mutilated</i> is a gory word that's good for describing maimed or injured bodies. When something's mutilated, it's often harmed in such a way that it's no longer recognizable. A mutilated face might be cut so badly that you can't identify who it belongs to, and a mutilated arm could be crushed so terribly that it no longer looks like an arm. The Latin root <i>mutilare</i> literally means "with a part cut off."</p></div>`;
