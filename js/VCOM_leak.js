It can be a behind-someone’s-back <i>leak</i> of sensitive information, a <i>leak</i> from a milk carton, or a <i>leak</i> in the roof that lets rain water drip in.</p><p class="long">As a verb, <i>leak</i> means to allow light or fluid to escape, or to enter or escape as though through a hole. Light can leak in through the curtains, water can leak out of an almost-closed faucet, or information can leak to the press. A leak is almost always a bad thing — it indicates that something that should be contained has broken out or escaped.</p></div></div>`;
