var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">dystopia</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>dystopia</i> is a fictional world where people live under a highly controlled, totalitarian system. In his novel "Brave New World," Aldous Huxley created a <i>dystopia</i> where individual identity is suppressed and families no longer exist. Yep, it’s pretty scary.</p><p class="long">The word <i>dystopia</i> comes from adding the Latin prefix <i>dys</i>, which means “bad,” to the word <i>utopia</i>. So a dystopia is a utopia gone wrong. While the intention might have been to create a perfect society, all the regulations make life there really bad. Often a dystopia in a book is a society of the future, serving as a warning about what might happen if we let technology, industry, and government creep further and further into our lives.</p></div>`;
