Your expression softens and your mouth turns up at the corners.</p><p class="long"><i>Smile</i>, noun or verb, with its universal message and association with enjoyment and pleasure, is a very useful word. It can express joy or even say hello. Of course if you “<i>smile</i> through your sorrows,” you are either tying to make yourself feel better or fool other people into thinking you are happy. But in general, a smile is a good sign. And as the song goes “You’re never fully dressed without a <i>smile</i>.”</p></div>`;
