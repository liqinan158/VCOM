It may be more common to have a <i>soft spot</i> for puppies, but it's fine if your <i>soft spot</i> is for stingrays.</p><p class="long">A slightly different kind of soft spot is a vulnerability or weakness, especially something that an opponent might take advantage of. And a baby's soft spot has another meaning altogetherâ€”it's the vulnerable area on top of her tiny head, where the skull hasn't yet grown together, also known as the <i>fontanelle</i>. This soft spot allows the brain of a baby human to continue growing after birth.</p></div>`;
