Some <i>islands</i> are so small that a beach chair and umbrella barely fit on them and some are big enough to contain a whole nation.</p><p class="long">To get to an island you must take a boat, bridge or airplane — be a strong swimmer. If you can get there by land it’s not an island, though it may be a peninsula, like Florida. There are many famous islands, like Manhattan and the islands of Hawaii. Things that are free-standing can also be called islands, like the island made of cabinets and a counter that is found in some kitchens — it's not connected to anything else.</p></div></div>`;
