That stick on her shoulders is a <i>yoke</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Yoke</i> also can mean the stick that connects two work animals together, or the act of connecting two things together as with a yoke. A classic tool of farmers for centuries, the yoke has also become a symbol of oppression â€” no one wants to live under the yoke of a tyrant's rule. Do not confuse <i>yoke</i> with yolk, the yellow part of an egg.</p></div>`;
