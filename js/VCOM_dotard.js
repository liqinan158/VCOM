A <i>dotard</i> is a person who's old and senile.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>dotard</i> used to be a standard way to insult someone by implying that they were physically and mentally decrepit. Shakespeare, Chaucer, and J.R.R. Tolkien all used it regularly as a put-down between characters. <i>Dotard</i> is much less common these days. It comes from the Middle Low German <i>doten</i>, "be foolish," and when correctly pronounced, it rhymes with <i>goatherd</i>.</p></div></div>`;
