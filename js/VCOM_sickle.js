Put a hammer next to a <i>sickle</i> and boom, thereâ€™s the symbol for communism.</p><p class="long">Farmers use sickles to clear brush or cut grain crops by hand. In some parts of the world, sickles are also used as weapons and for cooking. The sickle often represents an agricultural working class, notably in the crossed hammer and sickle symbol of the former Soviet Union and current Communist and Socialist parties around the world. <i>Sickle</i> comes from a Proto-Indo-European root meaning "to cut."</p></div>`;
