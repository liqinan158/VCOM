Parents, teachers, and cops all appreciate <i>obedience</i>.</p><p class="long">If you have a dog, you might have taken it to obedience school. Trainers help teach dogs obedience â€” obeying commands and showing good behavior. For a dog, obedience consists of things like shaking and lying down on command, coming when called, and going to the bathroom outside. People demonstrate obedience when they follow the law, and kids show obedience when they obey their parents and teachers. Obedience is respectful.</p></div></div>`;
