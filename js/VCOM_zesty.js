When you eat a zesty lunch, it's highly flavored or even spicy. If you give her the extra hot salsa, your mom might say, "Ooh, these enchiladas are <i>zesty</i>!" The adjective comes from <i>zest</i>, the word for the outer part of an orange or lemon peel, which is often added to recipes for extra flavor.</p></div></div>`;
