It is related to the Greek words <i>kakos</i>, meaning "bad, evil," and <i>phone</i>, or "voice." You may feel like you're facing something evil if youâ€™re bombarded by the <i>cacophonous</i> sounds of, say, political pundits yelling at one another, or the chaotic sounds of traffic and voices on a busy urban street. <i>Cacophonous</i> is the opposite of <i>harmonious</i>.</p></div>`;
