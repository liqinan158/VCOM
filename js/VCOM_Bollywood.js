The city of Bombay, which is known as Mumbai today, is where the Hindi-language Indian film industry is based â€” in other words, it's the Hollywood of India. More movies are produced in India than any other country in the world, and Bollywood movies tend to be extravaganzas, lasting three or more hours and including fabulous costumes, locations, dancing, and music.</p></div>`;
