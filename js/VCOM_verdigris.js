A lot of churches have rooftops coated with <i>verdigris</i>, and many capitol buildings have <i>verdigris</i> on their domes.</p><p class="long">Bronze, brass, and copper metals get verdigris because of exposure to air and wetness, especially saltwater.  The Old French origin of <i>verdigris</i> literally translates to “green of Greece,” which can help you remember how to pronounce the word: VURR-de-Greece. The word is a noun that refers to the actual layer of green pigment that coats a surface. It’s a handsome color, and many painters use verdigris when they want a sea-foam look.</p></div>`;
