var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">ragtag</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>ragtag</i> is a disorganized or motley group of people. When a parade marching band is described as a <i>ragtag</i>, it probably has mismatched outfits and an odd collection of instruments.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>ragtag</i> comes from the old-fashioned phrase <i>rag, tag, and bobtail</i> â€” <i>bobtail</i> was once slang for "contemptible rascal," while <i>tag</i> was used to mean "torn cloth." Together, the phrase meant "riffraff" or "an unsavory bunch of folks." Today, you're more likely to see <i>ragtag</i> used as an adjective, as it is in the musical "Hamilton," in which the Continental Army is described as "a <i>ragtag</i> volunteer army in need of a shower."</p></div>`;
