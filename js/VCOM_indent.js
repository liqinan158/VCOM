When you're writing an essay, you can <i>indent</i> the first sentence of each paragraph.</p><p class="long">There are different styles of arranging type on a page, but it's fairly common to indent the beginning of a paragraph or section, which you can do with the tab key on a keyboard. Another way to <i>indent</i> is to cause a hollow, depression, or notch â€” in other words, to dent. This meaning is closest to the original, "to notch or give a serrated edge to," from Medieval Latin, <i>indentare</i>, "furnish with teeth."</p></div>`;
