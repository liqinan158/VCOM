When you're talking to your friend who's prone to exaggeration, it's hard to tell what's <i>veridical</i> and what's just made up.</p><p class="long">Using the adjective <i>veridical</i> is a formal way to describe things that are accurate or based in reality. Sworn testimony in a courtroom is expected to be veridical, as is the information you learn in a history class in school. Sometimes predictions or dreams that appear to foretell the future are also described as veridical. The Latin root word <i>veridicus</i> merges <i>verus</i> "true" with <i>dicere</i> "to speak."</p></div>`;
