When you revise something, this is exactly what happens. A revised opinion has been thought over and changed, and a revised edition of a newspaper or online news story has been edited, its inaccuracies fixed, and re-published. <i>Revised</i> usually implies that something has been improved or modernized as well.</p></div></div>`;
