If a teacher assigns a ten-page paper due the next day, the students would be in agreement that the assignment was unfair. A written or verbal contract can also be called an <i>agreement</i>. An agreement to deliver an article a month for a publication could not be broken simply because you have writer's block.</p></div>`;
