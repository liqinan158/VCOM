Think of <i>exacerbate</i> then as a sharp or bitter thing that makes something worse. A drought will exacerbate a country's food shortage. <i>Worsen</i>, <i>intensify</i>, <i>aggravate</i> and <i>compound</i> are similar, but <i>exacerbate</i> has the sense of an irritant being added in to make something bad even worse.</p></div>`;
