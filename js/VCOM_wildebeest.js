You might be able to see herds of <i>wildebeests</i> if you travel to the open plains of Africa south of the Sahara desert.</p><p class="long">Another name for a wildebeest is a <i>gnu</i>. The word <i>wildebeest</i> comes from the Afrikaans <i>wildebees</i>, or "wild beast," while <i>gnu</i> is derived from a name native Africans used for the animal. An antelope relative, the wildebeest is distinctive for its shaggy mane and front-heavy shape, with most of its weight in its forequarters. Wildebeests are migratory, traveling as much as 1000 miles each year.</p></div></div>`;
