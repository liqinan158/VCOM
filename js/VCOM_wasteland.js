An area may be a <i>wasteland</i> because of toxic materials in the soil, or due to climate conditions like strong winds.</p><p class="long">You can't grow anything in a wasteland, despite all that open space â€” typically, the soil doesn't have enough nutrients for plants to survive. Sometimes a barren area with limited biodiversity is called a <i>wasteland</i>, though a few species do grow there. A neglected urban area, like an empty lot or a playground that's unused and in disrepair, might also be called a <i>wasteland</i>. T.S. Eliot's most famous poem, "The Waste Land," alludes to a wasteland from Arthurian legend.</p></div>`;
