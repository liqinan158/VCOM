When the person conducting a wedding ceremony asks if anyone has an objection to the marriage, just keep quiet. That question is strictly <i>pro forma</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Pro forma</i> is a Latin term meaning “as a matter of form” or “for the sake of form.” If you do something pro forma, you are probably not giving it much attention; you are just going through the motions. Pro forma actions are formalities, which means they don’t have much practical value, but they must be done because that’s how they’ve always been done. A pro forma session of Congress has more to do with following the rules than with getting anything done.</p></div>`;
