var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">inverse</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If you notice that the more money you have, the less money your brother has, you’ve discovered an <i>inverse</i> relationship: when your bank account increases, his decreases.</p><p class="long">The word <i>inverse</i> traces back to the Latin <i>inversus</i>, from the past participle of <i>invertere</i>, meaning “turn upside down" or "turn about.” It’s a good word to use when you need to describe one of those topsy-turvy relationships in which when one thing goes up, the other goes down. It can also be used in a broader sense to mean “opposite.” You’ve probably heard someone begin a sentence by saying, “And the <i>inverse</i> was true for so and so . . .” That just means the opposite was true.</p></div>`;
