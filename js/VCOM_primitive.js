Since the phrase "primitive man" refers to the world's first people, you might think that the word <i>primate</i> has something to do with the similarity between early humans and monkeys, but it doesn't.  Monkey, apes, and humans are called primates because they're seen as standing on the first, or highest, rung of the animal-kingdom ladder.</p></div></div>`;
