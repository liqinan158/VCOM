Because Harry Potter's skin was so pale, his lightning bolt scar stood out <i>starkly</i> against his forehead.</p><p class="long">The adverb <i>starkly</i> is good for talking about things that are visually severe or harsh, like the silhouette of a crow that stands starkly against the gray sky. You can also use it for a more figurative kind of harshness: "The Australian wildfires starkly illustrate the effects of climate change." We can trace this word back to a root (which it shares with <i>stern</i>) that means "stiff."</p></div>`;
