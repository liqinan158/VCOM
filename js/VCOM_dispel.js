Note, however, that when <i>dispel</i> is used in reference to physical foes, it often has the added meaning of scattering your opponents in all directions. So, while you can <i>dispel</i> a pack of wild dogs, you should just <i>chase off</i> or <i>drive away</i> a lone wolf. Good luck with that, by the way.</p></div></div>`;
