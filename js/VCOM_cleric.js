The priest in an Episcopal church is a <i>cleric</i>, and so is a Muslim imam.</p><p class="long">The term <i>cleric</i> is less common than <i>clergyman</i> and <i>clergywoman</i>, but when you're talking about a Christian or Muslim religious leader, it's a great word to use. <i>Cleric</i> comes from the Latin <i>clericus</i>, "priest," and its Greek root <i>klÄ“ros</i>, "inheritance or heritage." It shares these roots with <i>clerk</i>, a word that was originally a synonym of <i>cleric</i> but today more often means "a person working in an office."</p></div></div>`;
