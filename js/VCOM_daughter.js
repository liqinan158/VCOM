Any connected group of women might be referred to as "daughters," For example, the "daughters of Zion" of the Bible and the "Daughters of Elysium" in Beethoven’s "Ode to Joy" closing to his Ninth Symphony.  If people say you are your mother's daughter, aside from pointing out the obvious they are saying the two of you have a lot in common.</p></div>`;
