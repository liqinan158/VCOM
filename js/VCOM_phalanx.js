From that sense, it came to mean any close-knit group. Another definition of <i>phalanx</i> — any bone in a finger or toe — also came out of the military sense: these bones work together closely, just like a military phalanx. The plural for these bones is <i>phalanges</i>, while  the plural for the other senses is <i>phalanxes</i>.</p></div></div>`;
