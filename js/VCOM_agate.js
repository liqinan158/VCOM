Jewelry, including pins and earrings, is sometimes made from <i>agate</i>.</p><p class="long">Agate is mainly found in volcanic rock, and it's often distinguished by its lines or bands, a result of silicate material layering as it filled in cracks in these ancient rocks. Agate has long been used for carving ornaments and vessels, including beads, marbles, jewelry, mortars, and pestles. The name <i>agate</i> comes from the Greek <i>akhates</i>, the name of a river in Sicily where the stone was commonly found about 3,000 years ago.</p></div>`;
