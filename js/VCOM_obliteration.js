Holding a lit match up to a balloon might cause its <i>obliteration</i>.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>obliteration</i> can describe a literal destruction, like an explosion or terrible fire, but it's also frequently used to mean a more figurative kind of eradication. You might, for example, hear people on the news talk about the obliteration of democracy in a country, or the obliteration of a politician's candidacy after a scandal is revealed. The word comes from the Latin <i>obliterare</i>, "cause to disappear, blot out, or erase."</p></div></div>`;
