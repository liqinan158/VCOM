In general, <i>sloops</i> are known as speedy boats that are relatively simple to rig with sails.</p><p class="long">If you spot a sailboat with a single mast and two sails, it's almost certainly a sloop. Sloops come in many sizes, from small dinghies to 100-foot sailboats. What they have in common is the way they're rigged, or how their sails and masts are organized.
