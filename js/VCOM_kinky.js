It's also a term for frizzy hair.</p><p class="long">As a general term, <i>kinky</i> can refer to anything that is far-out, quirky, or offbeat. More specifically, this is a sexual term for acts that are a little odd, such as a foot fetish. There's also kinky hair: hair with tight curls that is also called crisp, frizzy, and nappy. There's isn't any connection between kinky hair and the first two meanings of kinky. Words just mean different things, and no one knows exactly why.</p></div>`;
