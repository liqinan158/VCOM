var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">unfettered</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The adjective <i>unfettered</i> describes something or someone uninhibited and unrestrained. If you write mysteries novels for a living you probably turn your <i>unfettered</i> imagination to murder and mayhem.</p><p class="long"><i>Unfettered</i> comes from the Old English root word <i>fetor</i>, which was a chain or shackle for the feet. <i>Un-</i> means "not," so originally the word literally meant "not chained or shackled." Today there isn't much real shackling going on, so the adjective <i>unfettered</i> mainly describes something that is free or unrestrained. You'll see such uses as unfettered emotions, unfettered stock market growth, and unfettered speech.</p></div>`;
