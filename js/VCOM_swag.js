Just because your friend has a bag of <i>swag</i> does not make him a pirate (although the patch and wooden leg might say otherwise).</p><p class="long">Generally meaning “loot, booty, or plunder,” <i>swag</i> is the stuff in the bags of excited party-goers and plunderers alike. It can also be a bundle carried by a <i>swagman</i>, an Australian migrant worker or drifter. From the Old Norse (re: Viking) <i>sveggja</i>, meaning “to swing or sway,” the verb <i>swag</i> can mean “to sway unsteadily or stagger.” Your bag of swag may swag from its own weight, and you too may swag just trying to carry it.</p></div></div>`;
