Don't eat too much cotton candy at the fair, or you'll definitely get a <i>bellyache</i>!</p><p class="long">You might also refer to a bellyache as a tummy ache or an upset stomach. Whatever you call it, it's no fun, and it might even cause you to lie in bed and moan a little. As a verb, <i>bellyache</i> means "complain" or "whine." If your brother insists on taking part in a hotdog eating contest, you might be stuck listening to him bellyache about his bellyache later.</p></div>`;
