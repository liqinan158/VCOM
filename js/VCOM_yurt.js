Traditional <i>yurts</i> are portable, lending themselves well to nomadic lifestyles.</p><p class="long">A yurt's structure is usually provided by flexible wooden framing, covered by furs, felt, or canvas. The word comes from the Russian <i>yurta</i>, from a Turkic root that means "homeland," also literally referring to the imprint a yurt leaves in the ground when it's moved. In various parts of Central Asia, yurts have been common dwellings for thousands of years. In the U.S., where they're often used for camping, their popularity is more recent.</p></div>`;
