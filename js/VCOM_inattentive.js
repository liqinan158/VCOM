An <i>inattentive</i> lunch companion might spend the whole meal texting on his phone.</p><p class="long">Inattentive people are sometimes distracted, like an inattentive babysitter who loses track of the kids he's watching at the playground. You can also be inattentive simply through indifference or boredom â€” if you're inattentive at the opera, you're not paying attention to it because you're not interested in it. <i>Inattentive</i> tacks the "not" prefix <i>in-</i> onto <i>attentive</i>, from the Latin root <i>attendere</i>, "give heed to" or "stretch toward."</p></div>`;
