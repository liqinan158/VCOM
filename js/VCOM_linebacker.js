If you ever hear someone described as being "built like a <i>linebacker</i>," it means the person is large and strong.</p><p class="long">There are usually three or four linebackers on the field during play. A linebacker's job is to defend the goal area of the football field against runs, and to block plays by the opposing team. Linebackers usually stand behind the line of scrimmage in front of the defensive backs known as safeties. There are several different specific kinds of linebackers, including middle, outside, strongside, and weakside.</p></div></div>`;
