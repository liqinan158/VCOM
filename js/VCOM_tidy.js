If your desk were more <i>tidy</i>, you would be able to find your computer.</p><p class="long"><i>Tidy</i> (or <i>tidy up</i>) also means “to clean up” and is also a noun for a container for small objects, like scraps or sewing materials. These senses of <i>tidy</i> have a formal or even old-fashioned note. (We’re more likely to say <i>clean</i>, <i>organize</i>, or <i>bin</i> now in everyday conversation.) A less informal use is as an adjective, meaning “large.” If you can put the word <i>tidy</i> before your <i>profit</i> or the sum in your bank account, it’s a good thing.</p></div></div>`;
