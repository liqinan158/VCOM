If you’re in a cabin and a forest fire approaches, you’d better get in your car and <i>abandon</i> your cabin, or else be prepared to <i>abandon</i> your life.</p><p class="long">If you abandon something, you let it go, so when you describe someone as "acting with <i>abandon</i>," it means they have let go of restrictions or inhibitions. Maybe you like to dance with abandon in the privacy of your own room. But <i>abandon</i> could also mean people have abandoned their senses. To "drive with <i>abandon</i>," for example, means to drive recklessly.</p></div></div>`;
