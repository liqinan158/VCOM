But more often it refers to gases being released into the air, like greenhouse gasses or emissions from power plants and factories. Anytime your body emits something (sweat, drool, gas), it's also considered an emission. Be careful not to confuse this word with the closely spelled <i>omission</i> â€” that's something that's been left out.</p></div></div>`;
