During World War I, planes fitted with machine guns flew low so they could <i>strafe</i> targets below.</p><p class="long">Think of a quick-firing machine gun or rapid series of bombs to understand the military verb <i>strafe</i>. This technique made it possible to mount deadly attacks on the enemy, provided that planes could fly at very low altitudes. Technology improvements by World War II meant that pilots of these planes were better protected in cockpits. The word <i>strafe</i> comes from a German catchphrase used during World War I, <i>Gott strafe England</i>, "may God punish England."</p></div></div>`;
