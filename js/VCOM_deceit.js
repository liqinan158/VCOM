If you want to keep your true love true to you, avoid any acts of <i>deceit</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Deceit</i> comes from the Latin for "cheat." When you deceive someone, you give them a false impression, mislead them so as to get away with something bad. If a person speaks in a way that gives a false impression, we call the way he speaks "deceptive." If someone pretends to be someone else, thatâ€™s an act of deceit, like when a thief pretends to be a valet parking attendant and takes off with your car.</p></div></div>`;
