This word comes from the French <i>pliable</i>, "to bend," and a Latin root meaning "to fold." Anything you can bend, fold, twist or turn without breaking it has this quality of pliability. Figuratively, <i>pliability</i> refers to someone who's easy to "bend" or influence: "The pliability of those kids meant they'd believe anything they read online."</p></div></div>`;
