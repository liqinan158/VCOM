If you get a <i>fellowship</i> to do research on insects, it might bug your colleagues who didn't get one.</p><p class="long">Use <i>fellowship</i> to refer to someone's company or companionship. Your grandmother might prefer the fellowship of people her own age, since they remember the same historic events as she does and know the same songs. A <i>fellowship</i> is also a community of people who share common beliefs or interests. A fellowship of knitters might meet weekly at a cafe in your town to exchange ideas and knit together.</p></div></div>`;
