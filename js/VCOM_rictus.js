If the star of a play finds herself overcome by stage fright, she might forget her lines and stand, trembling, her mouth twisted into a <i>rictus</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>rictus</i> most often describes a smile that doesn't convey delight or happiness â€” instead, it's a kind of horrified, involuntary grin. Your smile might freeze on your face in a rictus during a truly terrifying amusement park ride, or your discomfort as you watch your friend sing badly in a talent show might be reflected in your rictus of a grin. In Latin, <i>rictus</i> means "open mouth," from <i>rict-</i>, or "gaped."</p></div></div>`;
