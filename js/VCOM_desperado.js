Think spurs, horses, and hip holsters— and a <i>desperado</i> with a cowboy hat on his head and a bandana tied around his face.</p><p class="long">You probably know the common word <i>desperate</i>. A hundred years ago, the word wasn’t just an adjective — it was also a noun. A desperate was someone in despair, someone in a desperate situation. And the American frontier was full of such people, people who had gone West to find gold but missed out on a big payoff. <i>Desperado</i> has the same meaning as the noun <i>desperate</i>, but with a Spanish influence.</p></div></div>`;
