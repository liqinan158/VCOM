When you receive good news in an <i>email</i>, you can forward the message to your friends and family.</p><p class="long">Most email these days uses the Internet for connecting the sender and recipient. Unlike some other kinds of messaging, when you send an email to a friend, she doesn't have to be online at the same time to get your message. The next time she checks her email account, your email will be waiting for her. <i>Email</i>, sometimes spelled <i>e-mail</i>, is short for <i>electronic mail</i>, and was coined in the early 1980s.</p></div></div>`;
