As you might imagine, a <i>dirge</i> is usually quite sad. Another word with a similar meaning that you might know is “requiem.”</p><p class="long">The noun <i>dirge</i> comes from the Latin <i>dirige</i>, which means “direct,” and is the beginning of a prayer that translates as “Direct my way in your sight, O Lord my God.” <i>Dirge</i> can still have a religious meaning, but it can also be any sad and mournful song, poem, or hymn composed or performed in memory of someone who has died. You can also say that something mournful sounds like a dirge, using the word in a more poetic sense.</p></div></div>`;
