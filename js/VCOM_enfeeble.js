Your governor's budget cuts might <i>enfeeble</i> the state's public school system.</p><p class="long">If an illness weakens you — makes you feel frail and shaky — it enfeebles you. Aging enfeebles us, and the lack of Vitamin D in the winter also enfeebles many people. You can also say that making it harder for people to vote enfeebles the democratic process. The verb <i>enfeeble</i> combines the prefix <i>en-</i>, "cause to be," with <i>feeble</i>, with its Latin root <i>flebilis</i>, "that is to be wept over."</p></div></div>`;
