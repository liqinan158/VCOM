var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">disquietude</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Sometimes, maybe for no reason at all, you might become agitated with a feeling of restless agitation. This feeling is a sense of <i>disquietude</i>, an edgy feeling that something in your universe is out of order.</p><p class="long">If you break down the word <i>disquietude</i> you come to its root word, <i>quiet</i>, which means still or noiseless. The <i>dis-</i> prefix means "not," giving it the opposite meaning, and the ending <i>-tude</i> makes it a state of being. So the word literally means "state of being unquiet." For example, it was said in the Washington Post that the 19th-20th-century artist Edward Hopper's paintings present a picture of the disquietude, or uneasiness, of American life.</p></div></div>`;
