You might <i>construct</i> a sand castle the next time you're at the beach, or you might <i>construct</i> a theory about why your brother always manages to get away with breaking the rules.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>construct</i> comes from the Latin word <i>constructus</i>, meaning “to heap up.” If you work in construction you're in the business of building things, and you probably construct buildings, roads, municipal parks, and other large permanent structures. Students of psychology are familiar with the noun form of <i>construct</i>, which refers to an abstract concept. Much of psychological theory is founded on constructs — like gender, morality, and intelligence.</p></div></div>`;
