Increasing the <i>salinity</i> of a solution will make it sterile, which is why it is often used in medical procedures.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>salinity</i> is derived from the word <i>saline</i> thought to come from the Latin word <i>salinium</i> meaning "salt cellar" and the suffix <i>ity</i> meaning "condition or quality of being."  Mixing salt with water makes a solution with high salinity, which has a sterilizing effect when used in medicine. <i>Salinity</i> is also associated with taste and food.  You'll want to avoid foods with high salinity if you have high blood pressure.</p></div></div>`;
