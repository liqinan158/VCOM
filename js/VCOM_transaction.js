When you go to the bank, fill out a form, and deposit your paycheck, you make a <i>transaction</i>.</p><p class="long">An important business deal can be called a transaction, particularly the buying or selling of goods, but you can call any exchange with another person a transaction. There are transactions involving money, ideas, and even e-mail. The Latin root <i>transactionem</i> describes an agreement or accomplishment.
