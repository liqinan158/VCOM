It can be square or arched, and the stage curtain is generally directly behind it.</p><p class="long">The ancient Greeks gave us the modern concept of theater and, with it, the <i>proscenium</i>, one of the divisions of the stage. The word itself can be broken down into <i>prō-</i>, "in front of," and skēnē, "scene": The proscenium is thus the part "in front of the scenery." In a modern theater, the proscenium makes up the so-called "fourth wall," the invisible barrier that separates the stage from the audience and through which the audience watches the action.</p></div></div>`;
