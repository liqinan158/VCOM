When you're sick in bed, it's nice to have someone around to treat you with <i>solicitude</i>, hovering nearby, bringing you cups of tea, and handing you tissues all day.</p><p class="long">Someone who shows you solicitude obviously cares about you. You could act with solicitude toward a lost child in a shopping mall if you calm him, dry his tears, and help him find his mother. Sometimes solicitude implies too much concern, bordering on anxiety. The Latin word for <i>agitated</i> is <i>sollicitus</i> â€” which is also the root of <i>solicitude</i>.</p></div></div>`;
