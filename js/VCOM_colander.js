It's a bowl, usually made of plastic or metal, with holes in it to allow liquid to drain away from the food.</p><p class="long">Colanders are used for draining anything â€” for instance, if you're washing fruit, a <i>colander</i> would make the job quick and easy. If you're cooking pasta, you toss the pasta into a pot of boiling water, then when it's cooked, you pour the contents of the pot through a <i>colander</i>, and what's left behind in the <i>colander</i>, drained and ready to eat, is the pasta.</p></div></div>`;
