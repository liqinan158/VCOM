If you become a world famous actor, the folks in your home town might treat you as an <i>eminence</i> when you come home for Thanksgiving. Just don't expect your family to do the same.</p><p class="long"><i>Eminence</i> traces back to the Latin adjective <i>ēminēntia</i>, meaning high or lofty. We don't usually use it for mountain tops, however; it's social loftiness that scores <i>eminence</i>. Some special people are addressed as "your eminence," in the same way you'd call a judge "your honor." You can attain eminence or be an eminence. If you become a physical therapist, you might work with another kind of eminence: the high bit protruding from a bone where tendons or ligaments attach.</p></div>`;
