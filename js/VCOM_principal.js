Is your <i>principal</i> goal for the summer to have fun or to earn some extra money?</p><p class="long">The word, <i>principal,</i> comes from the Latin <i>principalis</i> "first in importance" and is related to the title of prince. You can see the relation when you think about its meanings â€” the head of a school, the starring actor in a film, and the client of an agent. Don't confuse <i>principal</i> with its homophone <i>principle</i>, a moral rule or law of nature. If you talk about a country's principal exports, you mean the main ones.</p></div>`;
