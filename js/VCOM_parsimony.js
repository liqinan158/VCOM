So you're not just saving your pennies for a rainy day — you're clipping coupons, re-using dryer sheets, and refusing to pay full price for anything.</p><p class="long">It's not a bad thing to engage in a little parsimony. Related to an ancient Latin word meaning "to spare," <i>parsimony</i> keeps your checking account in the black and your retirement plan well funded. But get a little too parsimonious and you might start to look like Uncle Scrooge — an old miser who learned the hard way that practicing extreme parsimony doesn't win you love and admiration.</p></div></div>`;
