You'll often see  a <i>bulldozer</i> among the vehicles on a construction site.</p><p class="long">Although many people have a tendency to call any giant truck a <i>bulldozer</i>, it's actually a specific kind of tractor with a blade called a "<i>dozer</i> blade" at the front and a big claw, or "ripper" at the back.
