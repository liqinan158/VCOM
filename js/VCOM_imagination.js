That shark in your bathtub must have been in your <i>imagination</i> — or was it?</p><p class="long">Often shunned for living in a dream world, <i>imagination</i> is behind unicorns, Big Foot, and excessive daydreaming. But it’s humans’ ability to picture what is not there, and to be resourceful and creative, that is behind many of our achievements. Maybe that’s why  Albert Einstein said “Imagination is more important than knowledge.” After all, without a little imagination, we wouldn’t have the pyramids, the space shuttles, or the <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy.</p></div></div>`;
