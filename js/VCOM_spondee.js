var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">spondee</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">In a poem, a two-syllable unit of text that's pronounced with equal stress on both syllables is a <i>spondee</i>. Words like "childhood" and "woodchuck" are usually pronounced as <i>spondees</i>.</p><p class="long">Like the iamb, the anapest, and the dactyl, a spondee is a metrical foot. Rather than structuring the meter of an entire poem, a spondee is more likely to show up as an irregular foot, altering the rhythm or adding interest to a line. If you read a poem out loud at a high volume, and you hear yourself placing equal emphasis on two syllables in a row, you might have found a spondee. Congratulations!</p></div>`;
