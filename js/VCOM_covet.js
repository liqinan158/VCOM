If it's 95 degrees out and humid, you may find yourself <i>coveting</i> your neighbor's air conditioner.</p><p class="long">If the word <i>covet</i> sounds familiar, you're thinking of the Tenth Commandment: "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbor's." Basically this means you should be happy with your electronic gadgets and not be jealous when a friend gets something better.</p></div>`;
