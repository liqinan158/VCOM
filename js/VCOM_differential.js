You and your sister may get <i>differential</i> benefits from eating a vegetarian diet.</p><p class="long">You're most likely to come across the adjective <i>differential</i> in scholarly or scientific writing — it's really just a more formal way to say "different" or "differing." Sociological studies or articles often describe differential circumstances or outcomes, like the differential effects on various children of being raised with one parent. The Latin <i>differentia</i> is at the root of <i>differential</i> — it means "diversity or difference," and it comes from <i>differre</i>, "to set apart."</p></div></div>`;
