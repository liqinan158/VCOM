You might pity the poor <i>wretch</i> who was fired at work over something that wasn’t even his fault.</p><p class="long"><i>Wretch</i> traces back to the Old English word <i>wrecca</i>, meaning “banished person” — so no wonder a wretch is so unhappy! A wretch is in such a bad situation that a sense of pity typically goes along with the word, and you’ll often see the terms “poor wretch” or “unfortunate wretch.” <i>Wretch</i> can also be used more informally to describe someone who’s wicked or hateful, like that ungrateful wretch who complained to the boss when you brought snacks to work.</p></div></div>`;
