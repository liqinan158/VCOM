Airplanes use <i>intercoms</i> so the pilot can tell passengers, "Fasten your seat belts!"</p><p class="long">Many schools have an intercom system, so that students, teachers, and administrators can broadcast announcements to every classroom. Some intercoms operate as one-way communication, while others are two-way intercoms: a friend's apartment building might have an intercom you can speak into, telling her you've arrived, and she can respond, telling you she's buzzing you in. <i>Intercom</i>, dating from 1940, is a shortened form of <i>intercommunication</i>.</p></div></div>`;
