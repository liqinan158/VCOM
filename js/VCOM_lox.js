You can almost always find <i>lox</i> at traditional delis in large cities; it's the pink, slimy stuff next to the cold cuts.</p><p class="long">There are many different kinds of lox, all of them first cured in brine (a marinade of salted water), and most of them then lightly smoked. Bagels and lox is a speciality of most Jewish delicatessens, which is fitting since the word <i>lox</i> comes from the Yiddish <i>laks</i>, or "salmon." It shares an Indo-European root with the Scottish and Scandinavian word for lox, <i>gravlax</i>.</p></div></div>`;
