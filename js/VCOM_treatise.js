var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">treatise</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>treatise</i> is a formal written paper about a specific subject. It’s like an essay but longer. A treatise is usually about a serious subject, so you might read a treatise on democracy, but you probably won't read a treatise about chewing gum.</p><p class="long">The word <i>treatise</i> is related to the verb <i>treat</i>, in the sense of "deal with,” like the way a doctor treats a patient. Like a doctor, a treatise examines a subject from all angles. It has nothing to do with treats, unless you’re writing a treatise on desserts, which would be weird. More appropriate topics for a treatise include philosophy, religion, economics, and so forth. An example of a political <i>treatise</i> is <i>The Prince</i> by Machiavelli, which basically argues that “the ends justify the means.”</p></div>`;
