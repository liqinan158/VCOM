An authentic <i>ragout</i> is cooked very slowly at a low heat.</p><p class="long">A <i>ragout</i> is essentially the same as a stew, except that most recipes for ragout are originally French, and often the meat and vegetables are cut into smaller pieces than in a typical stew. Ragouts vary in flavor and ingredients — you can skip the meat and make a vegetarian ragout, for example. In French, it's <i>ragoût</i>, from the Middle French <i>ragoûter</i>, "awaken the appetite," which has the root <i>goût</i>, or "taste."</p></div>`;
