A <i>petal</i> is the lovely colorful leaf-like ring around the center of the flower, a thin plate for a fairy. The petals make up a flower’s corolla, surrounding the center. You can rip them off one by one as you say, “She loves me, she loves me not” until the last petal is picked. She loves me!</p></div></div>`;
