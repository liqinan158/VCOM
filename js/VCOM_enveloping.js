An <i>enveloping</i> fog blankets everything, seeming to close in on the entire landscape.</p><p class="long">Some things are literally enveloping, like your grandpa's enveloping hug or an enveloping blanket around a chilly toddler. Others are enveloping in a more figurative way, like enveloping mist that seems to surround you or an enveloping fear that overcomes you as you watch a scary movie. <i>Enveloping</i> comes from the Old French <i>envoleper</i>, "cover, fold up or wrap up," from <i>en-</i>, "in," and <i>voloper</i>, "wrap up."</p></div>`;
