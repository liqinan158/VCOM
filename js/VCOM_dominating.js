If your team is <i>dominating</i> on the basketball court, you're not only winning, you're outplaying your opponents.</p><p class="long"><i>Dominating</i> comes from the root word <i>dominate</i>, which comes from the Latin word <i>dominari</i>, meaning "to rule, to govern." When you're a dominating presence, you're self-assured and clearly in charge of your environment â€” possibly even to the point of being bossy. An object can be dominating too, such as that tall church in the distance that's <i>dominating</i> the landscape.</p></div>`;
