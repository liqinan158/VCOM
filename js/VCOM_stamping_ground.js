You could describe your favorite local coffee shop as your <i>stamping ground</i>.</p><p class="long">A very slightly different way to say <i>stamping ground</i> is <i>stomping ground</i>. Either way, you're talking about a place you love to visit, a usual hangout, or even the neighborhood where you live. You could say, for example, "In college, Harvard Square was my regular <i>stamping ground</i>." The phrase, which came into use in the 1820's, comes from the way wild animals sometimes mark their usual territory by stamping down the soil or grass with their paws.</p></div></div>`;
