Your grandfather might joke that he and your grandmother have been <i>husband</i> and wife for so long because she has the patience of a saint and he is deaf as a post.</p><p class="long">The word <i>husband</i> comes from the Old Norse <i>hūsbōndi</i>, where <i>hūs</i> meant house and <i>bōndi</i> meant dweller. As a verb, <i>husband</i> means to conserve resources and use them frugally. Because of the flooding in the area, roads are cut off and everyone is being asked to husband their supplies. This conservation of resources sense of <i>husband</i> also occurs in the related noun <i>husbandry</i>.</p></div>`;
