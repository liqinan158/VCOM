When something is "relevant," it matters. Its relevance is clear. <i>Relevance</i> is simply the noun form of the adjective "relevant," which means "important to the matter at hand." Artists and politicians are always worried about their relevance. If they are no longer relevant, they may not keep their job. Someone without relevance might be called "irrelevant."</p></div></div>`;
