You probably recognize this root in words like <i>mortal</i>, <i>mortician</i>, and <i>mortuary</i>. <i>Moribund</i> means "near death," but it can also mean something that is coming to an end, nearly obsolete, or stagnant. For example, as streaming videos over the Internet becomes a more and more popular way to watch movies and television shows, the DVD has become a <i>moribund</i> medium.</p></div>`;
