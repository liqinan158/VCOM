After a flood, a homeowner is lucky to find papers and photos that are <i>untainted</i> by the mildew that covers most of his things.</p><p class="long">While <i>untainted</i> can describe things that are physically unspoiled or free from contaminants, it's more common to use the adjective to talk about the character of a person or group. A candidate with an untainted reputation has no record of controversy, and a town that's untainted by chain stores might have a more charming, old-fashioned character. The moral sense of the word — "pure," in a religious way — was the earliest meaning.</p></div>`;
