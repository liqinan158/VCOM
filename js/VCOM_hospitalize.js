If you get a bad infection, your doctor may decide to <i>hospitalize</i> you.</p><p class="long">Any time doctors decide that a patient ought to be treated intensively or needs a serious kind of surgery, they hospitalize their patient. It's more common to find this verb in the phrase "was <i>hospitalized</i>," as in "My favorite basketball player was <i>hospitalized</i> after collapsing on the court." Grammar snobs have long disapproved of verbs formed with the <i>-ize</i> suffix, and <i>hospitalize</i> was controversial when it was coined around 1870.</p></div></div>`;
