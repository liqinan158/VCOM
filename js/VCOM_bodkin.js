A <i>bodkin</i> is a short knife with a thin blade.</p><p class="long">This sweet little word isn’t so sweet — it’s a dagger with a thin blade that’s used as a weapon. It is little though, and easy to hide in a cape. The bodkin is an old weapon that dates to the days of Old English. In fact, Hamlet mentioned a "bare <i>bodkin</i>" in his "to be or not to be" soliloquy! <i>Bodkin</i> is also a word for other little sharp things, like a kind of hemming needle or hair pin, but either way, you're most likely to find one in a museum.</p></div>`;
