So you’re an <i>accomplice</i> to the gas station robbery if you distracted the store manager while your partner in crime raided the registers for cash.</p><p class="long">Coming from the Old French word <i>complice</i>, which means “a confederate,” an <i>accomplice</i> is an ally or partaker, sometimes in wrongdoing. Novelist Saul Bellow famously said that "when we ask for advice, we are usually looking for an <i>accomplice</i>.” What he means, in more direct terms, is that we run potential plans by others because we're looking for approval or someone to go along with us, not because we truly want their opinion.</p></div></div>`;
