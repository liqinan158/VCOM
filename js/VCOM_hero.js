But when David Bowie sings, “We can be <i>hero</i>es,” he’s not talking about sandwiches. He’s talking about the more popular kind of <i>hero</i> — the kind who saves your life!</p><p class="long">A hero is someone who does fantastic things that people love. The guy who rescues a skater from a frozen pond is a hero. A hero can be the main character of a story, too, if people root for him. Spiderman is the hero of the comic series: he's the central character, but he also saves people. The word <i>hero</i> goes back to the Greek, referring to a demigod.</p></div>`;
