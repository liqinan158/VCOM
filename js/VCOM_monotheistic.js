But other religions, like Buddhism and Hinduism, are <i>polytheistic</i> — meaning they believe in many gods. Usually in a monotheistic religion, God (with a capital G) is an all-powerful being who created the universe and knows everything. Monotheistic religions tend to look at other types of believers as pagans, heathens, and heretics.</p></div>`;
