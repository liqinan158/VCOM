The shape of the twisted object can also be called <i>torsion</i>, like the <i>torsion</i> of a tree's branches that makes it tricky to build a treehouse.</p><p class="long">In physics, you can calculate torsion using a formula. The turning or twisting force that causes torsion is called <i>torque</i>. Both words share a Latin root, <i>torquere</i>, "to twist or distort." <i>Torsion</i> first meant "wringing pain in the bowels," from the idea that abdominal pain was caused by twisted insides. Medically, <i>torsion</i> is still used today for conditions caused by twisting, like a torsion fracture, when a bone breaks while twisting.</p></div>`;
