Hitting someone who isn't looking is a cheap shot. Things that aren't very well made and use low-quality materials are cheap. When someone — especially a woman — is dressed in a trashy way, people say "You look <i>cheap</i>!" And if you have a stingy Uncle Scrooge in your family, you can call him cheap or even a cheapskate.</p></div>`;
