Your grandma might greet you <i>familiarly</i> by saying, "Hi, sweetheart!"</p><p class="long">Something that's <i>familiar</i> is either well known or very informal and intimate. The adverb <i>familiarly</i> describes things that are said and done in a familiar way. If the news reports on something in a familiarly sensationalist way, it's a type of reporting that you see all the time. But if your best friend hugs you familiarly, he does it lovingly. It's not surprising that <i>familiarly</i> shares a Latin root with <i>family</i>.</p></div>`;
