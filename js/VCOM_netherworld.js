Sartre portrayed it as a room with annoying furniture and a quirky love triangle. On Earth, <i>netherworld</i> refers to a secret underworld or a no-manâ€™s land.</p><p class="long">In many religions and mythologies, including Buddhism and Islam, there is some concept of a world after death, a place where departed souls go. The netherworld is often deep underground, and sometimes the dead are sent there as a kind of punishment, although often it's merely a stop on the way to an afterlife. A netherworld up here is usually some seedy underworld-type situation where secret things happen. <i>Netherworld</i>, "place beneath the earth," comes from <i>nether</i>, "down or below."</p></div>`;
