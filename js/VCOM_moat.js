A <i>moat</i> means "Keep out!"</p><p class="long">You're most likely to hear about <i>moats</i> if you read a fairy tale or a history of medieval times. This water-filled ditch is one of the lines of defense for a castle. In the old days, it was pretty effective. If you filled the moat with a deadly fish — like a piranha — that was an even better defense. A moat is pretty much the opposite of a welcome mat.</p></div>`;
