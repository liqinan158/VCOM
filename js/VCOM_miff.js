If your sister's constant humming is starting to drive you crazy, you can tell her it <i>miffs</i> you.</p><p class="long">Long ago, the word <i>miff</i> was also used to mean "huff" or "pique," so you might have described yourself as "in a <i>miff</i>" about your sister's tuneless humming. These days, you're more likely to see the adjective <i>miffed</i> describing someone who's irked: "I am so <i>miffed</i> that none of my friends came to my party on time." Experts guess that <i>miff</i> comes from the annoyed sound you might make when you're really miffed.</p></div>`;
