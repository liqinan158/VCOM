Because it's so hard to climb out of a <i>quagmire</i>, the word has also come to also mean any difficult or sticky situation you find yourself in.</p><p class="long">Long ago, <i>quag</i> was a synonym for "bog" or "marsh," a swampy area where water seems to sit instead of drain out. <i>Mire</i> is another word to describe such a place. As a verb <i>mire</i> means "stuck," like someone who's mired in quicksand or mired in work — both prevent you from going anywhere. In a quagmire, you get stuck physically — or, even more commonly, in a situation that is hard to escape because there is no easy solution.</p></div></div>`;
