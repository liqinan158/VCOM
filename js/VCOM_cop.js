When it's a verb, it means "to steal" or to "strike an attitude." An angry cop might say to a young troublemaker, "Hey, don't <i>cop</i> an attitude with me!" In the US, a legal defendant can also "<i>cop</i> a plea," or agree to a plea bargain. The earliest meaning of <i>cop</i> was "to catch," probably from the Latin <i>capere</i>, "to take."</p></div>`;
