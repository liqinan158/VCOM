In fact, now the word is really used only in a legal sense. It's from the Latin <i>ad</i> "to" plus <i>quitare</i> meaning "set free." Getting an acquittal is still like being set free. Free to do what you want, any old time! So now the only time you'll need the word is in court, and it's one word you hope to hear if you've been busted.</p></div>`;
