For centuries humans have believe that dogs are <i>domesticated</i> wolves, but DNA testing reveals that they are in fact a different species.</p><p class="long"><i>Domesticated</i> comes from <i>domus</i>, the Latin word for home, which is easy to remember — instead of a "roof over our heads" think of your "home as a dome." <i>Domus</i> gives us not only <i>domesticated</i> (adapted to the home or the farm), but also domestic (cooking and cleaning are "domestic" chores), a domestic (someone like a maid who works inside a home as a paid employee), and domicile (a building that serves as a home). Thus <i>domesticated</i> means an animal tamed to live in your home — or, as some women like to joke, a man.</p></div>`;
