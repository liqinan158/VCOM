The <i>pettiness</i> of an airplane passenger's complaint that there’s a smudge on the window is likely to cause the flight attendants to pay no attention to it.</p><p class="long">Pettiness — whether it's in a term paper or an argument between politicians — is a focus on issues so small and trivial that it's almost silly. Another way to use the noun <i>pettiness</i> is to describe the quality of a person that's also called "small-mindedness." A friend's pettiness can be hard to live with, since she focuses on trivial matters and has a tendency to seek revenge for the slightest offenses. <i>Petty</i> comes from the French word for "small," <i>petit</i>.</p></div></div>`;
