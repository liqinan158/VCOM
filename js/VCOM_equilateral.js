A square is equilateral, because all of its sides are the same length. A rhombus is also equilateral â€” its sides are also the same length. A triangle can be equilateral too, but not a scalene triangle, which has three sides of different lengths. The word <i>equal</i> should help you remember what <i>equilateral</i> means. You can also use it as a noun for an equilateral shape.</p></div>`;
