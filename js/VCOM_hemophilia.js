People with <i>hemophilia</i> are at risk of bleeding a lot even from minor injuries.</p><p class="long">The medical term <i>hemophilia</i> comes from the German <i>h√§mophile</i>, from Greek roots <i>haima</i>, "blood or streams of blood," and <i>philia</i>, which means "to love" but can also have the sense of "tendency to." The earliest recorded case of hemophilia was in the 10th century, but the disorder wasn't understood until the 1800s. Men are much more likely than women to suffer from hemophilia.</p></div></div>`;
