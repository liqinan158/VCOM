If you want to take a nap, a <i>chaise longue</i> is just about perfect.</p><p class="long">This French word has often been misspelled and mispronounced, because it looks so much like <i>chase lounge</i>, and it is the kind of furniture made for lounging. However, the original and correct spelling comes direct from French: <i>chaise longue</i>, which literally means long chair: exactly what it is. A chaise longue is like a recliner, and it can also be called a chaise or a daybed.</p></div></div>`;
