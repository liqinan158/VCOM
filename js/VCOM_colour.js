But don't get thrown off by the spelling of this word for pigmentation. When Noah Webster was compiling his dictionary in 1828, he wanted to emphasize that the young United States spoke a different dialect than Britain. <i>Colour</i> with a "u" is a British spelling, and it was probably Webster who shortened it to <i>color</i> in America. Words like <i>honour</i> and <i>flavour</i> got the same treatment.</p></div>`;
