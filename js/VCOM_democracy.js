"People power" remains central to democracy, whether you're describing a country or a much smaller organization. If your glee club is run as a <i>democracy</i>, then everybody gets to vote on questions like what you're going to sing and what kind of outfits youâ€™re going to wear. Because democracy assumes some idea of equality, it's often used to mean a just society, one in which everyone is treated equally.</p></div>`;
