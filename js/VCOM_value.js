As a verb, it means "holding something in high regard," (like "I <i>value</i> our friendship") but it can also mean "determine how much something is worth," like a prize valued at $200. The noun <i>value</i> also relates to worth, like a used car that is a good value, the value of good health, or the ideals we have, like "My <i>values</i> include honesty and fairness."</p></div></div>`;
