When you <i>enter</i> your house after school, you might pet your cat and take off your shoes.</p><p class="long">You might enter the kitchen to see what's for dinner, or enter the library to look for a book to read. In both cases, you go from one place into another, through a doorway. If you're an actor, the word <i>enter</i> takes on a different meaning: to appear on the stage during a play. The stage directions might read, "<i>Enter</i> the King, stage left." Countries also enter wars, and people enter contests â€” they register or become involved.</p></div></div>`;
