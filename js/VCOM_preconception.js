You might have the <i>preconception</i> that all New Yorkers are rude until you visit the city and start meeting friendly people.</p><p class="long">Imagine you give your friend an assessment of a popular TV show, saying, "Oh, it's so boring!" despite the fact that you've never seen it. Your negative opinion of the show is a preconception â€” you may be correct about the show, but you won't know until you actually sit down a watch a few episodes. <i>Preconception</i> comes from <i>pre</i>, "before," and the Latin <i>concipere</i>, "to take in and hold."</p></div>`;
