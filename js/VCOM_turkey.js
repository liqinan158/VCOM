If you've ever celebrated Thanksgiving in the U.S. or Canada, you've probably seen the large fowl <i>turkey</i> cooked and taking center stage at the elaborate holiday meal.</p><p class="long">Beloved as <i>turkeys</i> may be as holiday-eating fare, you, as a human, probably don't want to be called a <i>turkey</i>. The word is an insult, referring to a person who has done something ill advised or stupid, as in that uncle who decides to introduce his new girlfriend to his ex-wife on Thanksgiving Day. Irredeemable? Perhaps not if he then makes three strikes in a row while bowling later that day â€” earning himself a coveted <i>turkey</i>. <i>Turkey</i> can also refer to "brass tacks." When it's time to outline the facts of a deal, it's time for "talking <i>turkey</i>," always a good thing.</p></div></div>`;
