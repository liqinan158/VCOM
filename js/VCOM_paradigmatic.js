Monet's paintings are <i>paradigmatic</i> of impressionism â€” they are a typical example of that style of art.</p><p class="long">Use <i>paradigmatic</i> when you're talking about things that are archetypal or representative of some category and you want to sound impressive. You'll come across it if you study the subject of linguistics, where "<i>paradigmatic</i> analysis" is one way of analyzing a text, by examining patterns within it. The Greek word for "pattern," <i>paradeigma</i>, is the root of <i>paradigmatic</i>.</p></div></div>`;
