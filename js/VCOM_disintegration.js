When something is destroyed, broken up into pieces, or falls apart on its own, that’s <i>disintegration</i>.</p><p class="long">If you know that <i>integration</i> brings things or people together, you won't be surprised that <i>disintegration</i> means things are coming apart. Disintegration is what happens when a company breaks into smaller companies or when a band splits up. Often, disintegration is physical — a bomb could cause the disintegration of its target. The decomposition (rotting) of a body is an example of disintegration. When something radioactive decays, that's disintegration, too. Disintegration is when it all falls apart.</p></div></div>`;
