A genealogist studies the history of a family. A person who studies etymology does the same thing with words. Etymology looks at the roots of words — for example, whether they started out as Latin, Greek, or as some other language — and how they took on their current meaning. When you learn that the <i>-logy</i> part of <i>etymology</i> almost always means "the study of," that is, in itself, etymology.</p></div></div>`;
