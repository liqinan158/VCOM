An art exhibit might have the paintings of one period <i>juxtaposed</i> with those from another to emphasize how different the two periods were.</p><p class="long">The word <i>juxtaposed</i> comes from the Latin <i>juxta</i>, meaning "next" and the French <i>poser</i>, meaning "to place." When two objects are juxtaposed, they are placed next to each other, or side-by-side for comparison. It doesn't just have to be objects. After a guest manager's style was juxtaposed with your normal manager, you decided to look for a new job.</p></div></div>`;
