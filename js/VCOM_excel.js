Someone who excels at the violin might practice five hours a day because they are striving for <i>excellence</i>, meaning outstanding-ness. You could describe their performance as <i>excellent</i>, or fantastic. That doesn't mean you yourself want to practice five hours a day. <i>Excel</i> means to stand out, and some of us are pretty happy standing right where we are.</p></div></div>`;
