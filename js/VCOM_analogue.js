For example, a lobster's claw might be considered an <i>analogue</i> to the human hand, as both have similar functions of grabbing and holding.  Keep your claws to yourself!</p><p class="long">The word <i>analogue</i> (also spelled <i>analog</i>) comes from the Greek <i>ana</i>, meaning "up to," and <i>logos</i>, meaning, among other things, "ratio" and "proportion."  In 1946, it entered computer language as an adjective to describe a type of signal that is continuous in amplitude. It has since been largely replaced by a digital signal. Analogues are often used in college entrance exams, i.e., "a is to b as c is to d."</p></div>`;
