A <i>speculator</i> might, for example, invest in a risky stock in the hopes she can sell it eventually at a profit.</p><p class="long">In a way, everyone who invests in the financial market is a bit of a speculator â€” the possibility of losing money is always there, as is a chance (and hope) of making money. Gamblers are speculators too, hoping to win big but vulnerable to losing everything on a poker game. Less commonly, a <i>speculator</i> is simply someone who speculates, or guesses without enough information. The financial meaning dates from the 18th century.</p></div>`;
