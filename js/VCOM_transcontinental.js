In the nineteenth century, the First Transcontinental Railroad was built in the United States. As well as being the first railway to cross an entire continent, it also marked the coining of the word <i>transcontinental</i>, from <i>trans</i>, "across," and <i>continental</i>, "of a continent."</p></div></div>`;
