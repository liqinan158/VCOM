var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">odorous</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Anything that has a strong scent can be described as <i>odorous</i>. Usually if you say something is <i>odorous</i> you mean that it smells unpleasant — like an <i>odorous</i> blue cheese made from unpasteurized milk.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>odorous</i> comes from the Latin <i>odorus</i>, meaning “fragrant.” Typically, you wouldn’t say, “those roses you sent me are so <i>odorous</i>!” Although that comment could be literally correct, the implication would be insulting to the giver of said roses. More common uses of <i>odorous</i> might include: odorous gym mats, odorous garbage can, odorous gas fumes — you get the picture. Or rather the stench.</p></div>`;
