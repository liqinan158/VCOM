Now, <i>approve</i> means to officially agree. You might need the principal to sign off on, or approve, any purchase of new materials for the classroom. Congress can also approve a bill or budget in this way. It’s important to remember that, like <i>apple</i> and <i>appropriate</i>, <i>approve</i> is spelled with a double “p.”</p></div>`;
