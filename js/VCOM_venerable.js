You become <i>venerable</i> by achieving great things or just by living long enough.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>venerable</i> means "admired" and "respected" â€” it should describe how you feel about old folks and bosses, for example. It describes the wise old man at the top of the mountain who tells you the meaning of life. As a noun, the <i>Venerable</i> refers to someone high up in a religion, usually Christian. In fact, Saint Bede, who is sometimes called the Father of English History, is often referred to as Bede the Venerable.</p></div>`;
