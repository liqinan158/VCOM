If you have a knack for <i>rhyme,</i> you might have a bright future as a poet.</p><p class="long">“True wit is nature to advantage dress'd; / What oft was thought, but ne'er so well express'd”: lines of rhyme written by English poet Alexander Pope.  The way “dress’d” and “express’d” sound, that’s rhyme.  <i>Rhyme</i> shares the same Latin root as <i>rhythm</i>, and poetry that rhymes does have a rhythm to it, like in a song.  <i>Rhyme</i> is a noun for similar sounds or a poem that uses rhyme, and it’s also a verb, like saying, “What rhymes with orange?”</p></div></div>`;
