Originally, this was a type of ghost.</p><p class="long">The word <i>doppelganger</i> is German and literally means double walker â€” as in a ghost or shadow of yourself. An easy way to remember it is that <i>doppelganger</i> sounds like double, as in "That movie star is my double. We look so much alike." These days, most people don't refer to the ghost meaning when talking about doppelgangers: they just mean someone who looks a lot like you or could be your twin. Still, that is pretty spooky.</p></div>`;
