If someone is writing a history of one battle of the Civil War, they might attempt a <i>necrology</i> of every soldier who died.</p><p class="long">If the newspaper publishes a list of passengers who died in a plane crash, you can call it a necrology. And the obituary, or death notice, of your great grandfather who died at the age of 110, can also be called a necrology â€” although <i>obituary</i> is much more common. <i>Necrology</i> was used more often in the eighteenth century, and it comes from <i>necro-</i>, "death," from the Greek <i>nekros</i>, "corpse."</p></div></div>`;
