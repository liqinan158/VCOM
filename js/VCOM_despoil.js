You may spoil a dinner party by being late, but we all <i>despoil</i> the earth with pollution and over-consumption.</p><p class="long">The Latin root of <i>despoil</i> meant "to strip or rob" and although <i>despoil</i> is used more broadly now, it has that sense within it. When we despoil the earth, we rob it of its beauty and strip it of its natural resources. In the same way, an invading army might despoil a village, wrecking houses and stealing valuables.</p></div></div>`;
