On a map, you can see that a traffic circle or roundabout consists of <i>radial</i> streets extending out from the center.</p><p class="long">A radius is a line from the center of a circle to its edge, or circumference. The adjective <i>radial</i> describes anything that acts as a radius or resembles one â€” often something radial is literally a line sticking straight out from a center point. Radial tires are designed so that each individual rubber cord making up the tire's surface lies in a radial direction from the middle of the tire. In Latin, <i>radius</i> means "shaft" or "spoke of a wheel."</p></div></div>`;
