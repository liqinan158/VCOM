Stories about <i>demons</i> are featured in a variety of different religious traditions.</p><p class="long">You might come across a demon in a supernatural fairy tale, or even in the Christian Bible. Demons are often interchangeable with devils, and both words are sometimes used to talk about a cruel, fiendish person. If you're extremely good at something, you also might be described as a <i>demon</i>: "She's a <i>demon</i> at bowling." The Greek root, <i>daimon</i>, doesn't have the same negative connotations â€” it means "spirit or deity."</p></div></div>`;
