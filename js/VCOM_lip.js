If you say that something is "on everyone's <i>lips</i>," you mean that it's the topic everyone seems to be talking about lately. If an angry teacher says, "Don't give me any <i>lip</i>!" he means "Don't be a smart mouth," or "Don't be impertinent." When you manage to keep a "stiff upper <i>lip</i>," you stay brave even when things get difficult.</p></div></div>`;
