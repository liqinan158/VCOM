You can call yourself an <i>Inmate</i> if you get sent to your room, but usually <i>inmates</i> are behind bars in "the big house."</p><p class="long">You can talk about a hospital inmate or the inmates at a local boarding school, but it's most common to use <i>inmate</i> and <i>prisoner</i> interchangeably. Originally, in the 16th century, an inmate was "one allowed to live in a house rented by another" â€” a roommate who's not on the lease, in other words. This meaning comes from <i>in</i> and <i>mate</i>, "friend or companion." By the 1830s, <i>inmate</i> had come to mean "one confined to an institution."</p></div>`;
