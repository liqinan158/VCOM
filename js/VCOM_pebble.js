If you want a pet rock, a smooth <i>pebble</i> would be a good choice.</p><p class="long">A pebble beach might not be quite as soft underfoot as a sandy one, but pebbles tend to be smooth and rounded â€” unlike jagged-edged rocks. A beach covered with smooth pebbles is known as a "shingle beach." The origin of the word <i>pebble</i> is a mystery, although some suspect a connection to the Latin <i>papula</i>, "pustule, pimple, or swelling."</p></div></div>`;
