It could be a remote piece of land or a new field of study, but if someone calls it "the <i>frontier</i>," you are challenged to explore it.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>frontier</i> has several meanings. It can refer to the wilderness at the edge of a settled area (picture covered wagons pushing westward) or it can mean a field of study that has not yet been explored (picture genetically engineering pet dinosaurs). Deriving from "the front line of an army," a frontier can be thought of as an offensive line in a battle â€” always pushing forward, trying to conquer new territory.</p></div></div>`;
