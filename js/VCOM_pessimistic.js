A <i>pessimistic</i> attitude isn't very hopeful, shows little optimism, and can be a downer for everyone else.</p><p class="long">To be <i>pessimistic</i> means you believe evil outweighs the good and that bad things are more likely to happen. So pessimistic people are usually pretty negative. And kind of a bummer to be around. Think of Eeyore, Winnie the Pooh's perpetually gloomy friend. The word comes to us, not surprisingly, from the Latin <i>pessimus</i> â€” meaning "worst."</p></div>`;
