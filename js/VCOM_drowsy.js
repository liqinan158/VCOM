When you’re sitting in the warm sunlight after a big lunch, and you’re so <i>drowsy</i> you can’t keep your eyes open, it’s not the right time to try organizing your desk.</p><p class="long">Ah <i>drowsy</i>, a word that describes slow-moving lions and charming little towns equally well. It has a  pleasant association to it, a nice cozy sleepiness, like the sort of feeling you have when you can’t exactly figure out why your eyes keep closing, they just do. Wine makes some people drowsy and a boring documentary will definitely do it to you. <i>Drowsy</i> comes from an Old English word meaning "falling," and has evolved into falling asleep.</p></div></div>`;
