When you use this adverb in this particular way, it means "in an unknown way or for an unknown reason." So your pal knows you changed something, but he can't quite figure out what it is. When <i>somehow</i> first appeared in print, around 1660, it was in the phrase "<i>somehow</i> or other."</p></div></div>`;
