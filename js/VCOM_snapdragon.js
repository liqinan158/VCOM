When you squeeze the sides of a snapdragon flower, the "mouth" opens and closes, making it a fun plant for kids. As a garden plant name, <i>snapdragon</i> dates from the 16th century. In the 18th century, it was also the name of a game (now obsolete) that involved eating raisins after snatching them out of burning brandy.</p></div></div>`;
