If you are stranded on a deserted island and you see a ship in the distance, it’s a good idea to <i>flail</i> your arms in the air to get the captain’s attention.</p><p class="long"><i>Flail</i> originates with the Latin word <i>flagellum</i>, which is a whip. It is also related to the noun <i>flail</i>, a stick with a swinging attachment to it, used to thresh grain. As a verb, it most often refers to arms, but can also involve the whole body, especially if someone is a very wild dancer. Other things can flail as well. If someone admits that his business is flailing, it’s probably lacking direction and not doing very well.</p></div>`;
