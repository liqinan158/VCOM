A <i>patina</i> can appear on anything made of metal.</p><p class="long">A <i>patina</i> can also be the shiny surface on wooden furniture that you get after years and years of polishing. You can also use the word in a metaphorical sense, to describe somebody who has acquired some surface character that doesn't go very deep â€” like the tycoon who has a <i>patina</i> of sophistication but only pretends to be interested in art and literature.</p></div>`;
