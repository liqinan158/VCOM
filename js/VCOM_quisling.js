Quisling was tried for treason and executed at the end of the war, and his name became synonymous with traitor and collaborator. The word <i>quisling</i> is not commonly used in the United States, however, probably because the American term for a traitor is "Benedict Arnold," the name of a Revolutionary War turncoat.</p></div>`;
