If you had visions of a roomy office coming with your new promotion, guess again. The new <i>incommodious</i> space barely has room for a desk and a chair!</p><p class="long"><i>Incommodious</i> is made up of the Latin root words <i>in</i>, meaning "not," and <i>commodious</i> from <i>commodiosus</i>, meaning "useful or convenient." Because <i>commodious</i> in English has a meaning of roomy and spacious, <i>incommodious</i> sometimes takes the opposite meaning of small and cramped. However, <i>incommodious</i> can refer to anything that is inconvenient. You may have to make an incommodious trip to the dentist if you break a tooth.</p></div></div>`;
