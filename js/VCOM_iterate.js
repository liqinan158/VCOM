If you loved the high school drama club’s performance of the “Three Little Pigs,” encourage them to iterate the musical so you can see it again. And again.</p><p class="long"><i>Iterate</i> comes from the Latin word <i>iterare</i> for "do again, repeat.” <i>Iterate</i> is a transitive verb, so you have to iterate something. A successful play or concert will usually iterate a performance, so more people can see it. People often iterate a point, by repeating, they hope others will understand it better. Politicians often iterate key points. The word <i>reiterate</i> is more familiar, and means something very similar — to repeat something for emphasis.</p></div>`;
