It's a place where many vendors come together to sell handmade or vintage items. You might visit the <i>flea market</i> if you want to find an antique lamp for your bedroom.</p><p class="long">A marketplace that rents spaces to a variety of sellers is a flea market, also known as a <i>bazaar</i> or a swap meet. Flea markets can be indoors or outdoors. Some are open daily, others once a week or even just once or twice a year, and some of them include food vendors as well. If you collect and sell vintage clothes, you may want to rent space at a flea market. This term may stem from New York's 18th-century <i>Fly Market</i>.</p></div>`;
