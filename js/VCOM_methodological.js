var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">methodological</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Use the adjective <i>methodological</i> when you want to describe something that relates to the methods and practices of a certain discipline. As a doctor, you should always follow best <i>methodological</i> practices. If a patient has a headache, don't treat him for a sore foot or vice versa.</p><p class="long">The roots of the adjective <i>methodological</i> can be broken into parts. Working backwards, <i>-ical</i> means "of or pertaining to," <i>-ology</i> means "branch of knowledge," and <i>method</i> is from both the Latin and Greek words <i>methodus</i>, meaning "a way of teaching or scientific inquiry." If you don't limit the variables, your research may have poor methodology. If you want to look at genes in blue-eyed people, but you study green-eyed people as well, you will have methodological problems.</p></div></div>`;
