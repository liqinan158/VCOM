Very often <i>ideology</i> refers to a set of political beliefs or a set of ideas that characterize a particular culture.</p><p class="long">Capitalism, communism, socialism, and Marxism are ideologies. But not all <i>-ism</i> words are. Think: cronyism (a system of graft whereby friends unfairly help each other make money.) Our English noun is from French <i>idéologie.</i> The suffix <i>–logy</i>, used with many English words describing theories or doctrines, is from Greek <i>logos</i> "word, reason, speech, account."</p></div>`;
