"Our boss decided to <i>improvise</i> his speech at our company meeting and when he started going off-topic, everyone could tell he hadn't prepared in advance."</p><p class="long">Improvise comes from the Latin word <i>improvisus</i>, meaning "unforeseen, unexpected." Think about when something unexpected happens to you â€” you have no choice but to react in the moment, or <i>improvise</i>. Another meaning for <i>improvise</i> refers to acting onstage without a script. When actors <i>improvise</i> scenes for an audience, they create funny situations as they go, without having anything pre-planned. The Second City theater in Chicago made this type of comedy famous, with many well-known alumni like Tina Fey and Stephen Colbert.</p></div></div>`;
