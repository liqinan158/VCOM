It describes anything that comes from nature, but it also means "inborn" when you describe your basketball-star friend as a natural athlete. You can also use it to talk about someone being at ease  ("he tried to act <i>natural</i> when the police passed by") or to mean "inevitable," as when you say, "It's only <i>natural</i> that those two ended up getting married."</p></div>`;
