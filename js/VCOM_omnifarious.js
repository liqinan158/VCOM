You might recognize the Latin prefix <i>omni-</i> from other words that have the notion of "all" or "every." The <i>-farious</i> part, Latin for "part or parts," is the same one you see in <i>multifarious</i>, an adjective that is more common than <i>omnifarious</i> and has roughly the same meaning.</p></div>`;
