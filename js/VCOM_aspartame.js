If you're avoiding sugar, you might try adding <i>aspartame</i> to your coffee.</p><p class="long">Aspartame may sound like asparagus, but it's much sweeter: super sweet, in fact. The main purpose of aspartame is to sweeten things as an alternative to sugar. Since aspartame has no calories, that's attractive to people trying to lose weight. People with conditions such as diabetes also need to avoid sugar. Aspartame is found in sugar substitutes at the coffee shop as well as in many diet foods and drinks. Just how healthy aspartame is remains a subject for debate.</p></div></div>`;
