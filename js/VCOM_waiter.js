If you discover an insect in your gazpacho, you might call out, "<i>Waiter</i>! There's a fly in my soup!"</p><p class="long">These days it's more common to call the cafe worker who takes your order and delivers your nachos a <i>server</i>, since it's entirely gender-neutral, but some people still use <i>waiter</i> for a man or woman and <i>waitress</i> for a woman. Your grandpa might enjoy embarrassing the whole family by hollering, "Check please, waiter!" at the end of every restaurant meal. Before this word became common for restaurant servers, it was used for household servants who "waited at table."</p></div></div>`;
