Wow, this is quite a dilemma. What to do, what to do? Hmmm. Looks like this moment itself is a <i>quandary</i>: a tough situation that will be really hard to resolve.</p><p class="long">If you’re uncertain what to do because all of your options seem unpleasant, you’re probably in a quandary. Some voters find themselves in a quandary when they dislike all of the candidates. A more common quandary is when you plan two events at the same time and can’t decide which one to attend. Some synonyms are <i>predicament</i>, <i>dilemma</i>, <i>plight</i>, and <i>pickle</i> — and choosing which word to use is a quandary in itself.</p></div></div>`;
