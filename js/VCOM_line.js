It might be the <i>line</i> you wait in at the market, or just a connection of two points.</p><p class="long">The original meaning of <i>line</i> came from the Latin word <i>linea</i>, or “linen thread.”  Your career is also your "<i>line</i> of work."  Since you're an engineer, you might say "that's not in my <i>line</i>" if you are asked to bake a cake.  A "pick-up <i>line</i>" is something you might hear from a person at a party who's flirting with you.  It will probably be corny.</p></div>`;
