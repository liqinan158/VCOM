If you go along with your friends' idea to jump off a moving hayride together, you're a victim of <i>groupthink</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>groupthink</i> is most commonly used in an office or business context. This phenomenon occurs when people who like and trust each other go along with an idea without stopping to think it through critically. It first appeared in <i>Fortune</i> magazine in 1952, inspired by George Orwell's <i>1984</i> and its terms like "doublethink." Today groupthink is considered a psychological phenomenon that occurs when conforming to a group feels more important than reason and rationality.</p></div></div>`;
