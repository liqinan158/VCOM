var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">someone</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The word <i>someone</i> refers a person or an individual, but not necessarily a specific one. If you're not hungry enough for dessert after lunch, you can ask the friends at your table, "Does <i>someone</i> want my ice cream sandwich?"</p><p class="long">It's a funny contradiction, but the noun <i>someone</i> can be used to mean "any unspecified person," but also "a very important person." So a child might say, "When I grow up, I want to be <i>someone</i>," meaning that they want to be well-known or famous, or just really good at something. <i>Someone</i> and <i>somebody</i> are synonyms, so you can use them interchangeably, although <i>someone</i> is slightly more formal.</p></div></div>`;
