It's hard sometimes to tell if politicians run for office in order to help their communities, or just for their own <i>aggrandizement</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Aggrandizement</i> is the noun form of the verb <i>aggrandize</i>, "to increase the power or reputation of something," and it usually implies that there's some exaggeration going on. If your friend spread the story of how you had saved a drowning child at the beach, when actually you'd only yelled for the lifeguard, and if you didn't correct him or set the story straight, you'd be participating in the aggrandizement of your reputation.</p></div>`;
