A figurative <i>roadblock</i> is any situation you encounter that makes it difficult or impossible to do what you want or need to do.</p><p class="long">When a driver encounters a roadblock, she has to stop and go back, or to take a detour and use a different route. This sort of roadblock might be set up to divert cars away from construction or an accident. Other roadblocks are obstructions to progress, like a lawsuit that halts construction on a building or the high cost of something: "The price of converting to a solar water heater was a <i>roadblock</i> to our plans."</p></div>`;
