Caterpillars, on their way to becoming butterflies, display a great deal of <i>mutability</i>.</p><p class="long">An easy way to remember <i>mutability</i> is to think about a word it sounds like, <i>mutant</i>. A mutant is someone who has been changed, irrevocably, so <i>mutability</i> is the ability to change.  It's the mutability of the Internet that makes it so wonderful and confusing at the same time. You might tell your friend who was sweet and kind yesterday, but is mean and awful today, that you wish she didn't have such a tendency to mutability.</p></div></div>`;
