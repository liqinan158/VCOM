If you dream of backpacking through Europe and then taking a quick spin through southeast Asia, you have <i>wanderlust</i>.</p><p class="long">The Germans call the strong urge for travel <i>wanderlust</i>, literally a desire for wandering. We loved the German efficiency of the word so much we annexed it for our own language. With a word like <i>lust</i> inside it, <i>wanderlust</i> really captures the dreamy passion travelers all share. Sometimes the word is also used for people who can't make a commitment to a job or a relationship.</p></div>`;
