Although the word relates to healing or soothing, <i>therapeutic</i> isn’t reserved only for drugs or medical treatments. You’ve probably heard particular activities referred to as <i>therapeutic</i>, which just means that doing that activity makes you feel rejuvenated. You might consider shopping for shoes, for example, to be a therapeutic activity — at least until the credit card bill arrives.</p></div></div>`;
