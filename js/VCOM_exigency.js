The very word conjures up danger and intrigue that demand a cool head and an immediate effort at a solution.</p><p class="long">The meaning of <i>exigency</i> is obvious from its source, the Latin noun <i>exigentia</i>, which means "urgency" and comes from the verb <i>exigere</i>, meaning "to demand or require." An emergency situation, or  exigency, is urgent and demands immediate action. Our lives are filled with exigencies, both large and small, from a child stuck in a tree to lightning striking your house to catastrophic river flooding. Each is an exigency â€” it's all a matter of perspective.</p></div>`;
