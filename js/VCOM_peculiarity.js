You might be self conscious about the fact that your ears are uneven, something you think of as an obvious peculiarity. Another kind of peculiarity is a quality that is specific to someone or something: "One <i>peculiarity</i> of people from the Midwest is that they call soda <i>pop</i>." This "special characteristic" meaning is the original one, which makes sense given the Latin root, <i>peculiaris</i>, "of one's own."</p></div></div>`;
