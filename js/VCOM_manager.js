var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">manager</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">It makes sense that a <i>manager</i> is someone who "manages," or takes charge of something. A baseball team <i>manager</i> is in charge of running the team, while a business <i>manager</i> oversees finances, scheduling, and the everyday operation of the business.</p><p class="long">The probable origin of the word <i>manager</i> comes from the Latin <i>manus</i>, meaning "hand." A good manager provides the necessary "hand," guiding others. The Italian <i>maneggiare</i> means "to control," and was especially used with reference to training horses, a job for which certain managers you've worked for might be better suited.  The word extends beyond human beings as well: the file manager on your computer is a program designed to organize data.</p></div>`;
