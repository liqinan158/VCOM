If you are diving for sunken treasure you will be <i>amazed</i> to discover a wreck filled with gold bars, unless the gold in those bars turn out to be paint, in which case your amazement will quickly turn to disappointment.</p><p class="long"><i>Amazed</i> means being astounded or filled with wonder. It's the kind of reaction you'd expect from an audience at a magic show, although it takes a lot more sophisticated magic to amaze audiences today than it did decades ago. Back in the 1930s, if a magician had pulled a rabbit out of a hat you would definitely have been amazed. Today, you would have to see a magician make a rabbit levitate, disappear, and reappear in the form of a tiger to get an amazed reaction.</p></div>`;
