If you go skating on a frozen lake and it cracks, in <i>hindsight</i> you'd know you should've paid attention to the giant "danger" sign.</p><p class="long"><i>Hindsight</i> is like looking behind you to see what just happened (be<i>hind</i> sight, get it?). Another way of describing retrospection, hindsight is a useful skill that can be cultivated. <i>Hindsight</i> often refers to a lesson learned from something going wrong. Billy Wilder, the American movie director, once commented wistfully, “Hindsight is always twenty-twenty.” It's much easier to see clearly after something happened than before.</p></div>`;
