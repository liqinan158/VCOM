If you <i>jovially</i> introduce yourself to the new kid in school, it will make her feel welcome.</p><p class="long">Imagine Santa Claus laughing jovially: "Ho ho ho!" This adverb implies happiness and mirth, but also a friendly openness. A party where everyone is talking jovially is much more fun than a party where guests are standing quietly, looking at their phones. <i>Jovially</i> comes from a root meaning "pertaining to the planet Jupiter," and the astrological belief that Jupiter brings happiness to those "born under it."</p></div></div>`;
