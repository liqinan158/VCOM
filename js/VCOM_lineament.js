He was basically saying that a particular woman's face looked a lot like his own face, when he examined each part of it — each lineament — separately. The word comes from the Latin word <i>linea</i>, meaning "line." <i>Lineaments</i> can also refer to someone's distinctive features, not just their looks.</p></div>`;
