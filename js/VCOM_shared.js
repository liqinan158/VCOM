You can describe the people both you and your sister know well as your <i>shared</i> friends.</p><p class="long">Things that are shared are mutual â€” or jointly owned. A shared car is used by more than one person, all of whom can drive it and are responsible for buying gas and paying for insurance. If you sit at a big, shared table in a restaurant, you'll probably be seated next to people you don't know. <i>Shared</i> has an Old English origin, the word <i>scearu</i>, or "division, part into which something is divided," from a Germanic root word.</p></div>`;
