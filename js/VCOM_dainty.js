More often, <i>dainty</i> is used as an adjective to describe something that's delicate and lovely. It's a compliment, unless it's used sarcastically to mean "someone who acts ridiculously prissy." An example would be to say, "Sorry I hurt you when I barely brushed against you. I didn't realize you were so <i>dainty</i>."</p></div>`;
