When you describe someone as <i>libidinous</i>, it's usually not a compliment, since the word suggests being out of control with lust and desire.</p><p class="long">The word <i>libidinous</i> comes from the Latin word <i>libido</i>, meaning "desire," a word the world relearned from Sigmund Freud in the early 1900s. Freud believed that the libido is one of the powerful motivating forces for people and that psychological health is determined by how well a person controls and focuses it.</p></div>`;
