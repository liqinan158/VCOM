In fact, the term <i>to court</i>, as in to woo someone romantically, comes from the origin. A similar term is <i>concubine</i>, though it has a slightly different meaning. Concubines date from earlier times, to the Biblical era and beyond, and refer to woman who were generally kept far more closeted socially, unlike courtesans, who often had great independence and freedom.
