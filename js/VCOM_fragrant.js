What makes a smell nice is subjective, or course. You might find a bowl of dried lavender to be <i>fragrant</i>, but your dog might prefer a pile of horse poop.</p><p class="long"><i>Fragrant</i> things emit good smells, like flowers, trees, or cooking. Maybe you find fresh cut grass fragrant, or the smell of summer rain on asphalt. When a smell gets too intense, however, it loses its <i>fragrancy</i>. Someone doused in cologne has bypassed fragrancy for noxiousness. But heâ€™s right on one count: the people we are attracted to are almost always fragrant to us.</p></div></div>`;
