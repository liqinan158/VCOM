Many high school students use lockers that can be locked with <i>padlocks</i> to keep their smelly gym clothes safe.</p><p class="long">A padlock's hook or shackle is hinged so that it can fasten through an opening, clicking shut securely. Most padlocks require a key to open them, while others use a combination, a series of wheels that you turn and align to show a certain password before the padlock will open. You can use <i>padlock</i> as a verb, too: "Be sure to <i>padlock</i> the back gate when you leave!"</p></div>`;
