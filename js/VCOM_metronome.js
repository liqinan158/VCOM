Well, that was a <i>metronome,</i> a device that helps musicians keep to the tempo of the music.</p><p class="long">The metronome was invented in 1815 by a German engineer called Johann Maelzel, who was good friends with Beethoven. They even performed together, with Maelzel giving demonstrations of his device in the intervals. The metronome has come in for some criticism, but if it was good enough for Beethoven, it's probably good enough for you. The name comes from the Greek words <i>metron</i> for "measure," and <i>nomus</i> for "regulating."</p></div></div>`;
