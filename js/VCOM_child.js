As a <i>child</i>, you probably had your parents watching over you as you played in a sandbox.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>child</i> come from the Old English word <i>cild</i>, meaning "child, infant."  Retaining a similar meaning into modern times, the word still refers to a young person, male or female. But you can be considered a child after reaching adulthood â€” in the eyes of your parents, at least. Immature behavior like throwing a temper tantrum can also mark you as a child. The word can also refer to someone in a clan or tribe, young or old.</p></div></div>`;
