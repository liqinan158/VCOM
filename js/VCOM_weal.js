Don't pick up that hot pan without an oven mitt â€” it will burn you and leave a red <i>weal</i> on your hand.</p><p class="long">Think of a weal as the painful-looking mark left after someone is slapped hard. "My sister claimed she didn't smack me with the dog's leash, but the weal on my cheek gave her away." In medicine, the word also means an itchy, raised rash: "The weals on his neck make me think he's allergic to cats." The root of <i>weal</i> means "raised ridge or line." An older meaning of the word, from a different source, was "well-being."</p></div></div>`;
