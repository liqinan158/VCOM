The noun <i>torment</i> is the result of the verb <i>torment</i>.</p><p class="long">After stealing the old lady's purse, you might expect to be <i>tormented</i> by many sleepless nights. Those nights without sleep will <i>torment</i> (tor-MENT) you. They are your <i>torment</i> (TOR-ment). Perhaps you shouldn't have done that. You'll doubtless notice the relationship between <i>torture</i> and <i>torment</i>. But the subtle difference between them is that to torment someone is to torture them repeatedly. Often this is used metaphorically. For example, calling someone over and over to demand payment isn't actually torture, but it's certainly a way to torment them.</p></div></div>`;
