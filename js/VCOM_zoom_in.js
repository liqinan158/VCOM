You probably tend to zoom in on things that interest you, whether they're particular colors in oil paintings or strange looking birds perched in trees. The phrase comes from what a photographer does with a telephoto or <i>zoom</i> lens. She can adjust the camera's focus to see small or far away things up close: in other words, she zooms in on them.</p></div>`;
