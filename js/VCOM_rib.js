Your <i>ribs</i> protect your internal organs. A <i>rib</i> is also the curved bone in a pig’s chest, and some people eat that with barbeque sauce.</p><p class="long">Ribs are strong and flexible, and they form a kind of protective cage around our soft inside parts. Animals have ribs, too — fish even have two sets of ribs. If you're a meat eater, you probably know that pigs and cows have ribs that are a popular menu item at barbecue restaurants. Things that resemble anatomical ribs, like raised rows in a knitted garment — are also called ribs. And to <i>rib</i> someone is to tease them.</p></div></div>`;
