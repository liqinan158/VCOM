You might apply for a job as a personal assistant, only to realize during the interview that it's really a job as a <i>flunky</i>.</p><p class="long">A flunky's job is to do whatever he or she is told to do, preferably without question, in a docile, dutiful way. A mob boss or other criminal mastermind might send flunkies out to do his dirty work, while in the old days a typical flunky was a footman or butler â€” a servant. This meaning comes from the Scottish <i>flunkey</i>, meaning "footman or liveried servant."</p></div></div>`;
