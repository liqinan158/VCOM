First you notice the word <i>unique</i>, which means “one of a kind.” Then you notice <i>-ness</i>, a common suffix that’s used to form nouns that refer to a state of being. Put it together and you get <i>uniqueness</i>, a noun used to describe that certain something that makes a person or thing uncommon or singular, like "the <i>uniqueness</i> of a famous opera singer’s voice."</p></div></div>`;
