If you enter a pie eating contest when you're already full, you'll probably have to end up in a state of <i>capitulation</i>.</p><p class="long">The original meaning of <i>capitulation</i> is "the formal terms of surrender between governments." The word comes from the Latin <i>capitulƒÅre</i>, with a root in <i>capital</i>, or "the head of state." You can use <i>capitulation</i> for any act of surrender. If you're stuck in an endless argument with your neighbor over the exact boundary between your properties, only the original deeds to the land will bring about a capitulation.</p></div>`;
