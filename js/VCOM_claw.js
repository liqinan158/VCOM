It could be a lobster <i>claw</i> or even an ambitious worker <i>clawing</i> his way up the corporate ladder.</p><p class="long">As a noun, a <i>claw</i> is the pointy finger-like grabbers that birds, insects, and some lizards and mammals have. Machines can have claws too, and maybe you’ve seen the game at an arcade where you make a metal claw pick up a toy. <i>Claw</i> can be a verb as well, meaning to grab, scratch, or pull in a painful and jolting way. Should someone bury you up to your neck in a hole, you’ll have to claw your way out. And you can accidentally claw your date if you grab her arm during a scary movie.</p></div></div>`;
