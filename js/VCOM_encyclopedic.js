If your knowledge about any subject is encyclopedic, it means you know as much about it as an encyclopedia — a book crammed full of information — could tell you. In fact, <i>encyclopedic</i> comes from <i>encyclopedia</i>, a modern Latin word that's based on a misreading of the Greek <i>enkyklios paideia</i> as "general education." The phrase actually means "training in a circle."</p></div></div>`;
