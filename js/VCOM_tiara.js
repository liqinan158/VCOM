Your little sister might wear a <i>tiara</i> on her birthday â€” or just for fun.</p><p class="long">The words <i>tiara</i> and <i>diadem</i> are used interchangeably for decorative crowns that have historically been worn by high-status people. The word <i>tiara</i> comes from a Persian root, and was originally used specifically to mean "headdress of Persian kings." Today you're most likely to spot tiaras gracing the heads of cartoon princesses like Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty.</p></div></div>`;
