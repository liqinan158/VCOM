Many women consider chivalry a lost art.  Nice work, fellas.</p><p class="long"><i>Cavalry</i> (soldiers on horseback) and <i>chivalry</i> have the same root: the Medieval Latin word <i>caballarius,</i> meaning "horseman" or "knight." In the Middle Ages, a knight was expected to be brave, loyal, and to open the tavern door for his date. Picture a knight kneeling before a maiden and kissing her hand. It's a classic image of chivalry from the storybooks. Some women wonder whether chivalry has ever existed anywhere else.</p></div>`;
