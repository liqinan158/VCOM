I don't think we can finish this without a <i>facilitator</i> to guide us through the final phase.</p><p class="long">Many Romance languages have a word descended from the Latin <i>facile</i>, "easy." If you're familiar with any of those, then <i>facilitator</i> will be easy for you to remember. All sorts of people need someone to who makes a process easier. During a negotiation, for example, the parties may call in a facilitator to help iron out their differences. If you've got a friend who can't seem to get their physics homework done, you can be a facilitator just by holding their hand through the toughest problem sets.</p></div></div>`;
