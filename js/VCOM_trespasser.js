A <i>trespasser</i> is someone who enters another person's property without an invitation.</p><p class="long">Trespassing is a crime, so a trespasser can find herself in a lot of trouble. As a legal term, <i>trespasser</i> implies that the person has intentionally and knowingly entered private property. So if you trip and fall and find yourself tumbling down a hill into your neighbor's garden, you are not a trespasser. If you stand up, brush yourself off, and enter your neighbor's house to watch their TV, you are a trespasser.</p></div></div>`;
