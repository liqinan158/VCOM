A little boy wearing his mom's shoes will <i>clomp</i> around the kitchen enjoying the sound he makes.</p><p class="long">People in work boots clomp around, and horses walking on a paved street also tend to clomp. If you leave your snowshoes on when you enter a quiet yoga studio, you'll be embarrassed at how loudly you clomp down the hall. Since the 1800's, <i>clomp</i> has been used to mean "to walk as with clogs." It's thought to be a variation on the word <i>clump</i>, which can mean "a lump of something," but also means "the sound of heavy footsteps."</p></div></div>`;
