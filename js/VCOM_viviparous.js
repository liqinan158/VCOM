That means you were born to a <i>viviparous</i> mother. The adjective <i>viviparous</i> describes something that gives birth to living things, rather than eggs.</p><p class="long">Breaking <i>viviparous</i> down into parts can help you understand its meaning. <i>Vivi</i> looks a lot like <i>vivus</i>, Latin for "alive." <i>Parous</i> comes from the Latin word <i>parere</i>, meaning "produce, bring forth, give birth to." To pronounce it correctly, say "VIE-vip-uh-rus." Then say "thank you" to your mother.</p></div>`;
