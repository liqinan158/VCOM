Liquids go right through things that have <i>porosity</i>.</p><p class="long">Go back far enough and you’ll find that <i>porosity</i> stems from the Greek word <i>poros</i> for "pore," which means “passage.” So something with porosity lets things through. Most pants have porosity, as you unfortunately notice when you spill soup on them — the soup goes right through. On the other hand, a raincoat has no porosity because it's waterproof. If your roof is leaking during the rain, it has some porosity, which is a problem. You can remember porosity by imagining liquids pouring through things.</p></div></div>`;
