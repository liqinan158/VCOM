I know you're feeling sea sick, but if our boat sinks, <i>nausea</i> will be the least of your problems.</p><p class="long"><i>Nausea</i> gets its root from the Greek word for ship, <i>naus</i>, so it might have originally meant sea sickness in particular.  Remembering this origin might help you spell <i>nausea</i> correctly too, since it ends with “sea.”  But nausea can strike on dry land just as well, from eating the wrong thing, catching the flu, reading on a moving bus . . . just thinking of it all makes me sick to my stomach.</p></div>`;
