Many people believe that a <i>tarot</i> reading will give them special insight into the future â€” but other people believe that fortune telling is bunk.</p><p class="long">A deck of tarot cards has four suits, usually swords, cups, coins, and wands, plus 21 trump cards. These cards include The Fool, The Lovers, Death, and Justice. During a tarot reading, cards are dealt from a shuffled deck and placed in a certain pattern. The placement and order of each card gives it a specific significance and meaning. Beyond its Italian source, the origin of the word <i>tarot</i> remains a mystery.</p></div></div>`;
