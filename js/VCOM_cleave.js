It can describe cutting or splitting something apart with a sharp instrument, or — oddly enough — it can describe sticking to something like glue.</p><p class="long">To cleave or not to cleave, that is the question.  <i>Cleave</i> can refer to being in close contact, to staying really, really close to someone or something: "If you are walking in the pitch-black woods without a flashlight, you want to cleave to the person in front of you."  On the other hand, it can mean to split apart with a sharp tool — which is not the action you want to happen while walking in the woods. We've seen that movie.</p></div>`;
