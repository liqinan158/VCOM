The word <i>tee</i> is also used more generally for the area of a golf course where you begin a match.</p><p class="long">Other sports that use a tee include tee ball, American football, and rugbyâ€”each of these tees is significantly larger than a golf tee. As a verb, <i>tee</i> means "hit off of a <i>tee</i>," and in golf you "<i>tee</i> off" when play begins. Besides its Scottish origin, not much is known about where this word comes from. Informally, when you're teed off at someone, you're really angry.</p></div></div>`;
