var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">therefore</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The adverb <i>therefore</i> means as a result or consequence, or "for that reason." Cats and dogs tend to fight; <i>therefore</i>, keep your pets apart at night if you want to get some sleep.</p><p class="long">The adverb <i>therefore</i> is also used to introduce a conclusion that follows based on logic. You'll see this construction a lot in logic, math, and science, for example. Of course, sometimes the conclusions are false, as in this argument: "All fish live in water. A whale lives in water. <i>Therefore</i>, a whale is a fish." A whale is, in fact, a mammal. Therefore, the argument that a whale is a fish is wrong.</p></div>`;
