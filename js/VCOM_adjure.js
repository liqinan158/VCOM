For example, you might have to <i>adjure</i> someone to tell the truth.</p><p class="long">You get a strong sense of the word <i>adjure</i> when you realize that the <i>jure</i> part is similar to "jury." Both come from the Latin <i>j큰r훮re</i> "swear," which in turn comes from <i>j큰s, j큰r-</i> "law" (as in <i>justice</i> and <i>jurist</i>). In 14th-century Middle English, the word suggested someone affirming something by swearing with an oath. So <i>adjure</i> means to command solemnly, as in "She <i>adjured</i> him to present the events precisely as he witnessed them."</p></div></div>`;
