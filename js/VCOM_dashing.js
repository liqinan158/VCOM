var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">dashing</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Someone who's <i>dashing</i> is stylish, with a certain bold, attractive spirit. Your <i>dashing</i> uncle might charm and impress your friends with his stories of travels around the world and his fashionable outfits.</p><p class="long">Characters in old books are frequently dashing â€” adventurous and gallant, like a dashing hero on a white horse or a dashing pirate seeking his fortune at sea. The adjective <i>dashing</i> is almost always used to describe men, and for that reason it's a bit old-fashioned. In the 18th and 19th centuries "to cut a dash" meant "to act brilliantly" or "to give a showy appearance," and <i>dashing</i> came from this meaning.</p></div>`;
