Some psychologists believe your <i>anima</i> affects your dreams, fears, and habits.</p><p class="long">Psychologist Carl Jung came up with the ideas of <i>anima</i> and <i>animus</i>, parts of your psyche — or spirit — that connect with the deepest, most subconscious aspects of the mind. Originally, Jung used <i>anima</i> to talk about the feminine parts of a man's personality. The Latin origin of the word is <i>animus</i>, "rational soul, life, or intelligence," from a root that means "to blow" or "to breathe."</p></div>`;
