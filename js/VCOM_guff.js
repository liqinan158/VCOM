You might dismiss a controversial article by calling it a bunch of <i>guff</i>.</p><p class="long">Sometimes <i>guff</i> is defined as "lies," but it can also be simply ridiculous ideas or speech. Your teacher might dismiss your excuse for being late to class by saying, "That story's just a bunch of <i>guff</i>!" The informal <i>guff</i> gets its sense of "empty talk" from its original meaning, "puff of air." An unrelated but interesting kind of <i>guff</i> is the Scottish meaning, "an unpleasant smell."</p></div></div>`;
