One way to <i>misbehave</i> would be to stand on the roof of your house and throw water balloons at people walking by.</p><p class="long">Kids are probably most often said to misbehave, although adults misbehave at least as often. A bank executive, for example, might misbehave by embezzling money, and a politician misbehaves when she lies under oath. The meaning of the word is clear once you know that the prefix <i>mis-</i> means "bad or wrong," from Old English. When you combine it with <i>behave</i>, you get bad behavior.</p></div>`;
