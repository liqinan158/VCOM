How do you pet a <i>porcupine</i>? Very, very carefully.</p><p class="long"><i>Porcupine</i> comes from Latin roots, <i>porcus</i>, "pig," and <i>spina</i>, "spine or quill." Fittingly, a regional name for the porcupine is "quill pig." The porcupine is famous for its spines, which become spikier when it's afraid or angry. Less well known is the fact that porcupines also clatter their teeth loudly as a warning â€” all the more reason for your dog to feel embarrassed after she ends up with a nose full of porcupine quills.</p></div>`;
