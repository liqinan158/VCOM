But novellas? They're not as well known, but pretty simple: nothing more than short novels. Sometimes novellas are called <i>novelettes</i>, but whatever you call them, you'll probably read a few in English class. Sometimes it's easier to squeeze in a novella than a whole novel, so maybe you could start with Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" or Franz Kafka's "Metamorphosis."</p></div>`;
