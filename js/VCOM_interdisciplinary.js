If you take an <i>interdisciplinary</i> science and literature class, you might read a science fiction novel and then explore the scientific ideas behind it.</p><p class="long">The word <i>interdisciplinary</i> can be broken into its parts: <i>inter-</i>, which means "between" in Latin, and <i>disciplinary</i>, which is from the Latin <i>disciplina</i> and means teaching or knowledge. <i>Interdisciplinary</i> means between fields, but they don't have to be unrelated disciplines. You can do interdisciplinary work between two sciences, for example. An <i>interdisciplinary</i> conference on biology and computer science might include workshops on both fields.</p></div></div>`;
