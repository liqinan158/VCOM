A <i>plutocratic</i> government puts all the power in the hands of those with large amounts of money.</p><p class="long"><i>Plutocratic</i> is often used in a disapproving way to talk about governments that allow people to essentially buy power and influence. An extremely wealthy person who uses their money to get elected is plutocratic, as is an official who accepts financial contributions and gives favors in return. When money is used this way, to influence policy and political appointments, the system is plutocratic. The Greek root, <i>ploutos</i>, means "wealth."</p></div>`;
