For example, your job might offer <i>paid</i> vacation, when you get your usual pay but don't have to work.</p><p class="long">Paid work is anything you do for pay, whether it's babysitting your cousin for ten dollars, or a job at a law firm that provides a weekly paycheck. When people are described as <i>paid</i>, it clarifies the fact that they're working for money â€” like a paid FBI informant, or a paid companion for an elderly man. <i>Paid</i> comes from the verb <i>pay</i>, which meant "pacify or please" long before it came to mean "give what is due."</p></div></div>`;
