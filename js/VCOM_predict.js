If you <i>predict</i> that you'll win the poker championship, you're either really confident in your poker skills or you're cheating.</p><p class="long">The prefix <i>pre</i> means "before." <i>Dict</i> comes from the Latin <i>dicere</i>, which means "to say," yet you can use <i>predict</i> to refer to things that can't say anything at all.  Darkening skies can predict a coming storm, for example, and a runny nose can predict a cold.   You can predict something based on factual evidence, or on a crystal-ball reading, or just on plain intuition.</p></div>`;
