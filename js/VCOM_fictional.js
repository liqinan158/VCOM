While <i>fictional</i> characters may be based loosely on real-life people, they never actually existed. In the movie "Citizen Kane," Orson Welles transformed the real newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst into the <i>fictional</i> Charles Foster Kane. Hearst never went around whispering "Rosebud."</p></div>`;
