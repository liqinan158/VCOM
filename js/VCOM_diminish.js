If you cover a lightbulb with a dark lamp shade, the light from the lamp will <i>diminish</i>.</p><p class="long">It can also mean become less important. Once the light has been dimmed, its role in lighting the room is diminished. If you look at <i>diminish</i>, you see 'minis' which comes from the Latin word <i>minus</i>, as in subtraction. Other words that share this root are miniature and minuscule, all of which mean something that is small, or at least smallish.</p></div>`;
