That's what someone might say when he or she needs to <i>recast</i> something, meaning "to make major changes that make something seem very different or even brand new."</p><p class="long">When you <i>recast</i> something, you aren’t just improving it slightly — something that is <i>recast</i> typically involves significant changes to the original.

When you recast a metal item, like a piece of jewelry, the item is melted down completely and then remade in a new form.
