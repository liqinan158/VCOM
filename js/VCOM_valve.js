Before you fix the broken sink in your bathroom, you should turn the <i>valve</i> that shuts off the water.</p><p class="long">The simplest type of valve has a hinged flap allowing liquid to flow one direction, but blocking it from going the other way. This is called a "check valve." Anatomical valves  — systems in your body that allow a flow of fluid, like the aortic valve near your heart  — are structured very much the same way. The shells of mollusks like oysters and clams are also called <i>valves</i>. The word's earliest meaning was "one half of a folding door."</p></div></div>`;
