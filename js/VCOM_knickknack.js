A <i>knickknack</i> isn’t valuable — except sentimentally.</p><p class="long">Little statues, candles in quirky shapes, or prizes found inside cereal boxes, are all knickknacks. Anything that decorates or clutters the shelves of someone's home, especially if it's basically worthless, is a knickknack. The word <i>knickknack</i> was originally a 16th century version of "dirty trick," from <i>knack</i>, and its now-obsolete meaning "deception or trick." Don’t freak out if it’s spelled <i>knick-knack</i> because that’s ok too.</p></div>`;
