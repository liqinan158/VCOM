var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">wrap</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>wrap</i> something is to enclose it, like when you <i>wrap</i> holiday presents in glittery paper. When you're done with the presents, you can <i>wrap</i> yourself in a cozy blanket while you drink hot chocolate.</p><p class="long"><i>Wrap</i> also has a number of noun meanings. There's the wrap you wear, which is similar to a cloak or a shawl. There's also the plastic wrap you use to cover a bowl of leftovers, and the wrap you make when you fold a tortilla around sandwich fillings. The verb <i>wrap</i> came first, from a root meaning "to turn or wind." To wrap something up also means to end it, so let's wrap up this blurb by saying, "That's a wrap!" â€” it's what movie directors since the 1920s have been saying when filming is finished.</p></div>`;
