Divisive things divide. That's why it's best to avoid potentially divisive topics like politics if you believe you are in the company of people who have differing opinions. Don't confuse <i>divisive</i> with <i>decisive</i>, which means "able to make decisions" and "unmistakable, beyond a doubt."</p></div></div>`;
