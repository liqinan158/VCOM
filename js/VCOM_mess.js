If you make a huge <i>mess</i> when you cook, you probably try to get someone else to do the clean-up.</p><p class="long">In addition to describing a jumble of stuff, <i>mess</i> can describe a confused or difficult situation, like the <i>mess</i> your finances are in if you have seven credit cards. When you mess something up, you cause disorder and maybe even wreck something, like a friendship you messed up by gossiping. And you might eat in a mess hall, a cafeteria for members of the armed forces â€” and it's probably very neat and orderly, not messy.</p></div>`;
