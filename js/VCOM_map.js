When your dad stops the car, sighs, and pulls out his <i>map</i>, you are probably lost.</p><p class="long">As more and more people rely on electronic devices to get directions, the art of reading a map is becoming lost.  A map can illustrate roads, stars in the galaxy, or even the genes in a human chromosome. When you map something, you sketch it or plan the route or steps you will take, like mapping out your future. A Latin root of <i>map</i> is <i>mappa</i>, or "napkin," as in something you'd sketch a map on.</p></div>`;
