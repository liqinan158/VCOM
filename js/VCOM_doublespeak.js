When a company "downsizes," that actually means a lot of people are losing their jobs.</p><p class="long">Instead of a blunt, straightforward word or phrase, doublespeak uses euphemisms and ambiguity to disguise or soften a message. Military leaders might refer to "servicing the target" when they mean dropping bombs, and a used car salesman most likely prefers describing older vehicles as "pre-owned." The word <i>doublespeak</i> comes from the George Orwell novel <i>1984</i> and is a cross between Orwell's terms <i>doublethink</i> and <i>Newspeak</i>.</p></div></div>`;
