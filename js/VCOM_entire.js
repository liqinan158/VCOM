Now think of that "all" as being whole — not broken or lacking in any way. Remember that, and you will have the <i>entire</i> meaning of the word.</p><p class="long"><i>Entire</i> is based on the Latin <i>integrum</i>, which came from the prefix <i>in-</i>, "not," and <i>tangere</i>, "to touch," and thus means "untouched." From there it developed into the 14th-century Old French <i>entier</i>, meaning "unbroken or complete," and then, through Middle English, into our modern word <i>entire</i>. One use of the word you don't see every day is to describe an uncastrated horse — an "<i>entire</i> horse" is a stallion. Gives a pretty interesting picture of the word, doesn't it?</p></div>`;
