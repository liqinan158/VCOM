When you <i>expound,</i> you explain or provide details.</p><p class="long"><i>Expound</i> came into English from a 14th-century French word <i>espondre</i> meaning "to elaborate" or "put forth." Often when you <i>expound</i> something you are clarifying or giving the particulars. A more formal way to <i>expound</i> is to offer <i>exposition</i>, often going line by line to explain precise meanings in a text or legal document.</p></div></div>`;
