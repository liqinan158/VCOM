The <i>loveseat</i> in your living room might be just the right size for you and your dog to share.</p><p class="long">Any sofa with two cushions, or that's approximately wide enough to seat two, is a loveseat. The very first loveseats appeared in the early 19th century, two-person couches that evolved from the wide upholstered seats for one that were popular in the 1700s, as they could accommodate the huge dresses that fashionable women wore. The loveseat gets its name from the idea that a couple can share it, sitting very close together.</p></div>`;
