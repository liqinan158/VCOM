It's not to be confused with a molehill.</p><p class="long">The word <i>mountain</i> has been around since the 1200s. A mountain is much larger than an average hill; it's a mass of land that rises up to 2000 feet or so. <i>Mountain</i> does not always describe a land mass. It can also be used to refer to an undertaking, a pile of something, or even a large dose of trouble. You might have a mountain of mashed potatoes you don't want to eat, or a mountain of homework.</p></div></div>`;
