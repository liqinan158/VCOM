A caterpillar is the <i>larval</i> form of a butterfly.</p><p class="long">In animals that take one form before metamorphosing into their adult shape, that first, immature stage is larval. The larval phase of a frog is a tadpole, and the larval form of a fly is a tiny, white, squirming maggot. You can also use this adjective in a figurative way, for the early stage of non-insects: "My novel is really still in its larval form. It's actually just a paragraph."</p></div></div>`;
