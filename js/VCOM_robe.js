Most <i>robes</i> tie around the waist with a fabric belt.</p><p class="long">There are dressier types of robes as well, like the ceremonial robes a judge wears in a courtroom or the elegant robes worn by a queen on a formal occasion. You can also use <i>robe</i> a verb, meaning "to dress or clothe," or literally "to put on a <i>robe</i>." <i>Robe</i> shares a Germanic root with <i>rob</i>, most likely from the idea that robbers would "take garments from the enemy as spoils or booty."</p></div>`;
