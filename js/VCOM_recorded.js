And unless it's a live event, the shows you watch on TV are recorded programs. When official notes are taken, they're recorded too: "This is the hottest summer in <i>recorded</i> history." The Latin root of <i>recorded</i> and the verb <i>record</i> is <i>recordari</i>, "remember by heart."</p></div>`;
