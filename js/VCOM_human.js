You can identify a <i>human</i> by the two legs it stands on, its upright stature, its high intelligence, and its speech that you'll understand if you're one, too.</p><p class="long"><i>Human</i> was first recorded in the mid 13th century, and owes its existence to the Middle French <i>humain</i> “of or belonging to man.” That word, in turn, comes from the Latin <i>humanus</i>, thought to be a hybrid relative of <i>homo</i>, meaning “man,” and <i>humus</i>, meaning “earth.” Thus, a <i>human</i>, unlike birds, planes, or even divine spirits up above, is a man firmly rooted to the earth.</p></div>`;
