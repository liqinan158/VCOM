If you are <i>regretful</i> about how you treated your brother when you were little, you now wish you had been nicer.</p><p class="long">Regret is a feeling of sorrow — wishing you could do something differently or undo an action. So, when you are regretful, you might feel frustrated, disappointed with yourself, embarrassed, or even sad. In fact, <i>regretful</i> comes from the Proto-Germanic word for weep, <i>gretan</i>. It can be hard to do, but the point is to learn from regretful experiences so you don't repeat them.</p></div></div>`;
