The word is a literal translation of the Latin <i>locus communis</i> for "general topic." Commonplace things and behavior are ordinary. For example, a commonplace job is a boring, mind-numbing task. It’s humdrum and unglamorous. A commonplace word or saying is a cliché — it's so common that it becomes meaningless and annoying.</p></div></div>`;
