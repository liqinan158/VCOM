If you let this disapproval show, you're acting disapprovingly. When your mom disapprovingly asks your friends not to eat in the living room, she makes it clear she's not in favor of crumbs in the couch. And if you comment disapprovingly on an online news story, you're likely to get equally cranky responses from other readers.</p></div>`;
