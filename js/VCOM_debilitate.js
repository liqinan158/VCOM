A bad flu may <i>debilitate</i> your powers of concentration, like the New Year's resolutions that temporarily <i>debilitate</i> bakeries' business.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>debilitate</i> traces back to the Latin word <i>debilis</i>, meaning “lame, disabled, crippled.” It’s often used to describe what disability or illness does to a person's health, but it can describe anything that has been weakened, like the sense of community that is slowly debilitated by people working longer hours and the lack of sidewalks that in many towns make it harder to walk around and meet the neighbors.</p></div>`;
