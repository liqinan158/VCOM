It’s the opposite of intelligence. <i>Stupidity</i> is responsible for many acts that follow the words, “Hey, watch this!”</p><p class="long">Being stupid has to do with not understanding things, not learning from past experiences, and generally not using your brain, so <i>stupidity</i> refers to this quality. Saying that someone did something because of stupidity is an insult because it means the person really should’ve known better. Riding in a shopping cart tied to the back of a car and zinging around a parking lot would be the result of some serious stupidity.</p></div></div>`;
