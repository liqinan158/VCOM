If a girl invites you up to her <i>flat</i>, she's not trying to squash you, she's inviting you over. And she's probably from England, because <i>flat</i> is much more common in British than American English.</p><p class="long">Geometrically, something flat is an even, level plane, like Kansas relative to the Rocky Mountains, or the cargo area of a flatbed truck. As an adjective, <i>flat</i> means "less than lively." A flat soda has no bubbles. If your speech falls flat, no one was excited. If you get mugged you might choose to lie flat on the ground. A flat note is just below the right pitch. And if you're cooking is flat, it's boring.</p></div></div>`;
