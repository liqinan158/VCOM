It's a given that a first class airplane ticket will cost a lot more than a seat in coach, and it's also a given that the earth orbits the sun. It can also be an adjective: "After considering the <i>given</i> facts, mark an answer on the multiple-choice test." <i>Given</i> comes from the verb <i>give</i>, which has an Old English root of <i>giefan</i>, "to bestow, allot, or commit."</p></div>`;
