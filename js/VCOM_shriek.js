A common response to finding a snake curled in the silverware drawer would be to <i>shriek</i>.</p><p class="long">You can shriek in fear, surprise, or even shriek with laughter. If the sound you make is high, sharp, and loud, it's a shriek. A teenager who sees her favorite movie star might shriek, "Look who it is!" And, little kids in an inflatable bouncy house will very likely shriek with delight. The word <i>shriek</i> sounds very much like what it means, and its Old Norse root <i>skr√¶kja</i>, "to screech," may have originated for that very reason.</p></div></div>`;
