Waving the flag is an obvious way, but anything that celebrates your country or makes it stronger is a great display of patriotism. Whenever a country is at war, people are more vocal about their patriotism, playing <i>patriotic</i> songs and making speeches full of national pride. Showing patriotism is so important that politicians will argue with each other about who really has more patriotism.</p></div>`;
