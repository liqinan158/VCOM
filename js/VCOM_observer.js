Another kind of observer is one who notices things deliberately, like political observers who watch and comment on various events. Many newspapers once had the word <i>observer</i> in their names, from this second sense of the word. The verb <i>observe</i> has a Latin root, <i>observare</i>, which means "watch over, note, heed, or attend to."</p></div></div>`;
