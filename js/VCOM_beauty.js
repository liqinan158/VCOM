Anything that has it pleases the senses, like a delicious scent, a perfect piece of pie, or a gorgeous person walking by.</p><p class="long">A noun describing an incredibly pleasing or harmonious quality or feature, <i>beauty</i> is hard to describe. Sure, super models and classical paintings exhibit beauty. But so do well designed sports cars and perfectly executed soccer goals. Belle found beauty in the Beast, astrologers find beauty in the stars, and arachnologists find beauty in giant hairy spiders. So that's why many people say that "beauty is in the eye of the beholder."</p></div></div>`;
