On summer nights, you might hear cicadas <i>drone</i>, and on snowy winter mornings, hear your neighbor's snow blower <i>drone</i>.</p><p class="long">Like animals and machines, people drone too, their voices sounding dull and tedious: "When my history teacher <i>drones</i> on, it's hard to stay awake." <i>Drone</i> is also a noun, meaning the monotonous sound itself, like the drone of a boring lecture; or a male worker bee; or a person who's as unambitious as a worker bee.
