You can also use conciliation to bring two other people or groups to an understanding, the way a mediator does when people get divorced, or a peacekeeper works with hostile countries. The Latin root, <i>conciliationem</i>, means "a connection, union, or bond," or literally, "a making friendly."</p></div>`;
