A <i>brute</i> is a person who is as ferocious as a wild animal.</p><p class="long">A violent, savage person can be described as a brute, and so can a wild animal. Someone who's less monstrous but is still unpleasant can also be a brute, and it can be used as an adjective to mean, basically, "brutal." If it's more animal than human, you can call it brute, like the brute power of an invading army. The Latin <i>brutus</i>, "heavy, dull, or stupid," gave rise to <i>brute</i>, which through the 15th century only referred to animals.</p></div>`;
