It can be pretty unpleasant to watch your brother <i>chew</i> his pizza with his mouth open.</p><p class="long">Usually when people chew, they chew up a bite of food or chew on a candy bar. You can also chew your nails or chew your lower lip â€” you're not actually eating something, but just using your teeth to gnaw or bite. You can also use the word <i>chew</i> figuratively, to mean "think or mull over." It comes from an Old English root, <i>ceowan</i>, "to gnaw or chew."</p></div>`;
