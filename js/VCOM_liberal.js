Also, a <i>liberal</i> attitude toward anything means more tolerance for change.</p><p class="long">There are many meanings for <i>liberal</i>, but they mostly have to do with freedom and openness to change. A teacher with a liberal policy toward attendance is going to be forgiving of missed days. A bank with a liberal attitude toward your money would probably be bad: some things are awful if they're loose and free. But no one will give you a hard time if you use a liberal amount of catsup on your fries.</p></div></div>`;
