Mammals, including humans, are part of the phylum chordata, which also includes fishes, amphibians, reptiles, and birds. As you can see thatâ€™s a very broad category. Phylum comes above class and below kingdom in the biological classification system. The ranks get increasingly narrow, working all the way down to species, which is a closely related group.</p></div></div>`;
