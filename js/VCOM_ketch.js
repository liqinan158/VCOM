A <i>ketch</i> is a good sailboat to cruise around on if you’re experienced enough to handle a big boat (or if you know someone who is).</p><p class="long">It's more common to sail a ketch in Europe than in the United States, where sailors tend to prefer the schooner. The two boats are similar in size and have two masts, but a ketch has a smaller sail in back. Fans of the ketch describe it as extremely balanced, while critics say a ketch loses power too easily because of that small rear sail. The word was originally spelled "catch," from the Middle English <i>cacchen</i>, for “to capture, chase.”</p></div></div>`;
