You can easily tell if a pheasant is a male â€” its coloring will be bright and showy, and it may have a wattle and an extremely long tail. Females tend to be smaller, with brown and white striped feathers. The midwestern states are popular with pheasant hunters, since the birds are plentiful there.</p></div>`;
