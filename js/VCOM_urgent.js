If you break your leg, you'll need <i>urgent</i> attention at the hospital â€” that means the  doctors will tend to you without delay.</p><p class="long"><i>Urgent</i> comes from the Latin word <i>urgentem</i>, meaning "to press hard, urge."  You can see that <i>urgent</i> contains the word <i>urge</i>, meaning "to demand or insist." When you get an urgent message, you need to drop what you're doing to deal with it. An urgent need, like hunger, is a pressing one. If you're a music fan, you might know the song "Urgent" by the band Foreigner. The song's lyrics "make it fast, make it urgent" and its frenetic style help define the word.</p></div>`;
