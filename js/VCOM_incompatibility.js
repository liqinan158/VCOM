She's married to him, he's married to his work? That's <i>incompatibility</i> right there: the inability of two sides to exist in a harmonious relationship with each other because of their different outlooks and beliefs.</p><p class="long">It's not just relationships between people that are characterized by <i>incompatibility,</i> though that's the most common use of the term. Different objects and ideas can be, too. Being tone deaf is incompatible with being a good singer, for example, and if anyone's ever tried to run a Mac program on a PC they know all about the incompatibility of different computer systems.</p></div></div>`;
