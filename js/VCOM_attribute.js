Your best <i>attribute</i> might be your willingness to help others, like when you stopped traffic so the duck family could cross the street.</p><p class="long"><i>Attribute</i> comes from the Latin verb <i>attribuere</i>, which is made up the prefix <i>ad</i>, meaning "to," and <i>tribuere</i> meaning "give or bestow." As a verb, to <i>attribute</i> is to give credit, like if you attribute the A on your test to all that hard studying. In Greek and Roman mythology an attribute will often stand in for a character such as Zeus's lightning bolt or Poseidon's trident.</p></div>`;
