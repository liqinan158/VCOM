Something opalescent has that same reflective quality. High-quality guitars, for example, often have opalescent inlays in the fingerboard that are not only beautiful but also useful. They can help the guitar player find her way around the instrument. Don't be fooled by imitations! Many fake jewels have an <i>opalescent</i> quality that mimics real pearl, but it's plastic, all the same.</p></div>`;
