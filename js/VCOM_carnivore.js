They eat penguins!”</p><p class="long">It’s a useful thing to be acquainted with the root <i>vore</i>, which means eat, because you can get <i>herbivore</i> (eats plants), <i>omnivore</i> (eats everything), and <i>sanguivore</i> (eats blood, yes, like vampires). It’s nice to know, too, that it’s not only animals that are <i>carnivores</i>. Some plants, like the Venus flytrap, eat insects, which makes them <i>carnivores</i> as well. It’s nice, too, to have the prefix of <i>carnivore</i>, <i>carn</i> or flesh, in your mind. The easiest way to remember it? <i>Chili con carne</i>, or chili with meat.</p></div></div>`;
