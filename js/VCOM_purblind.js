This word is also used figuratively to describe someone who lacks insight or good judgment, like your <i>purblind</i> uncle who always gives foolish advice.</p><p class="long">These days, it's quite old-fashioned to describe someone as purblind, although you may come across the word in old books. When it first appeared around 1300, it was two words, <i>pur blind</i> (possibly from <i>pure</i>) and it meant "entirely blind." Later, it was used to mean "a blind person," and then "partially blind" â€” like your elderly, purblind poodle, who has become almost entirely dependent on her sense of smell.</p></div></div>`;
