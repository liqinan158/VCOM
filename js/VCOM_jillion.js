If your next door neighbor has too many cats to count, go ahead and say they've got a <i>jillion</i> cats.</p><p class="long">Similar to words like <i>zillion</i>, <i>tons</i>, or <i>oodles</i>, <i>jillion</i> is perfect for talking about a huge but vague number. It's also hyperbolic â€” in other words, it's an exaggeration. The word is modeled on actual numbers like <i>million</i> and <i>billion</i>, so it almost sounds like a real quantity. But like <i>zillion</i>, <i>jillion</i> is imprecise. Its origin is vague too, described as an "arbitrary coinage" first used around 1940.</p></div></div>`;
