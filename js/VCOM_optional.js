Things like a DVD player mounted in the ceiling are optional, you don't need them for the car to work, and it's up to you if you want to pay more for them. The opposite of <i>optional</i> is <i>mandatory</i>. If you're in high school, going to bed at 8:00 is optional, for your little sister in elementary school, it's mandatory.</p></div></div>`;
