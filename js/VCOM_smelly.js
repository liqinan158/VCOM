After her joyful swim in a swampy lake, your dog will probably be <i>smelly</i>.</p><p class="long">You could call smelly things stinky, putrid, or rank. Your brother's sweaty feet are smelly, and your neighbor's cabbage soup is smelly too. While things like flowers and homemade gingerbread are fragrant or aromatic, smelly things — like your neighborhood on garbage day — are just plain smelly. We know that <i>smelly</i> comes from <i>smell</i>, "odor, aroma, or stench," which followed the verb <i>smell</i>, "emit or perceive an odor," but the word's origin is unknown.</p></div>`;
