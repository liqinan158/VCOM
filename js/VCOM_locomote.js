If your siblings' popcorn munching is annoying you during family movie night, you might want to <i>locomote</i> to a chair on the other side of the room.</p><p class="long"><i>Locomote</i> isn't used much anymore â€” you're probably more familiar with related words like <i>locomotive</i> and <i>locomotion</i>. All of these words share the Latin roots <i>loco</i>, "from a place," and <i> motio</i>, "motion." So whenever you're moving from spot to a different one, you can use this unusual verb: "It's time to locomote to Spanish class, see you later!"</p></div>`;
