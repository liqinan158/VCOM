The word <i>schizophrenia</i> combines the Greek <i>skhizein</i>, "split," and <i>phren</i>, "mind." Now, the disease is understood differently, but <i>schizophrenic</i> is still sometimes used to refer to anything that changes erratically. A movie that's alternately enthralling and boring might be said to be schizophrenic in its pacing.</p></div>`;
