If you go camping, you might take a <i>hatchet</i> with you.</p><p class="long">If someone hands you a hatchet and tells you to start splitting a pile of firewood, they expect you to chop each log into smaller pieces. The difference between a hatchet and an ax is that hatchets have short handles and are meant to be held in one hand. Axes have longer handles for two-handed chopping. If someone wants to "bury the <i>hatchet</i>," it's not a threatâ€”they just want to end an argument and be friends.</p></div>`;
