When you color in the bubbles on a standardized test, a #2 <i>pencil</i> is the way to go.</p><p class="long">Unlike pens, which use ink, pencils have a pointed cylinder of graphite that makes marks on paper. Most pencils are wood with a thin center of graphite, although mechanical pencils are made of metal or plastic and look more like pens. You might describe an artwork as a pencil drawing, or ask if you can pencil some notes in the margins of your friend's copy of "Moby Dick." When you "<i>pencil</i> something in," you mark it tentatively on your calendar, knowing you might have to erase it later if your plans change.</p></div>`;
