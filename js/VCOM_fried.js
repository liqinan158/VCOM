You can order <i>fried</i> rice at a Chinese restaurant, or <i>fried</i> clams at your favorite seafood place.</p><p class="long">Some foods are lightly stir fried, while others are submerged in boiling oil and deep fried. At a state fair, there are offerings including fried dough and fried chicken, and it's even possible to eat fried candy bars or fried ice cream. Colloquially, someone who's exhausted might say, "I'm totally <i>fried</i>." <i>Fried</i> comes from the verb <i>fry</i>, which has the Latin root <i>frigere</i>, both "to fry" and "to roast."</p></div></div>`;
