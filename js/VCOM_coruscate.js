Think of the way the little mirrors on a disco ball <i>coruscate</i> as the ball twirls, making the dance floor sparkle.</p><p class="long">Although <i>coruscate</i> means to glitter with light, you can also use the word, in a less literal way, to refer to someone with such great style or ability that they seem to sparkle. Your best friend's performance in the school play might coruscate with such brilliance that the audience gives her a standing ovation during her curtain call.</p></div></div>`;
