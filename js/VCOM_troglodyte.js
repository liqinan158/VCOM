You could call this type a "hermit" or a "recluse," but it's more fun to say <i>troglodyte</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Troglodyte</i> is formed from the Greek words <i>trogle</i>, "hole", and <i>dyein</i>, "to dive into." The word translates to mean "he who dwells in caves." While a troglodyte can be what we think of as a pre-historic caveman, it also means someone who lives in any sort of tiny, unkempt house. Nowadays, a troglodyte generally refers to someone who lives alone, like a hermit. If you donâ€™t mind having a dirty hole for a home, then perhaps you are a troglodyte.</p></div>`;
