As the meaning developed, the word came to mean "rude, vulgar, or lacking refinement." Interestingly, the word <i>uncouth</i> came first and its antonym, <i>couth</i>, was developed to describe someone who is cultured, polished, and sophisticated. Although <i>couth</i> gets an entry in the dictionary, you will still hear the word <i>uncouth</i> used far more often.</p></div></div>`;
