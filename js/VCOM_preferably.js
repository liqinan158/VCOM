You could say you were looking for a new car, <i>preferably</i> a hybrid. That means that a hybrid is the kind of car you would choose over any other kind.</p><p class="long">As <i>preferably</i> is the adverb form of the word "prefer," we can find its roots in the Latin <i>praeferre</i>, which means "to set before."  When you use <i>preferably</i> you're saying you'd set that choice before all others, though you might accept something else.  Musician David Byrne once said, "I wanted to be a secret agent and an astronaut, preferably at the same time."</p></div></div>`;
