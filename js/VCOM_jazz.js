If you've ever listened to Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, or Thelonious Monk, <i>jazz</i> is what you're hearing.</p><p class="long">The term <i>jazz</i> originated not with music, but in baseball, where it was used as a synonym for "pep, vim, vigor." It began to be used to describe music about a decade after jazz first began to be played in 1900 New Orleans. Since then, like the art form it describes, <i>jazz</i> has changed and expanded its meaning. Today, <i>jazz</i> can refer to a genre of dance, to the act of "sprucing something up," to the decade of the 1920s (nicknamed The Jazz Age), or to holding your hands above your head and waving your fingers, making <i>jazz hands</i>.</p></div></div>`;
