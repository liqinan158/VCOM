When an object is truncated, its end or point is cut off, like a truncated arrow that is safe for kids to play with. <i>Truncated</i> can also refer to something that ends earlier than planned â€” everyone was angry at the truncated concert until they learned that the singer had broken his leg when he fell on stage.</p></div></div>`;
