If someone is weaving all over the place when they walk, that could be an indication that they’re drunk. But then again, it could indicate an inner-ear infection that has ruined their balance. The verb, <i>indicate</i>, literally means to point out, by using your <i>index</i> finger. But indications don’t require actual fingers pointing to a cause.</p></div>`;
