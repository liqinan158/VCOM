You also belong to a group of friends — you fit in, or are a member. When you feel at home somewhere, as though you're meant to be there, you also belong: "I <i>belong</i> in a big city!" The 14th century meaning of <i>belong</i> was "to go along with," from <i>be-</i> and <i>longen</i>, "to go."</p></div>`;
