You might be in a serious <i>funk</i> after your best friend moves across the country.</p><p class="long">One way to use <i>funk</i> is to mean "blues" or "depression." Everyone's in a funk sometimes — for some people, the shorter, darker winter days automatically put them in a bit of a funk. <i>Funk</i> also refers to a bluesy kind of music with a strong underlying bass rhythm. It comes from <i>funky</i>, which means "stinky" or "musty smelling," from the French <i>funkière</i>, "smoke." In African American music, <i>funky</i> became a compliment, a description of soulful, earthy music — like <i>funk</i> itself.</p></div></div>`;
