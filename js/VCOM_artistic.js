While you might not consider the sculptor Oldenburg's inflatable toilet as "art," recreating something ordinary in a unique way is very <i>artistic.</i></p><p class="long"><i>Artistic</i> often describes something pleasing to look at, but you don't have to like everything called <i>artistic.</i> If you make paintings, clay figures, or computer drawings, you're being artistic, because you're creating works of art. If you're creative in a less structured way — say, you arrange everything on your desk by shape and color so it looks nice and you enjoy doing it — that's artistic too. It may not always be "art," but it's still artistic creation.</p></div>`;
