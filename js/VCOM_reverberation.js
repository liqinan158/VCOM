When you bang on a big piece of metal, you can hear the <i>reverberation</i> even after you stop banging.</p><p class="long">The repeating, often low, booming sound that follows the strum of an electric guitar or the thump of a drumstick on a cymbal is called <i>reverberation</i>. It's frequently described as sound that lingers beyond the original noise. You can also use the word to describe something else that lingers, like a feeling or an effect: "The <i>reverberations</i> of the war lasted for decades." Originally, <i>reverberation</i> was "reflection of light or heat," from the Old French <i>reverberacion</i>, "great flash of light."</p></div></div>`;
