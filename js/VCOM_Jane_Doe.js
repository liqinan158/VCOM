In the case of a man, you'd call him <i>John Doe</i>. The need for a placeholder name comes up from time to time in legal cases â€” and sometimes people use the term <i>Jane Doe</i> to mean "an average, ordinary woman," or an unidentified patient or crime victim. <i>John Doe</i> has been used since the mid-1700's, with <i>Jane Doe</i> following soon after.</p></div></div>`;
