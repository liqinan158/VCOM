Think of an escrow as a deed rolled up and delivered to a trusted person who hangs onto it, only giving out the money on the deed after the person who's supposed to get it does whatever he agreed to do. It's a safe way to do business, and prevents sellers from running off with your money before they've given you what you bought.</p></div></div>`;
