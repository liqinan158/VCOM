A bookseller might <i>reclassify</i> a memoir as "fiction" after it's revealed that the author invented most of the people and events in it.</p><p class="long">Your boss where you work part-time may reclassify you as a full-time worker in the summer, when you have more time for your job. And your school might consider cheerleading to be a club, while some others have decided to reclassify it as a sport. In both cases, something has changed categories. The verb <i>reclassify</i> adds the "again" prefix <i>re-</i> to <i>classify</i>, which means "put into a class or group."</p></div></div>`;
