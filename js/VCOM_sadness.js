Sadness may be the overwhelming mood at a funeral, for example, or an elderly man might describe his life's greatest sadness as letting his childhood sweetheart get away. An interesting thing about <i>sadness</i> is that its original meaning was "seriousness." It wasn't until the 1600s that it came to mean "full of sorrow."</p></div></div>`;
