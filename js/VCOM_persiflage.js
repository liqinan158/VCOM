After a softball batter strikes out, she can expect to hear some <i>persiflage</i> from her teammates in the dugout.</p><p class="long">You and a friend might have a joking relationship full of persiflage, or a joking way of gently mocking each other. You can also call any kind of lighthearted talk <i>persiflage</i> â€” like dinner party small talk. The term was particularly popular in 19th century literature, and its origin traces back to the Latin word for "hiss," <i>sibilare</i>. From that came the French word <i>siffler</i>, "to whistle or hiss," <i>persifler</i>, "banter," and finally <i>persiflage</i>.</p></div></div>`;
