A <i>writ</i> is a written document issuing a legal order.</p><p class="long">The word <i>writ</i> has been around since before the twelfth century and was first used to describe a written document needed to have a case heard at the royal courts of England during the Middle Ages. Nowadays, the king is most likely no longer involved, but this word still refers to a legal document issued by a court of law. A writ contains a written order instructing someone to do something or to stop doing something. If you ever need to give out a writ, remember that the verb <i>to serve</i> is typically used to describe the issuing of a writ — as in “Tony was served with a <i>writ</i> on Monday.”</p></div>`;
