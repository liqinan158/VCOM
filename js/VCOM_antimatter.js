Words beginning with <i>anti</i> are opposed to their root. Therefore, antimatter is the opposite of matter. If antimatter and matter were to collide, both would be destroyed, releasing a huge and dangerous amount of energy. This happens because the particles that make up matter and the antiparticles that make up antimatter have opposite electric charges. The existence of antimatter is something studied by physicists.</p></div>`;
