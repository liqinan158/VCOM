And that's what a <i>preamble</i> does â€” it "walks" before a speech, often explaining what's coming. It's like the White Rabbit introducing the Queen of Hearts in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>.  Since it goes before a speech, think of it as a <i>pre-ramble</i>.  A <i>preamble</i> is usually used for formal documents; you wouldn't include one in a text to your best friend.</p></div>`;
