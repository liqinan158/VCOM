People have been using <i>sesame</i> for its oil and seeds for over 3,000 years. That’s a lot of <i>sesame</i> bagels.</p><p class="long">Tiny sesame seeds are often used in baked goods, on sushi, to make oil, and in the Middle Eastern paste, tahini. The word itself is rooted in the Greek <i>sesamon</i>, "seed or fruit of the sesame plant." It's also been part of the well-known magical phrase, "open <i>sesame</i>" since Antoine Galland added it to the “One Thousand and One Nights.” in French: "Sésame, ouvre-toi!" Ali Baba uses it to open the forty thieves’ cave.</p></div></div>`;
