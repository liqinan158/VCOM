Accused criminals must offer <i>confutation</i> if they hope to be found innocent.</p><p class="long">If you know the verb <i>confute</i> — which means to overwhelm through an argument — this noun will be a no-brainer: it refers to the act of confuting, or a statement that confutes. The meaning is not that far removed from <i>refutation</i>, with which <i>confutation</i> shares a Latin root. A confutation proves that another idea is false or nonsensical. People who argue for a living, like lawyers, are masters of confutation.</p></div></div>`;
