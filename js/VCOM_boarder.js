It can also be a student who lives and studies away from home at a boarding school.</p><p class="long">There are two main meanings of <i>boarder</i>, but they both involve staying somewhere away from home. A boarding school is a private school where students live as well as study. Those students are called boarders. Also, if someone rents a room of their house to guests, the guests are boarders.
