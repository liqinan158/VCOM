A <i>round table</i> is just a meeting for people to listen to each other’s point of view.</p><p class="long">Organizations hold round tables (also <i>roundtables</i>) so people have a chance to talk about something in an equal way, with each person getting a chance to speak. This idea is modeled after King Arthur's mythical Round Table, which is mentioned in the Arthurian legend as a place where all the knights could sit in symbolic equality, with no one at the "head" of the table. The Algonquin Round Table came later and was where writers like Dorothy Parker went to gab.</p></div></div>`;
