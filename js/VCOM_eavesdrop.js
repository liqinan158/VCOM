A little girl might <i>eavesdrop</i> on her parents in an attempt to find out what she's getting for her birthday.</p><p class="long">Whenever you deliberately overhear a phone conversation, or two people having a quiet argument, you eavesdrop. You might eavesdrop on a funny exchange between two friends at a cafe, or eavesdrop on an important conversation between your boss and one of your coworkers. The verb <i>eavesdrop</i> comes from the old-fashioned noun <i>eavesdropper</i>, "one who listens from under the eaves," from the even more old-fashioned <i>eavesdrop</i>, "ground where rainwater drips off the roof."</p></div>`;
