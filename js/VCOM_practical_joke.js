Popular on April Fools’ Day, a <i>practical joke</i> is a physical trick, like sneaking a “kick me” sign on someone’s back or giving them a hunk of dirt and calling it chocolate.</p><p class="long">Practical jokes usually involve some physical action, and unlike scams or hoaxes, they're intended to be revealed as pranks — even the victim is supposed to eventually realize that a practical joke's been played on them. Ideally, practical jokes are lighthearted and silly, rather than cruel or humiliating. April Fools’ Day, the first of April, is traditionally a day of many practical jokes, from plastic wrap on the toilet seat to quarters superglued to the sidewalk.</p></div>`;
