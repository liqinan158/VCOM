If the school cafeteria offers only <i>unappetizing</i> mystery meat and limp salad, you'll probably decide to bring a sandwich for lunch.</p><p class="long">Your personal list of unappetizing things might include black licorice, brussels sprouts, and egg salad. You can also use this adjective for other things that leave you feeling a little queasy, like a relative's unappetizing political convictions or an unappetizing scene in a horror movie that makes you cover your eyes. <i>Unappetizing</i> is what you get when you add the "not" prefix <i>un-</i> to <i>appetizing</i>, which stems from the Latin <i>appetitus</i>, "desiring toward."</p></div></div>`;
