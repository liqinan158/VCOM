Just after they <i>fledge</i>, birds take their first practice flights.</p><p class="long">You can use the verb <i>fledge</i> in several ways — first, to describe what happens when a bird's feathers grow in. A mother bird — or human — who cares for and raises a young bird can also be said to fledge it. You can also talk about the process of putting feathers on something, especially a hunting arrow, this way: "Once you <i>fledge</i> the arrow, you can use it with your bow." The Old English root word is <i>flycge</i>, "having feathers, or fit to fly."</p></div>`;
