If you thought the bad words you muttered under your breath were <i>inaudible</i>, perhaps you should've turned off that microphone in front of you!</p><p class="long">In Latin, <i>audire</i> means “to hear,” so it makes sense, then, that <i>inaudible</i> means “imperceptible by the ear,” since <i>in</i>- means “not.” You should strive to speak in a near-<i>inaudible</i> whisper if you need to talk to your seatmate at the opera, but in normal, everyday conversation, you won’t get your point across unless you talk at a louder volume. Synonyms for <i>inaudible</i> range from <i>faint</i> and <i>muffled</i> to <i>uncommunicative</i> and <i>voiceless</i>.</p></div>`;
