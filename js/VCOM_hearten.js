Things that encourage or inspire, whether it's the sight of your dog waiting for you outside school or another person's success, can also be said to hearten. The figurative meaning of <i>heart</i> — as in "losing heart" or having a "change of heart" — is at the root of <i>hearten</i>, from the Old English <i>heorte</i>, "heart, soul, or spirit."</p></div>`;
