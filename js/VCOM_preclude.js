See the prefix <i>pre</i> in <i>preclude</i> and in <i>prevent</i>? It is signaling that these words are all about things done before another action would happen â€” to make it impossible. Staying away from water precludes the possibility of drowning, though it also precludes any chance of having fun swimming.</p></div></div>`;
