If you <i>dote</i> on someone, you shower them with love and attention. Sounds like the life!</p><p class="long">Parents that dote on their children too much might find themselves in trouble down the road; all that unadulterated devotion is a surefire way to spoil your kid. The problem is that those who are doing the doting are often too smitten to see when the object of their affection is acting like a complete jerk. No wonder <i>dote</i> is related to a German word that means "to be foolish." That connection might also explain the use of <i>dote</i> to mean acting senile in one's later years.</p></div>`;
