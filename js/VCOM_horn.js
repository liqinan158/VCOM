Another type of <i>horn</i> comes out of an animal's head. Don't confuse the two and imagine a trombone sticking out of a water buffalo's head.</p><p class="long">A trumpet is one kind of horn, and another is a silly plastic noisemaker that produces a loud, honking sound. You might blow this horn at a New Year's party or a football game. Your car has a horn too, that you use to warn other drivers of your presence or express your annoyance. The horns that animals have are hard, bony bumps or projections on their heads â€” you'll see them on goats and bulls, for example.</p></div>`;
