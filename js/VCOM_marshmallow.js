Marshmallows can be toasted over a fire to turn them slightly crisp on the outside and melty within, and sandwiched between graham crackers with chocolate to make a "s'more." The original 19th century marshmallows were made from a plant called <i>mersc-mealwe</i> (marsh mallow plant) in Old English.</p></div></div>`;
