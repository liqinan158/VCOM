Indigenous people of North America lived (and many continue to live) in tribes, although the word itself is controversial â€” many of their members prefer the terms <i>nation</i> or <i>ethnic group</i> instead. Sometimes <i>tribe</i> is used to simply mean "family" or "clan," or even a large group: "A <i>tribe</i> of college students roamed the streets."</p></div></div>`;
