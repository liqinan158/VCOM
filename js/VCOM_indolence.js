In the 1600s, <i>indolence</i> was mostly used to mean "insensitivity to pain," from the Latin <i>indolentia</i>, "freedom from pain." About 100 years later, <i>indolence</i> came to have its current meaning, possibly because of the phrase "taking pains," which means "being careful." If you are so careful that you never leave the house, people might think of you as lazy.</p></div>`;
