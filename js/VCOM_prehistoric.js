The prefix <i>pre-</i>, means “before” and <i>historic</i> relates to something from a past culture. Put the two together, and you get <i>prehistoric</i>, a word that describes something that comes from a time before history was recorded. For example, Stonehenge is a <i>prehistoric</i> site, or the woolly mammoth is a <i>prehistoric</i> beast.</p></div>`;
