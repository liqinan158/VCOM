Along those lines, we say someone is in the flesh when they are physically present somewhere. If you went to the Grand Canyon, you were there in the flesh. If you go to a restaurant with someone, you saw them in the flesh. Talking on the phone or emailing are not examples of communicating in the flesh, which requires being present.</p></div>`;
