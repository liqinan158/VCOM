You don't have to comply with your friend's <i>command</i> that you give him all your money.</p><p class="long"><i>Command</i>, which can be a noun or a verb, combines the Latin prefix <i>com</i>-, meaning "with," and <i>mandƒÅre</i>, "to charge, enjoin," so to give someone a command is to say something with the authority that charges him to follow it. Your mother might command you to clean your room. <i>Command</i> can also mean a position of power, like having command of a battleship, or possession of a skill, like having a great command of video games.</p></div></div>`;
