You may have heard that opposites attract, but initial attraction doesn’t necessarily mean that opposites will be compatible in the long-term. Advised Russian novelist and philosopher Leo Tolstoy, “What counts in making a happy marriage is not so much how compatible you are, but how you deal with incompatibility.”</p></div></div>`;
