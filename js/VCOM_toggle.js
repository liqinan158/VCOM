As a verb, it means "switch or alternate," the way you <i>toggle</i> between screens as you video chat with two friends at once.</p><p class="long">The 18th century definition of <i>toggle</i> was "pin passed through the eye of a rope to hold it in place." It's still used for a similar kind of fastener, as well as for an up-and-down switch such as a light switch. In computer technology, a toggle is an on-off command, like the key that turns your caps lock on or off. You can also use this word figuratively: you might find it difficult to toggle between French homework and Spanish homework without mixing up your verbs.</p></div></div>`;
