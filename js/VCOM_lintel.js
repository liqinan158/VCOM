Most <i>lintels</i> are decorative as well as providing structural support.</p><p class="long">A lintel can be purely ornamental, just an attractive horizontal flourish at the top of a door, or it can be a wood or metal support piece that also looks nice. Your fireplace might be topped by a stone lintel, and you might see a much older lintel in ancient Roman ruins, at the top of two massive pillars. In Old French, <i>lintel</i> means "threshold," from the Latin word <i>limitaris</i>, "bordering."</p></div></div>`;
