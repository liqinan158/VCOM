You might <i>resent</i> having to work late, but if your boss pays you a higher wage for overtime, maybe youâ€™ll be less <i>resentful</i>. When there are clear inequalities among people, it often makes them resentful. Someone who wears themselves out doing heavy labor might be resentful of their boss who never breaks a sweat but earns more money.</p></div>`;
