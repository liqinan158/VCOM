It's safe to say that no one wants to be caught on the receiving end of an <i>onslaught</i>, because there will be lots of danger, destruction and probably death.</p><p class="long">One way to help you remember the brutal meaning of <i>onslaught</i> is through the word's English origin, <i>slaught,</i> meaning "slaughter." But <i>onslaught</i> can be used in non-military ways, too. It can mean a barrage of written or spoken communication, like an onslaught of emailed birthday wishes. Taken individually, the birthday wishes are nice but an onslaught is too many, too fast, all at once. Onslaught can also mean a sudden and severe start of trouble. For example, if your office is unprepared for the onslaught of flu season, the entire sales force will be home sick at the same time.</p></div></div>`;
