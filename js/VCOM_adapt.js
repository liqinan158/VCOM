At first the food scalds your tongue, but over time you <i>adapt</i> — you change in a way that allows you to deal with the new circumstances.</p><p class="long"><i>Adapt</i> comes from the ancient word <i>ap</i>, which means "take" or "grasp." <i>Ap</i> is even older than Latin — it comes from a lost language that was spoken by the common ancestors of modern-day Indians and Europeans and has since been reconstructed by linguists, who named it the Proto-Indo-European language, or PIE.  So what does <i>adapt</i> have to do with <i>grasp</i>?  If you adapt to, say, a new country, it's as though you're grabbing hold of its strange, slippery customs.</p></div></div>`;
