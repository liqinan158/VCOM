Your kitten may get enmeshed in the snarl of yarn she's playing with â€” or your sister may become enmeshed in the fight between her two best friends. However you use this word, you'll find it equally appropriate for literal or figurative entanglements: "Don't enmesh me in your money making schemes!"</p></div>`;
