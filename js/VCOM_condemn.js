You may see politicians condemn each other in political ads during a campaign in hopes of improving their chances of winning an election. You also might hear of a convict being "<i>condemned</i> to death." In this sense of the word, to <i>condemn</i> still carries on its Latin meaning of "to sentence."</p></div></div>`;
