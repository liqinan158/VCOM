The root of <i>cyclical</i> is “cycle” which means movement in a circular fashion, or the circular fashion itself. Planets orbit the sun in cyclical patterns, the moon’s phases are cyclical as well. Some stock brokers say that the market is <i>cyclical</i>, but that may be just a way of telling people to keep investing when it's down.</p></div></div>`;
