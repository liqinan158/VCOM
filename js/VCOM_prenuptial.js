A common <i>prenuptial</i> superstition is that a couple shouldn't see each other on the day of their wedding until they're actually walking down the aisle.</p><p class="long">You're most likely to find this adjective in the legal term "<i>prenuptial</i> agreement," or <i>prenup</i> for short. This friendly-sounding phrase describes a legal contract signed by two people before their marriage, in which they agree to certain terms if they eventually get divorced. A prenuptial agreement might include details of dividing money or property, for example. <i>Pre-</i> means "before," and <i>nuptial</i> comes from the Latin <i>nuptiae</i>, "wedding."</p></div></div>`;
