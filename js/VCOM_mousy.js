If you're tired of your <i>mousy</i> hair, you can always dye it purple.</p><p class="long">If you think of mice as shy and boring, you'll understand the sense of the adjective <i>mousy</i>. Whether it's describing a color, like your mousy brown sweater, or a personality, like a timid, mousy classmate, <i>mousy</i> is rarely a compliment. The "quiet and unassertive" meaning is the oldest, dating from about 1812, while the reference to color came along forty years later.</p></div></div>`;
