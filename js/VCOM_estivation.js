During a period of <i>estivation</i>, many reptiles go underground where it's cooler.</p><p class="long">Estivation is very similar to hibernation, when some mammals spend the winter moving very little and sleeping a lot, in order to save energy. During estivation, animals become still and their breathing slows â€” but it occurs during the hottest months of the year. Reptiles, amphibians, and molluscs are most likely to go through estivation. The Latin root word is <i>aestus</i>,  or "heat."</p></div>`;
