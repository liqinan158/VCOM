If you find yourself stranded in the middle of the <i>desert</i>, you'll have no company except for the occasional lizard or scorpion.</p><p class="long"><i>Desert</i> comes from the Latin <i>desertus</i>, for abandoned or lying in waste. This can refer to a vast sandy area without vegetation, or any empty, lifeless expanse. As a verb, it means to leave someone or something. A soldier who runs away from the army is called a deserter. Occasionally you'll hear someone say, "He got his just deserts," which doesn't have anything to do with abandonment; it means he got what he deserved.</p></div>`;
