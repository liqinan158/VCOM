Car engineers consider <i>aerodynamics</i> when they design the shape of a vehicle.</p><p class="long"><i>Aerodynamics</i> is both the science of the way air moves, and also simply the way an object's shape affects how it moves through the air. Much of the design of airplanes focuses on the aerodynamics of their wings and noses, keeping them aloft and moving quickly through the air. The word <i>aerodynamics</i> has been around since the mid-1800s, combining the Greek prefix <i>aero-</i>, "air," and <i>dynamics</i>, a word applied to many branches of physics, from the Greek <i>dynamikos</i>, "powerful."</p></div>`;
