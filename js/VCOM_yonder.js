When your sister asks where you parked the car, you might jokingly reply, "<i>Yonder</i>, by the fire hydrant."</p><p class="long">Some dialects in various parts of the United States still use the word <i>yonder</i>, usually to specify something that's within sight, and often with accompanied by a gesture pointing toward it. You could say, "My dog's <i>yonder</i> in the corn field," or "I saw Billy <i>yonder</i>, on the tire swing." The phrase "wild blue <i>yonder</i>" was first used to refer to the sky in the 1939 U.S. Air Force song.</p></div></div>`;
