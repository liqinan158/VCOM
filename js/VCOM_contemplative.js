Contemplative moments, of course, aren't restricted to white-bearded hermits living in caves on mountaintops. You might also hear the word when people are talking about yoga or meditation, as these are quiet activities meant to be thoughtfully performed. Some kinds of poetry and music are described as contemplative, especially if they give you space to daydream or think about their themes. A walk through nature can also be a contemplative activity.</p></div></div>`;
