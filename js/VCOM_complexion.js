If you have light skin, for example, you might be said to have a fair or pale <i>complexion</i>.</p><p class="long">The general character of something can also be called its <i>complexion</i>. If your team's star quarterback is out with an injury, it will change the complexion of the next game and possibly the entire season. <i>Complexion</i> originally referred to the humors that in ancient Greek and Roman medicine supposedly made up a person's temperament and health. The word came from the Latin <i>complexionem</i>, or "combination," but as humorism fell out of favor, this definition of <i>complexion</i> also became obsolete.</p></div></div>`;
