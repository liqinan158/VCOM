You might run to the store for a <i>pack</i> of batteries for your new clock and a <i>pack</i> of crayons for your new coloring book.</p><p class="long">As a noun, <i>pack</i> might seem like a shortened form of <i>package</i>, but it actually comes from a Germanic root that means "bundle." You can also use this word to mean "group of animals" or "group of criminals," while the verb <i>pack</i> means "fill a bag for a trip." You might pack a pack of cards when you travel across the country by train, since you'll have a lot of hours to fill.</p></div>`;
