Your theater club might have to <i>pull out all the stops</i> to get your play ready for opening night.</p><p class="long">Every player on a basketball team has to pull out all the stops to win a challenging playoff game, and a preschool teacher might have to pull out all the stops almost daily to keep his class interested and happy. This phrase comes from the pipe organ: when a player pulls the organ's stops out, more air flows through the pipes and the volume increases. Pulling out all the stops would result in extremely loud, energetic music.</p></div></div>`;
