Say you ask your friend to meet you at a specific time and place â€” it means you want to meet her at, say, Ray's Pizza at 3:00 PM, not just anywhere.</p><p class="long"><i>Specific</i> also means "detailed and exact."  That's the sense of the word that comes into play when a teacher advises you to be as specific as possible.  Indeed, specific writing paints a picture.  Say your friend Angela lives on a soybean farm in Iowa and takes Claritin for her pollen allergy.  That might not be the most interesting fact in the world, but it's a lot more interesting than saying you have a friend who lives in the Midwest and takes medicine for a problem.  If the sentence about Angela's pollen allergy is interesting at all, it's because of the specifics.</p></div>`;
