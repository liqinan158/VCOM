Sometimes entire countries are described as <i>combatants</i> during military conflicts.</p><p class="long">Other names for a <i>combatant</i> are "fighter," "attacker," or "soldier." News stories are more likely to use this word to describe an adversary or enemy: "Enemy <i>combatants</i> ignored the cease fire." When they're talking about their own country's fighters, they might say "troops" or "soldiers." <i>Combatant</i> comes from the Old French <i>combatant</i>, "skilled at fighting" or "warlike."</p></div>`;
