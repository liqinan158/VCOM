var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">succinctly</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To say something <i>succinctly</i> is to say it briefly, fitting your points into one concise statement. It's a talent rarely enjoyed and much appreciated.  You <i>succinctly</i> stated your case and sat down to great applause, not to mention great relief.</p><p class="long">The adverb <i>succinctly</i> derives from the Latin <i>succinctus</i>,"to gird from below, or gather up one's clothes."  It  referred to gathering together loose clothing and cinching it with a belt.  Speaking succinctly reduces the volume of a speech to the main idea, like a belt might reduce the visual volume of an outfit.  If your audience seems to be drowning in a pile of verbal fabric, you need to speak more succinctly.</p></div></div>`;
