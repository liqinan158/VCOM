Often, <i>valuable</i> things are worth money, but a spy can provide <i>valuable</i> information that might save lives.</p><p class="long">When you use this word as a noun — "Were any valuables taken during the robbery?" — you usually are referring to things that are worth money: jewelry, electronics, etc. As an adjective, the word covers more territory. A person can be a <i>valuable</i> addition to a team if she helps it win. The most valuable things in life have nothing to do with money: friends, family, good health. If it is something we want, need, or respect, then it is valuable.</p></div></div>`;
