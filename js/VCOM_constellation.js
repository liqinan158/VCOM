A <i>constellation</i> is a group of stars that forms a pattern and has been given a name based on its shape.</p><p class="long">The visible night sky is divided into 88 constellations by astronomers. Organizing the stars into specific shapes and patterns helps when people study them, since they're broken down into manageable sections. A constellation can also be a cluster of things, like a constellation of freckles on your friend's nose. The <i>stella</i> in the middle of the word <i>constellation</i> means "star" in Latin, while the entire word means "set with stars."</p></div></div>`;
