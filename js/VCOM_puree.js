To <i>puree</i> something is to blend, chop, mash, or strain a food until it reaches this soft consistency. If it tastes like mush, then it's a <i>puree</i>!</p><p class="long">You might think of purees as baby food, and it's true that a vegetable or fruit puree is the perfect first food for a baby to eat before she has teeth. There are plenty of things that adults like to puree too, though, like chickpeas (to make hummus) and avocados (to make guacamole). <i>Puree</i> is from the French <i>purée</i>, "pea soup."</p></div></div>`;
