People who come from Greece describe themselves as Greek, and stories of ancient Greek gods are still told thousands of years later. If you find something incomprehensible, you might say, "It's Greek to me," from a Latin phrase commonly used by medieval scribes copying illegible transcripts: <i>Graecum est; non legitur</i>, "It's Greek, and impossible to read."</p></div></div>`;
