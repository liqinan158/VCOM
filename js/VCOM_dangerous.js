When Geoffrey Chaucer wrote "The Canterbury Tales" in the 1300s, he used <i>dangerous</i> to mean "hard to please." Gradually the meaning changed, so that by the late fifteenth century, <i>dangerous</i> meant "liable to cause hurt" or "risky." Just as popular were two other <i>danger</i>-related words that we don't use anymore today: <i>dangersome</i> and <i>dangerful</i>, which at the time could be used interchangeably with <i>dangerous</i>.</p></div>`;
