If you live on a busy street, you're bound to occasionally hear music <i>reverberating</i> loudly from passing cars.</p><p class="long">Your deep-voiced uncle might have a reverberating laugh that bounces around the room at every family gathering. And if your brother decides to teach himself to play the electric guitar, the constant reverberating sound of his amp may make you pound on your bedroom wall in frustration. When something reverberates, it resounds, or echoes in a deep, vibrating way. Both the verb and adjective are rooted in the Latin <i>reverberare</i>, "beat back."</p></div>`;
