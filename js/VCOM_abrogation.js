This is mainly a legal term. Abrogation occurs whenever an old law or rule is abolished, like when slavery was outlawed. The abrogation of a lease means it is no longer valid and binding. The annulment of a marriage — which legally wipes out the marriage, as if it never happened — is also a type of abrogation.</p></div></div>`;
