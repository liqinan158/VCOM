Most <i>mops</i> have a long handle and a sponge or bundle of absorbent strings on one end. If someone says that your hair looks like a <i>mop</i>, that's not a compliment.</p><p class="long">When you use a mop, you <i>mop</i> the floor. Mops can be used dry, but more often they're dunked in a soapy bucket of water before they mop the floor. You can also "<i>mop</i> up" a mess or a spill, even if you're using a cloth, a sponge, or a paper towel instead of a mop. The earliest mops were used to clean ships' decks, and the word comes from the Latin <i>mappa</i>, "napkin."</p></div>`;
