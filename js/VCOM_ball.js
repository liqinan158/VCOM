In fact, most sports involve a ball in one way or another. Another fun kind of ball is a grand party that usually includes dancing, food, live music, and guests dressed up in glamorous clothing. These two meanings have different origins â€” the "fancy dance" kind of ball comes from a Greek root, <i>ballizein</i>, "to dance or jump about."</p></div></div>`;
