If your best friend moves away but comes back to surprise you for your birthday, you'll probably react <i>jubilantly</i>, with laughter and hugs.</p><p class="long">Anything that's done jubilantly is full of so much happiness that you want to shout with joy and excitement. In fact, the Latin root is <i>iubilare</i>, "to let out whoops" or "to shout for joy." Use this adverb for things worth celebrating, like when you jubilantly announce to your family that you've won a major prize, or when your soccer team jubilantly celebrates finally winning a match after a losing streak.</p></div>`;
