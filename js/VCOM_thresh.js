Before the invention of machines to do this task, it took a huge amount of time to <i>thresh</i> grain by hand.</p><p class="long">To make this tedious task go faster, farmers used to thresh in groups, throwing threshing bees where neighbors worked together. Special sticks called <i>flails</i> were used to beat the seeds out of the grain, and it took about an hour to thresh a bushel of wheat. The threshing machine was invented in the late 1700s, and today most farmers thresh using a combine harvester, which harvests and threshes the grain right in the field.</p></div>`;
