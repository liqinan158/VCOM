It's the feminine diminutive form of <i>coq</i>, which means "cock, a male bird" â€” so <i>coquette</i> refers to a little female bird, and, in fact, it's also the name of a kind of colorful hummingbird found in Latin America. If you imagine a <i>coquette</i> as a flamboyant little bird flitting about and teasing the male birds, you'll have a good picture of a <i>coquette</i>.</p></div>`;
