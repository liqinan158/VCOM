If youâ€™re not sure you want to go somewhere, your friend might use <i>persuasion</i> to talk you into it.</p><p class="long">Being of a certain persuasion or belief, means you already have your mind made up, as a person who is of the Democratic persuasion or the Lutheran persuasion. Another meaning for persuasion is the act of influencing someone to do something or to change their mind. For example, good salespeople use persuasion to get people to buy things, just as children use persuasion to get permission to do certain things.</p></div></div>`;
