The <i>geriatric</i> ward of a hospital is specifically designated for elderly patients. You can bet they have some pretty lively bingo nights there.</p><p class="long"><i>Geriatric</i> often describes something related to the medical care of elderly people, like a geriatric hospital. When it’s used outside of a health care context, it takes on a sense of “feeble” or “decrepit.” It can be humorous if you use it about someone or something that's not actually old, like a group of middle-aged people calling their weekly cocktail gatherings the “geriatric club.” But if you call your grandparents’ golf buddies the “geriatric club,” they’d probably be offended.</p></div>`;
