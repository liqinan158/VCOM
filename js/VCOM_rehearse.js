You and your cast mates will need to <i>rehearse</i> for several weeks before you'll be ready to perform the entire two hours and forty-five minutes of the musical "Hamilton."</p><p class="long">A new teacher might rehearse before his first day teaching math to ninth graders, and you'll want to rehearse before you sing the national anthem on the field before a baseball game begins. If you're nervous about something, like asking someone to the prom, you might rehearse it in your mind. At the root of <i>rehearse</i> is the Old French word <i>rehercier</i>, which means both "go over again," and "rake and turn over the soil."</p></div>`;
