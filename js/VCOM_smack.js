Instead of giving your dog a <i>smack</i> for chasing the cat, you should speak calmly and firmly to him.</p><p class="long"><i>Smack</i> also describes the sound of a smack, like when your Frisbee hits your neighbor's house with a smack. It's a verb too: "I'm tempted to <i>smack</i> you for saying that about my brother." Sometimes, <i>smack</i> takes the form of a descriptive adverb: "I ran <i>smack</i> into the mailbox while I was texting and walking." Informally, a smack can also be a kiss, or an eager movement of the lips in anticipation of something delicious.</p></div></div>`;
