"<i>Justifiable</i> homicide," for instance, is killing someone in self-defense â€” a situation where an act that is otherwise criminal is "made just" by the circumstances. You can also use the word in a more positive sense. For example, you can take <i>justifiable</i> pride in winning the race even though you started off running in the wrong direction.</p></div>`;
