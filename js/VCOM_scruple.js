Your <i>scruples</i> won't allow you to cheat on a test, or steal from your brother's Halloween candy stash.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>scruple</i> comes from a Latin word, <i>scrupulus</i>, which means a small, sharp stone. Some say that the philosopher Cicero first used the word analogously to compare a worry to a small, sharp stone in your shoe that bothers you. From there the word <i>scruple</i> took on the ethical principles meaning. If you are doing something bad, your scruples will bother you â€” but emptying your shoe probably won't help.</p></div></div>`;
