Careful stitches might transect your grandmother's quilt, and a new highway might transect a historic city neighborhood. When you see the Latin prefix <i>trans</i>, you can be sure the word includes some sense of "across." In the case of <i>transect</i>, <i>trans</i> is combined with <i>sect</i>, from the Latin verb <i>secare</i>, "to cut."</p></div></div>`;
