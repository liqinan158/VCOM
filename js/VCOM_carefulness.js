When you write "FRAGILE" on a package you're mailing, you're hoping it will be handled with <i>carefulness</i> at the post office.</p><p class="long">In many cases, you can substitute this noun with the shorter <i>care</i>. But in some cases, <i>carefulness</i> is more accurate, implying "caution" rather than "loving protection." While your best friend is a daredevil, your carefulness in all situations makes the trampoline park slightly less fun for you. The Old English precursor to <i>carefulness</i>, <i>carfulnys</i>, originally meant "anxiety."</p></div>`;
