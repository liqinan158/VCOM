No matter how much you love your grandma, you probably don't enjoy it when she <i>pinches</i> your cheek and tells you how tall you've gotten.</p><p class="long">You can pinch your little brother when he's being annoying, and you can pinch an image on a touchscreen (to make it smaller or larger) by moving your fingertips the same way. <i>Pinch</i> is also a noun, meaning the act of pinching or the amount of something you can hold between your finger and thumb: "Add a <i>pinch</i> of salt to the soup." Informally, if you pinch something from a store, you steal it.</p></div></div>`;
