Giving your subway seat to an elderly man is a gesture of <i>goodwill</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Goodwill</i> can also be spelled as two separate words, good will, but either way it joins <i>good</i>, from the Old English word for "virtuous," <i>god</i>, and <i>will</i>, in Old English <i>willa</i>, or "wish." So when you wish someone well — when you feel friendly or compassionate — you have goodwill toward that person.</p></div></div>`;
