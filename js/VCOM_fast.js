Alternatively, and quite confusingly, <i>fast</i> also means to refrain from eating for a certain period, usually for religious reasons.</p><p class="long"><i>Fast</i> is another of those deceptively simple words that have a number of other meanings beyond their most common usages. If something "sticks <i>fast</i>" it means it cannot be removed — like a leech or a stain. "To stand <i>fast</i>" means not to give up your point of view or to remain loyal. Then there's also the slang meaning of living beyond the constraints of normal behavior — as in "the <i>fast</i> life," "the <i>fast</i> track," or "the <i>fast</i> lane."</p></div></div>`;
