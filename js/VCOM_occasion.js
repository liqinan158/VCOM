On <i>occasion</i>, we sit down together as a family, but not every day, and never for dinner. When Great Aunt Mabel visits, however, we rise to the <i>occasion</i> and stage a large family meal.</p><p class="long"><i>Occasion</i> can also mean a designated time or reason something happens, or it can be an event in itself.  I'm giving you your grandmother's ring on the occasion of your graduation from high school. I haven't had occasion to look at it since she died. It's valuable, so only wear it on special occasions.</p></div></div>`;
