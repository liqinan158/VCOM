That's <i>pepper</i>. If your soup is a little bland, try adding some salt and <i>pepper</i>.</p><p class="long">Pepper starts out as a tiny fruit called a peppercorn. Once harvested and dried, these are ground into a powder and become what we think of as pepper. Other kinds of pepper include white pepper, which is a variation on black pepper, and the vegetables known as peppers, including sweet bell peppers and spicy jalape√±o peppers. As a verb, <i>pepper</i> means "fill with scattered items," like the way you might pepper your essay with sophisticated vocabulary words to impress your teacher.</p></div>`;
