var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">cartel</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When groups band together to control the supply of a product for their best interests, that’s called a <i>cartel</i>. If you and the other kids running lemonade stands form a <i>cartel</i>, you can force up the price of lemonade.</p><p class="long">The word <i>cartel</i> originally referred to political parties that joined forces to promote a common cause. Over the years, <i>cartel</i> took on a decidedly negative connotation, and now it’s more likely to describe organizations that join together to limit supply of a product to force prices to remain high. You might read about an international drug cartel or a cartel of natural gas producers. To correctly pronounce the word <i>cartel</i>, put the accent on the second syllable: “car TEL.”</p></div>`;
