You might eat a <i>hunk</i> of cheese or play with a <i>hunk</i> of clay. If you call someone a <i>hunk</i>, you think heâ€™s hot.</p><p class="long">For a casual dinner you might just grab a hunk of bread off the loaf and dip it in beef stew, which is full of hunks of meat and potatoes. A completely different type of hunk is a handsome man: "When did your cousin turn into such a <i>hunk</i>?" Hubba hubba! This second meaning dates from around 1945, from African American slang.</p></div>`;
