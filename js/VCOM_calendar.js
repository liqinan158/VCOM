If you have something scheduled every day of the week, your calendar is full. In that case you might keep track of your dates with a calendar on your computer (or phone). Don't misspell it with an <i>er</i> ending, or you're referring to a machine that presses cloth. If you remember that "DAys" are in <i>calenDArs</i>, then you'll know to end it with a <i>DAr</i>.</p></div></div>`;
