It might be a family <i>tradition</i> to open Christmas presents on Christmas Eve, started because your parents were too impatient to wait.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>tradition</i> has Latin roots in the word <i>tradere</i>, which means hand over or hand down. So think of a <i>tradition</i> as something that is handed down from one generation to another. Fireworks on the Fourth of July are a national tradition, and playing your school's fight song at the start of the football game is probably a longstanding tradition designed to get the fans excited for the game.</p></div></div>`;
