Variations of <i>keen</i> as being "bold" and "strong" show up in other languages like Old Norse, German, Dutch, but apparently only English has the meaning of "sharp" — relating to "an edge or blade." <i>Keen</i> has a lot of close — and brutal — synonyms, such as <i>caustic</i>, <i>cutting</i>, <i>piercing</i>, and <i>penetrating</i>!</p></div>`;
