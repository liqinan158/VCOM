Parents often <i>swaddle</i> a crying newborn to soothe and comfort her.</p><p class="long">You can swaddle anything, if you wrap it snugly in a cloth — a child might attempt to swaddle his kitten, or his toy truck — but the verb is used most often to describe the technique of calming a baby with a tightly wrapped blanket. The word <i>swaddle</i> has been in use since the 1300's, and it was probably a form of the Old English <i>swaþian</i>, related to the word <i>swathe</i>, which has a similar meaning to <i>swaddle</i>.</p></div></div>`;
