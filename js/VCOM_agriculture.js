Someone who works as a farmer is in the <i>agriculture</i> industry.</p><p class="long">The Latin root of <i>agriculture</i> is <i>agri</i>, or "field," plus <i>cultura</i>, "cultivation." Cultivating a piece of land, or planting and growing food plants on it, is largely what <i>agriculture</i> means. Raising animals for meat or milk also falls under the category of <i>agriculture</i>. If we didn't have agriculture, we'd all be running around the woods, picking berries and trying to shoot things.</p></div></div>`;
