A <i>flagrant</i> foul in sports might send you to the bench, and a <i>flagrant</i> violation of the law might send you to the slammer.</p><p class="long">The current meaning of the adjective <i>flagrant</i> — "obviously offensive or disgraceful" — is thought to derive from the Latin legal term <i>in flagrante delicto</i>, which literally meant "with fire still blazing" and is used figuratively to describe a situation in which the criminal is caught red handed. Aside from a flagrant abuse of the law, the word can also be used to describe anything that is obviously bad — like flagrant bad taste or flagrant abuse of the rules of grammar.</p></div></div>`;
