An <i>apothegm</i> often expresses a fundamental truth or general rule.</p><p class="long">To correctly pronounce <i>apothegm</i>, put the accent on the first syllable and give it the short <i>a</i> sound, as in <i>apple</i>: "A-puh-them."  It comes from the Greek word <i>apophthegma</i>, meaning "terse, pointed saying," derived from <i>apo-</i>, meaning "from," and <i>phthengesthai</i>, meaning "to utter."</p></div>`;
