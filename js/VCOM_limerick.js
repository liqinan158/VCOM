Many <i>limericks</i> are dirty.</p><p class="long">When you study literature, you'll probably read some sonnets, sestinas, haiku, and plays written in verse: there might not be much attention given to limericks. That's because limericks are a more popular, non-literary form of poetry: they're mainly humorous and often sexual. A limerick has five lines and follows the rhyme scheme aabba, using what is called <i>anapestic</i> meter (which has to do with syllables). Many limericks involve a man from Nantucket, usually doing something unprintable with a bucket.</p></div></div>`;
