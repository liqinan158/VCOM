Another way to <i>jam</i> is to get stuck, and a <i>jam</i> can be a dense bunch of stuck people or things, like a traffic jam. If you play a musical instrument, you might jam, or casually improvise, with other musicians. And of course the jam you spread on your toast is a delicious, sweet fruit preserve.</p></div></div>`;
