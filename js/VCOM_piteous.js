The <i>piteous</i> cries of the orphaned kittens under your porch might convince you to climb under there and gather them up so you could feed them.</p><p class="long">Use the adjective <i>piteous</i> when you want to describe something that deserves your feelings of compassion and sympathy. A baby's cry, a miserable facial expression, and a pleading voice can all be piteous if they make you feel bad and want to help. The root word of <i>piteous</i> is the Latin <i>pietas</i>, meaning dutiful conduct or compassion. In Medieval Latin, it became <i>pietosus</i> and meant both merciful and pitiful.</p></div>`;
