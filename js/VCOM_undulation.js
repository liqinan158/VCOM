If so, you watched undulation, which is exactly that type of movement. <i>Undulation</i> best applies to waves, but it can also describe similar movements. If dancers are moving in a flowing manner, that's also undulation. The verb form of this word is <i>undulate</i>, and both come from the Latin word for "wave," <i>unda</i>.</p></div>`;
