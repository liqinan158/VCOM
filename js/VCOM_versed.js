If you’re well <i>versed</i> in Middle English literature, you know that Chaucer wrote <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> in 1475. Go you.</p><p class="long"><i>Versed</i> comes from the Latin word <i>versari</i> which means basically “to busy oneself, to be engaged.” If you’re versed (sounds like “verst”) in a subject, you’ve busied yourself with it and now you know it well. A history professor is versed in history. Someone with a massive comic book collection is probably versed in superheroes. Sometimes people say a person is well versed instead of versed, but either way, that person knows what they’re talking about.</p></div>`;
