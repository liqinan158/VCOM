A <i>tissue</i> is also a soft, thin piece of paper used for wiping noses and tear drops.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>tissue</i> comes from the Old French word <i>tissu</i>, meaning “a ribbon, or belt of woven material.” In fact, as a verb, <i>tissue</i> means "weave fabric strands." Today, we think of tissues as the disposable paper for blowing our noses or packing presents. A different kind of tissue is found in the body — the groups of cells that have the same job, like scar tissue that protects a wound as it heals.</p></div></div>`;
