You might help to paint the <i>backdrop</i> for your school's production of "The Sound of Music."</p><p class="long">The backdrop is an important part of a theater production, since it provides a setting for a play or sets a mood for a musical performance. If you're watching a local version of "Oliver!" the backdrop might be designed to look like a London street scene, for example. The noun <i>backdrop</i> comes from US theater slang, from a combination of <i>back</i> and <i>drop</i> around 1913.</p></div>`;
