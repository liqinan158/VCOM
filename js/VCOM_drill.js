The word is also a verb to describe the action a <i>drill</i> performs. For example, a dentist might <i>drill</i> into your tooth if you have a cavity.</p><p class="long">A carpenter's drill can be held in one hand, while an oil drill is a large rig that hollows out holes in rock through which oil can flow. To drill is to bore holes in a hard surface, and it's also to teach something by repeating facts over and over: "I hate math, because my teacher just <i>drills</i> multiplication tables." <i>Drill</i> has a Dutch root, <i>drillen</i>, "to bore a hole, turn around, or whirl."</p></div></div>`;
