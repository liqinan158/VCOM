So if you find a shiny, hard, dark piece of glass next time you’re hanging around a volcano, it’s probably a piece of <i>obsidian</i>.</p><p class="long">The word <i>obsidian</i> essentially means “stone of Obsius.” So who was Obsius? According to an ancient Roman writer, he was the guy who first found this type of stone in Ethiopia. You’ll find <i>obsidian</i> used as a modifier a lot. Think of an obsidian arrowhead, blade or mirror. Sometimes it is used as a fancy way of describing people’s eyes in romance novels as in, “Her eyes were dark and shining, two <i>obsidian</i> orbs.”</p></div>`;
