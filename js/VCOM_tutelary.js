You see this root in words like <i>tutor</i> and <i>tutorial</i>, which also involve watching over, though in a more specific sense that applies primarily to instructing. <i>Tutelary</i>'s suffix <i>-ary</i> means "having to do with." So something that is tutelary has to do with keeping watch, like the tutelary presence of a parent supervising a child, or even a tutelary god in an ancient society.</p></div></div>`;
