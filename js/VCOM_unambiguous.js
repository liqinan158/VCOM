var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">unambiguous</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If something is <i>unambiguous</i>, there are no two ways to interpret it. If your girlfriend burns all your letters, texts you that she hates you, and moves a thousand miles away, the <i>unambiguous</i> message is that she’s finished with you.</p><p class="long">If you're nervously reading the manual on how to trap the rattlesnake that's hiding under your bed, you'd hope the instructions would be <i>unambiguous</i> and tell you very clearly what to do. The word <i>unambiguous</i> gets its meaning from <i>un-</i>, meaning "not," combined with the Latin <i>-ambi-</i>, meaning "both ways," and <i>-agere</i>, meaning "to drive." So <i>unambiguous</i> is not driving in two directions — it's going full speed ahead, in just one direction, with only one meaning.</p></div></div>`;
