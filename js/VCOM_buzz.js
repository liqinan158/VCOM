Your dog might get nervous in your yard when she hears the <i>buzz</i> of insects.</p><p class="long"><i>Buzz</i> can be a noun or a verb: "My doorbell started to <i>buzz</i> like crazy when everyone showed up for my party." You can also talk about a buzz of activity, a low background noise, or describe the way stunt planes buzz the trees, flying very low. You might tell someone to "<i>buzz</i> off" if you're annoyed with them — this began in 1914 as a way to describe hanging up a telephone — or telling someone to hang up.</p></div></div>`;
