If you <i>petulantly</i> roll your eyes at your boss, you might risk losing that promotion.</p><p class="long"><i>Petulantly</i> is the adverb formation of <i>petulant</i>, which comes from the Latin word <i>petulantem</i>, meaning “wanton,” “forward,” or “insolent.” The modern use of <i>petulantly</i> has morphed to mean that one is moody or childish, and no longer means that one is wanton or forward. Acting petulantly won’t get you very far. People don’t usually respond well to children acting bratty, and it’s even worse when adults do it.</p></div>`;
