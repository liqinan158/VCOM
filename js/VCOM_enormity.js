If you call having to paint the house all by yourself an <i>enormity</i>, your friends might take pity on you and show up with brushes and rollers.</p><p class="long">Something that's enormous can be good — a huge paycheck! — or bad, such as a tumor. But when it comes to <i>enormity</i>, some word lovers are up in arms. The word originally meant "a crime," so some people think it should only be used to describe wickedness or lack of morals. Others can't resist the word's similarity to <i>enormous</i> and apply it to anything vast, positive or negative.</p></div>`;
