Eventually the bets themselves became known as <i>stakes</i>.  Today, you can use the word as a verb to describe any risky endeavor — for example, "Geoffrey <i>staked</i> his sandwich-making reputation on a six-foot hero with salami and pickles."  A stake can also be an investment.  If you say that "Bill has a <i>stake</i> in the business," it means he’s a part-owner.</p></div></div>`;
