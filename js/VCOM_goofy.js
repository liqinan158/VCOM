A goofy smile is sweet, unless youâ€™re in England where it means you have big crooked teeth. <i>Goofy</i>, the dopey Disney dog who is all of these things, was created in 1929 when the word was brand new. It comes from a variation on the English dialect <i>goff</i>, "foolish clown."</p></div></div>`;
