A <i>reproachful</i> look on your mom's face is a sign that you've disappointed her and might be in trouble.</p><p class="long">When you criticize your friend's decision to borrow her parents' car without asking, you probably sound reproachful. You might not even need to speak â€” a reproachful glance is sometimes enough to communicate your disapproval. When you <i>reproach</i> someone, you express disappointment in them, and to be <i>reproachful</i> is to be "full of reproach." The root word is the Old French <i>reproche</i>, "blame, shame, or disgrace."</p></div>`;
