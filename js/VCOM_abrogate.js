var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">abrogate</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Abrogate</i> means to abolish or avoid. When someone cuts in front of you in line, they are <i>abrogating</i> your right to be the next one served. When you cut in line, you are <i>abrogating</i> your responsibility to those who were in line before you.</p><p class="long">The Latin root of this word is made up of the prefix <i>ab-</i> "away" and <i>rogare</i> "to propose a law." What does it mean if you propose a law away? You repeal it, of course, so <i>abrogate</i> means to officially revoke, cancel or abolish. The meaning of this word has expanded a bit since its earliest usage, but it still appears most often in a legal or political context, or when serious rights and responsibilities are being discussed.</p></div>`;
