var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">umbrage</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When someone takes <i>umbrage</i> at something, they find it offensive, and it probably makes them angry.</p><p class="long"><i>Umbrage</i> comes from the same source as <i>umbrella</i>, the Latin <i>umbra</i>, "shade, shadow." The umbrella was invented to keep you in shade, and when you take umbrage at something, you're casting a shadow over the person or thing responsible for the offense. I take umbrage at the suggestion that I'm not a nice person: it's offensive and infuriating. After having devoted my life to helping animals, I might take umbrage at the notion that I've been doing it for publicity purposes: I resent the idea that it was for any other reason than my love of animals.</p></div>`;
