var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">ensnare</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>ensnare</i> something is to trap it. Instead of using snapping mousetraps, you might try to <i>ensnare</i> the mice in your kitchen and set them free outside.</p><p class="long">While you can use the verb <i>ensnare</i> to talk about literally catching something in a trap, it's also useful for more figurative kinds of traps. Your French teacher might try to ensnare you in becoming more involved in the French club, or rush hour traffic might ensnare you as you rush to make it to work on time. The word combines the prefix <i>en</i>, or "put in," and <i>snare</i>, with its Old Norse root <i>snara</i>, "noose or snare."</p></div>`;
