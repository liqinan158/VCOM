You might feel like a <i>handmaiden</i> when your parents tell you to scrub every bathroom in the house.</p><p class="long">Long ago, a handmaiden (also called a <i>handmaid</i>) often served as the personal servant or maid to the lady of the house. You're much more likely to encounter this word in a book or movie these days, since someone employed in a home is more likely to be called an <i>assistant</i>, a <i>housekeeper</i>, or a <i>cleaner</i>. The term <i>handmaiden</i> comes from the sense of being "close at hand."</p></div>`;
