The spinning blade of a blender is a <i>contrivance</i> that turns fruits and yogurt into a tasty smoothie. Yum.</p><p class="long">A contrivance is a useful device or tool. It might be assembled or invented, and it's often mechanical, although you can really refer to anything that's made for a specific purpose as a contrivance. The word sometimes also implies a falseness or obviousness, like the contrivance of a spy's very fake-looking beard that's supposed to disguise him, or the contrivance of a novel's complicated, unbelievable plot.</p></div></div>`;
