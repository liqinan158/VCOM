Airplanes also eat up fuel, and an expensive hobby like skiing can quickly eat up all of your savings if you're not careful. <i>Eat up</i> can literally mean "eat everything" as well, like when your grandmother sings out, "<i>Eat up</i>!" as she serves you a big plate of her famous broccoli casserole.</p></div></div>`;
