A cummerbund is a type of sash that's broad and pleated. Some sashes are worn over the shoulder, but a cummerbund goes around the waist. Though cummerbunds are now associated with higher classes of people, they were originally worn by less privileged classes in India. The word is from the Hindi for "waistband."</p></div>`;
