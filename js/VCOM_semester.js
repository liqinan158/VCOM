In September of your first year of high school, you could describe yourself as "a first-<i>semester</i> freshman."</p><p class="long">The noun <i>semester</i> comes up often when you're in high school and college. It's an easy way to divide the school year, into two equal halves, or semesters. Sometimes a class lasts for the whole year, and sometimes for just one semester. Occasionally schools split the year into three trimesters just to make things interesting. Originally, <i>semester</i> meant "six months," from the Latin root of the same meaning, <i>semestris</i>.</p></div></div>`;
