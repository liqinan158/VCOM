That means you dress up your house to celebrate the special occasion. <i>Decorate</i> is also used to describe certain kinds of success. A famous athlete might decorate a gym with trophies and championship rings. We say a person in the military, like a general, is decorated when he or she is given medals for bravery or other accomplishments.</p></div></div>`;
