It can also be an insult — a rude buffoon can be called a <i>clown</i>. To <i>clown</i> means to act goofy.</p><p class="long">The clowns found at circuses and birthday parties usually wear makeup and big shoes, but funny people in regular clothes are often called clowns, too, as in the class clown who tells jokes in school. Also, someone obnoxious can be called a clown, as in “that <i>clown</i> wrecked my car!” Acting like a clown in any way is clowning. A teacher trying to get the attention of kids who are fooling around might say, "Stop <i>clowning</i> around!”</p></div>`;
