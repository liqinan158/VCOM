If you decide to pack up your things and move to the remote island nation of Kiribati, that's <i>expatriation</i>.</p><p class="long">When a fairy tale king banishes a princess from the kingdom, it's one kind of expatriationâ€”you could also call it "exile" or "deportation." Then there's the expatriation that happens when someone chooses to move from one country to another. A U.S. citizen might attend college in Canada, then stay and become a Canadian citizen afterward, for example. <i>Expatriation</i> comes from the French <i>expatrier</i>, "banish," from <i>ex-</i>, "out of," and the Latin <i>patria</i>, "native land."</p></div></div>`;
