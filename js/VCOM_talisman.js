Your rabbit's foot key chain may be your lucky <i>talisman</i>. Of course, it wasn't so lucky for that rabbit.</p><p class="long">The word <i>talisman</i> has been around in English since the 1630s and it has roots in both Arabic and Greek words. A talisman is usually worn around the neck but could exist in other forms, like a ring or inscribed stone. You can think of a talisman as a good luck charm, but people tend to take talismans more seriously â€” as if they are empowered with magic to ward off evil spirits.</p></div>`;
