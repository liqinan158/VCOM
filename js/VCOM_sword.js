If you want to dress up as a knight for Halloween, you'll definitely need a <i>sword</i> â€” and maybe a suit of armor.</p><p class="long">Swords evolved from daggers, which, like knives, have two sharp edges instead of just one.

These long, sharp weapons were used by soldiers on battlefields, and for self-defense and dueling. <i>Sword</i> can be traced back to a Proto-Indo-European root meaning "to cut or pierce."</p></div>`;
