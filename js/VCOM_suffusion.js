The <i>suffusion</i> of red into your friend's cheeks will show you that she's embarrassed, for example.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>suffusion</i> is useful for talking about the gradual saturating of some substance or shade. You can watch the suffusion of tea from a tea bag into hot water, or sense the suffusion of excitement into a young boy on the day before his birthday. It's common to describe color with the word <i>suffusion</i> too, like the suffusion of pink into the evening sky at sunset. The Latin root is <i>suffusionem</i>, which means "a pouring over."</p></div>`;
