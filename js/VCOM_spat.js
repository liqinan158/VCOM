The <i>spat</i> is usually over something as silly as which partner has to do the laundry, and the relationship usually recovers quickly, with no long-term harm done.</p><p class="long">For the purposes of this definition, the noun <i>spat</i> refers to a minor argument or mild bickering. That is the definition by which <i>spat</i> is probably best known, but the word has other meanings. Depending on how you use <i>spat</i>, it can be the past participle of <i>spit</i>, the short piece of leather men wore over their shoes in the old days, or an oyster that hasn't quite reached its prime.</p></div></div>`;
