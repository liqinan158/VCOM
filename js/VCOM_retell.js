After they hear about how you actually slipped on a banana peel, your laughing friends may beg you to <i>retell</i> the incident over and over again.</p><p class="long">To retell is to reiterate something, or to tell it again. You might retell your favorite joke every time you have a new audience, or you may find yourself having to retell the details of a fender bender you witnessed once the police show up. When a writer takes up an old theme or story to put their own new twist on it, they retell it: "My goal was to retell the classic Cinderella tale in a modern way."</p></div>`;
