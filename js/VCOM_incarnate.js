The prefix <i>in-</i> means “in” and <i>caro</i> means “flesh,” so <i>incarnate</i> means “in the flesh.” The word can be used in positive or negative situations, but it always describes an unusual, possibly miraculous instance in which something that can’t normally be seen or touched assumes a bodily form. For example, the Christian religion was founded on the belief that Jesus was God incarnate.</p></div></div>`;
