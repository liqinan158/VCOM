Your parents might not want you to drop out of school to follow some fly-by-night dream, but if you're <i>earnest</i> about wanting a career in show biz, they'll support you.</p><p class="long">If you are earnest, you pursue your purpose in a steady, sincere, and eager way. The phrase <i>in earnest</i> uses <i>earnest</i> as a noun, as in, "Once you stop fooling around and start studying in earnest, you'll find you learn the material quickly." Oscar Wilde's classic play <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i> plays on the fact that Ernest is also a man's name.</p></div></div>`;
