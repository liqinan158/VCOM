When you're learning to sword fight for your role in a Shakespeare drama, the first thing you'll learn is to hold onto the <i>hilt</i>.</p><p class="long">The hilt of a sword is sometimes topped by a "pommel," an enlarged section of the handle, and protected by a "guard," which keeps your hand safe from your opponent's blade. The word <i>hilt</i> can also mean "totally" in the colloquial phrase "up to the <i>hilt</i>," as in: "That country's military is armed up to the <i>hilt</i>," or "They own lots of homes, but they're mortgaged up to the <i>hilt</i>."</p></div></div>`;
