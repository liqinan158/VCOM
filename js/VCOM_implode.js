With extremely large buildings, it helps to <i>implode</i> them rather than explode them, because by falling inward they take up less space.</p><p class="long">Why bother to have a word like <i>implode</i> when you already have <i>explode</i>? Well, imagine there is something deep beneath the sea, being subjected to the intense pressure there. If the pressure is high enough that the object bursts, it would collapse in rather than out. It would, in fact, implode. People also sometimes use <i>implode</i> to describe a person subjected to intense pressures who, emotionally at least, bursts inward: "All that stress just made Jess <i>implode</i>."</p></div>`;
