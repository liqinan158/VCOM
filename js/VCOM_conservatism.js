There are some who practice fiscal conservatism — which focuses on reducing spending and cutting budgets — while being more liberal socially. Social conservatism tends to favor things like traditional roles for women and men, and to object to major changes in society like same sex marriage. A person who embraces conservatism is called a conservative.</p></div>`;
