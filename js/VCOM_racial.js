When people talk about "<i>racial</i> diversity," they mean that many of these groups are represented, for example, in a single city. The noun <i>race</i> is at the heart of the adjective <i>racial</i>, and it comes from Old French, with an Italian root word, <i>razza</i>, "race, breed, lineage, or family."</p></div></div>`;
