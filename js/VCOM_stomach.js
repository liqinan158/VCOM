We also say people have a <i>stomach</i> for something unpleasant when they can handle it.</p><p class="long">Without a stomach, you'd be in trouble: that's where your food gets digested and turned into useful material your body can use for energy. If you ever got punched in the stomach or had a stomach ache, it can hurt a lot. Also, <i>stomach</i> can mean having a hunger, or at least tolerance, for something. If you can't stomach watching football, then you can't stand watching it. If you have a stomach for something, you can swallow it.</p></div></div>`;
