If so, that swirl of white chocolate is considered an <i>embellishment</i> â€” an unnecessary decorative detail designed purely to attract you. Also, can we have a bite?</p><p class="long">Anything can have an embellishment, not just a cupcake; a building can have an unnecessary decorative element, and so can an explanation or a story. There is often a sense of deception implied by the word:  it may be a harmless swirl of white chocolate but it can also be a detail designed to fool someone. Real estate agents are experts at adding embellishments to their descriptions of properties that may not be entirely true. Watch out for embellishments.</p></div></div>`;
