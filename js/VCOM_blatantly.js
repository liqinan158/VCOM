var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">blatantly</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">When you do something <i>blatantly</i>, you do it obviously, without trying to hide it. You might <i>blatantly</i> lie to your boss if you don't care about getting in trouble.</p><p class="long">Something done or said blatantly is bold and shameless. You might be doing something bad, but if you're doing it blatantly you're not worried about repercussions. In 1596, the poet Edmund Spenser invented the word <i>blatant</i>, using it to describe a slanderous beast. In the 1600s <i>blatantly</i> meant offensively loud, and by the late 1800s it had its current meaning of "conspicuously, obviously." A similar word is <i>flagrantly</i>, but you'd use it to mean "shockingly," while <i>blatantly</i> is closer to "obnoxiously."</p></div>`;
