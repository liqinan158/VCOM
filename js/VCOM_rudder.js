If your <i>rudder</i> is out of whack, you may end up somewhere that you don't want to be!</p><p class="long">A ship's rudder is a flat sheet attached to the stern (or back), that moves back and forth as the captain steers. It works by directing the water to move past the ship in a certain way, pushing the front of the vessel to the right or left. On an airplane, the rudder works the same way, but by directing the flow of air instead, so the plane turns to the left or right. The word <i>rudder</i> comes from the Old English <i>ro√∞or</i>, "paddle or oar," from a Germanic root meaning "tool for steering."</p></div></div>`;
