However, when <i>satiate</i> is used to describe eating, it can take on a more negative, or even disgusted, tone. If you comment that the diners at the world's largest all-you-can eat buffet were satiated, you might not mean that they were merely satisfied. You could be implying that they've been gluttons, and that they are now overstuffed with fried chicken wings and mac and cheese.</p></div></div>`;
