In other words, Fluffy was given a drug to calm her down or make her sleep.</p><p class="long">When doctors tranquilize a patient, it's usually to calm or relax the person before a medical procedure or after some trauma. It's more common to hear the verb <i>tranquilize</i> in the context of animal medicine or encounters with wild animals. For example, if a bear wanders into a suburban neighborhood, officials might use a dart gun to tranquilize it; they can then safely capture and relocate the bear. The root word, <i>tranquil</i>, comes from the Latin <i>tranquillus</i>, meaning "quiet."</p></div></div>`;
