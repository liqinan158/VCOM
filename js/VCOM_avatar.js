An <i>avatar</i> is something that embodies something else.</p><p class="long">In Hinduism the different gods can take many different forms, and when they took human forms, the human was their avatar. Eventually, the word <i>avatar</i> came to mean the embodiment not just of a god, but also of any abstract idea. If you have a cool head, you might see yourself as the avatar of reasonableness in a fight. Video game avatars are sort of a reverse of the first meaning––a physical entity (you) form becomes something abstract (a video game guy).</p></div>`;
