It makes sense.</p><p class="long">Since understanding something means you comprehend or get it, when things are understandable, they can be perceived or fathomed. If a friend cancels plans to see a movie because he's sick, that's understandable. Leaving one job for a better paying job is understandable. Eating a lot of cake on your birthday is understandable. Understandable things are easy to grasp and no one is likely to doubt or question them. The opposite of <i>understandable</i> would be <i>weird, odd,</i> or <i>inexplicable</i>.</p></div>`;
