You dared not light a match after you accidentally spilled gasoline on yourself because you knew you were <i>inflammable</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Inflammable</i> can be a tricky word, since the <i>in-</i> prefix often means "not." But in this case, the <i>in-</i> isn't really a prefix, because the word is built from the verb <i>inflame</i> which means "to set on fire." Some inflammable things might literally go up in flames, but we also use it metaphorically. Someone with a quick temper could be described as "inflammable," and if you fall in love easily, then you have an inflammable heart.</p></div></div>`;
