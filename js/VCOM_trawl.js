If you live in a coastal town, you might be able to watch the boats <i>trawl</i> at sunrise.</p><p class="long">When someone trawls, they don't use a fishing pole. This kind of fishing involves a boat that's rigged with a trawl moving through the water and pulling it behindâ€”trawling, in other words. It can be controversial to trawl, since the net can disturb the ocean floor and inadvertently catch endangered and non-edible fish. <i>Trawl</i> comes from the Middle Dutch <i>traghelen</i>, "to drag," and its Latin root <i>tragula</i>, "dragnet."</p></div>`;
