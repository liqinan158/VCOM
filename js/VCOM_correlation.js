How about daily flossing and good grades?</p><p class="long"><i>Correlation</i> derives from the Latin <i>cor-</i> 'together' and <i>-relatio</i> 'relation'––the word is all about things that go together. But beware: just because a study shows a correlation between two variables, it doesn't mean one necessarily causes the other. There is a significant correlation between going to high school and being a teenager, but that doesn't mean that going to high school <i>causes</i> you to be a teenager.</p></div>`;
