Your paycheck represents payment of your wages for the amount of time you worked. A lot of workers have their salaries deposited directly into their bank accounts, so they don't actually get a paper paycheck. You can also use <i>paycheck</i> more generally to mean "income" or "earnings," as in "All that money for health insurance comes right out of my <i>paycheck</i>."</p></div></div>`;
