Most pasta is made from semolina flour and water, and often eggs. The stiff dough is rolled very thin and then cut into shapes or long ribbons. It can be cooked from this soft, fresh state, or (more commonly) dried, packaged, and sold. <i>Pasta</i> is an Italian word (surprise, surprise), from Late Latin, which means "dough or paste."</p></div></div>`;
