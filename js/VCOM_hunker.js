When you're playing hide and seek, you may decide to <i>hunker</i> in the back of a closet until you're found.</p><p class="long">You hunker physically when you're hiding or making space for other people or squatting to talk to a small child. You can also hunker figuratively, like when you hunker down in your house during a snowstorm, waiting to venture out until the roads have been plowed. Another way to hunker down is to focus on a task and work extra hard. We know <i>hunker</i> is a Scottish word, but beyond that its origins aren't clear.</p></div>`;
