A character in a 19th century novel might lie abed all day before being diagnosed with scarlet fever, for example. <i>Abed</i> is rooted in the Old English <i>on bedde</i>, or "in bed, from the sense of <i>a-</i> meaning "on" — which is also found in words like "alive," "asleep," and "afoot" — and <i>bed</i>.</p></div>`;
