A newspaper article is <i>one-sided</i> if it presents just one opinion about a controversial topic.</p><p class="long">When television news gives a one-sided version of the facts, it's impossible for a viewer to get a clear picture of what's going on, especially when most political subjects have so many differing opinions. Another, much less controversial meaning of the adjective <i>one-sided</i> is simply "having only one side." You might be pleased to realize that your math test paper is one-sided, with questions only on the front.</p></div>`;
