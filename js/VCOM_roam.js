Book characters' eyes sometimes roam, too, or glance over a scene without stopping: "Her eyes <i>roam</i> across the group, but there are no familiar faces." Experts have tried connecting <i>roam</i> to "pilgrimages to Rome," but there seems to be no relation between <i>roam</i> and <i>Rome</i>.</p></div>`;
