The portrait you paint of your best friend is a <i>delineation</i> of that person.</p><p class="long">A <i>delineation</i> can refer to any kind of pictorial representation of something else, like a geometric sketch or a map of a city. A <i>delineation</i> more generally means any kind of accurate or vivid portrayal of something else. So, a lively summary of a book that makes the listener feel she read it herself can be a delineation. Telling someone else what you dreamed about last night is a delineation of that dream.</p></div>`;
