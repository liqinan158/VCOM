They're prepared for interacting with other people. When you first roll out of bed in the morning, you rarely feel very <i>presentable</i>.</p><p class="long">Before you head off to school or work, you'll want to glance in the mirror to make sure you're somewhat presentable. For some of us, this means a shower, a hair dryer, makeup, and carefully chosen clothing, while for others it means trading pajamas for a comfortable pair of jeans. Since the early 1800s, <i>presentable</i> has meant "appearing suitable" or "fit to be seen." Before that, it had a purely legal meaning, "liable to be charged with wrongdoing."</p></div>`;
