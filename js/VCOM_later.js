You can go to a movie <i>later</i> tonight.</p><p class="long">Later can also mean more recent, as in "Which is the later movie, <i>Gone with the Wind</i> or <i>Citizen Kane</i>?" It can mean toward the end: “He made that movie later in his career.” It can also mean after, as in "You were later than I thought you'd be!" It can also be used in comparison: "He was late; I was later." All these uses are about time, and how time keeps moving on from now to later.</p></div></div>`;
