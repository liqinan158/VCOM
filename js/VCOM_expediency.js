While its tone can be neutral, <i>expediency</i> often suggests self-interest, possibly at the expense of doing what's right.</p><p class="long"><i>Expediency</i> comes from the word <i>expedient</i>, which derived from the Latin <i>expedientem</i>, meaning "beneficial."  The negative aspect of the word came about in the 18th Century, taking on the aspect of doing something in the most convenient and advantageous manner, even though that way might be against conventional ethics.  As W. Somerset Maugham once wrote, “The most useful thing about a principle is that it can always be sacrificed to expediency.”</p></div></div>`;
