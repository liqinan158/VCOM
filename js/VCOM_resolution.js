If you lack determination, you'll never fulfill your New Year's <i>resolutions</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Resolution</i> is the noun form of the verb <i>resolve</i>, derived from the Latin <i>resolvere</i>, "to loosen, undo, settle." We can still see this meaning of resolution in the sense of "an explanation" or "a solution" â€” when a problem, conflict, or mystery reaches its resolution, it has been "undone," so to speak. If you approach a task with resolution, you do it with determination. And if you make a resolution, you make a firm decision to do something or meet some goal.</p></div>`;
