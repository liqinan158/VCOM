Anything <i>hospitable</i> is welcoming and open.</p><p class="long">A Greek proverb suggested that in being hospitable, the main feeling should be good will. The basis for the word <i>hospitable</i> is the Latin <i>hospes</i>, which refers to welcoming a guest, a word that evolved into  meaning "to entertain." Consider that being <i>hospitable</i> means, as someone once said, “making your guests feel at home, even though you wish they were.” In other words, entertaining them. (You can also “entertain” new ideas with an open, hospitable mind.)</p></div>`;
