A shrimp farmer works in the <i>aquaculture</i> industry.</p><p class="long">The word <i>aquaculture</i> combines the Latin <i>aqua-</i>, "water," with <i>culture</i>, also from a Latin root, meaning "agriculture" or "a cultivating." Originally, this term referred only to fish farming. Today, you can also practice aquaculture by growing seaweed and algae, or raising shellfish like oysters and scallops.
