A percent is calculated by comparing a part of something compared to the whole. A baseball player's batting average is a percent. Athletes are known for talking about numbers that are impossible, like "I gave 110 <i>percent</i>!" You can do that in slang, but don't try it in math class.</p></div></div>`;
