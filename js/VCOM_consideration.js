Treating others as you would have them treat you (the Golden Rule) is one example of <i>consideration</i>.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>consider</i> comes from the Latin for "contemplate," and hidden in the word is <i>sid,</i>, the Latin root for "star." Originally it meant to examine something very thoroughly, or carefully, as if you were staring at the night sky, contemplating its mystery. If you give something <i>consideration,</i> you think about it carefully, and not too quickly. When youâ€™re making a tough decision, you need to give <i>consideration</i> to all possible outcomes before making up your mind.</p></div></div>`;
