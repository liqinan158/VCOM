The runner got cold feet. This doesn't mean their feet were literally cold, but that they became filled with worry and anxiety over their decision. They second-guessed themselves and panicked. People often get cold feet in high-pressure situations, or when they're on the verge of following through on a plan. If you don't have cold feet, you're relaxed and confident in your decision.</p></div></div>`;
