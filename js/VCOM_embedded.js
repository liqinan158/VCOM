On a walking tour of Fredericksburg, Virginia, you can see buildings with <i>embedded</i> Civil War cannonballs.</p><p class="long"><i>Embedded</i> also means to insert as part of a whole. In wartime, embedded journalists are stationed with military units so that they can make first-hand reports on the news, and so that viewers can have a more in-depth understanding of issues facing the soldiers.
