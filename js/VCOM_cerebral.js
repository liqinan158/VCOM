You make decisions using your intelligence and cold, hard facts, instead of your emotions.</p><p class="long">The word <i>cerebral</i> gets its meaning from <i>cerebrum</i>, which is Latin for "brain." Cerebral people use their brains instead of their hearts. The cerebrum is a particular section of the brain, and anything related to that part is also cerebral, like in medicine. A cerebral hemorrhage, for example, means a hemorrhage has occurred in the brain â€” a phrase you'd never want to hear coming from a doctor.</p></div>`;
