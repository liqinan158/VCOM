A <i>neat</i> roommate is usually easier to live with than a sloppy one. And a <i>neat</i> mustache is probably better than a big bushy one.</p><p class="long">Your neat handwriting might have made you the pride of your third-grade teacher, and your neat hairstyle will pass muster with your ballet instructor (who insists on a very tidy bun on every dancer's head). You can also use the word <i>neat</i> to mean "great," "cool," or "super." <i>Neat</i> comes from the Old French <i>net</i>, "clear or pure," from the Latin <i>nitidus</i>, "gleaming." Since the 1930s, it's also meant "very good."</p></div>`;
