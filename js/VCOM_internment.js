During World War II, the American government put Japanese-Americans in <i>internment</i> camps, fearing they might be loyal to Japan.</p><p class="long">Internment usually doesn’t involve a trial, so you're being held because someone thinks you might be dangerous, but there’s no proof. The internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II is now widely considered to have been a terrible mistake, in that the citizens who were detained — some for as long as four years — were not traitors, but loyal Americans, and their internment caused them considerable emotional and economic hardship. <i>Internment</i> comes from the Latin <i>internus,</i> “inward.”</p></div></div>`;
