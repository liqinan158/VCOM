Many people associate <i>polka</i> music with the accordion.</p><p class="long">The origins of the polka go back to a Czech folk dance, and the word itself comes from the Czech <i>pulka</i>, or "half," a reference to the common "half-steps" in Bohemian dances. Polka spread to the wider Czech culture by the 1830s, and soon after to Paris, England, and the United States, where it was adopted as the "national dance" of U.S. Polish immigrants during the 20th century. It's also a verb: "Hear that music? Let's polka!"</p></div>`;
