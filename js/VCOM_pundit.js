Some TV news programs are nothing more than a bunch of <i>pundits</i> arguing about current events.</p><p class="long">Why not just call them experts? Because <i>pundit</i> is a lovely word that is very close to its Sanskrit root, <i>payndita-s</i>, "learned man or scholar." Originally, a <i>pundit</i> was a "learned Hindu" or Sanskrit expert. Today's classic examples of the pundit are guests on talk radio and professional sports commentators, all brilliant dispensers of insights, statistics, and occasional hot air.</p></div>`;
