You might have heard your parents say things like, "I <i>forbid</i> you to play ball in the house!" or "I <i>forbid</i> you to have any more parties when we're not home!"</p><p class="long"><i>Forbid</i> comes from the Old English word <i>forbeodan</i>, meaning "forbid, prohibit." <i>Forbid</i> can also mean "prevent" or "keep from happening." The spare tire on your car will <i>forbid</i> you from driving any faster than 40 miles an hour â€” any faster and the car will shake. You may have heard <i>forbid</i> used in the expression "God forbid . . ." This refers to something you hope will not happen, so much so that you're asking God for a little help.</p></div></div>`;
