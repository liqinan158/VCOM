Even if you cannot yet bench-press your 500-pound goal, keeping a written log of your workout schedule at least ensures that your fitness efforts are <i>documented</i>.</p><p class="long">Documented evidence is often in writing, but not always. If you think your little sister is helping herself to your allowance, you can create a documented case by recording a video of her breaking into your piggy bank. <i>Documented</i> can also describe an event or a discovery that has been proven â€” such as "the documented discovery of a dinosaur fossil in your backyard."</p></div></div>`;
