The coolest thing about the Internet is how <i>interactive</i> it is. You're constantly putting information and getting other information back.</p><p class="long">Think of <i>interactive</i> as the adjectival version of the verb "to interact." The <i>inter-</i> part of the word means "between, together, among," while the <i>act-</i> part means "to do." Put them together, and you get "to do together or among." Turn that verb into an adjective, and you get <i>interactive</i>. Interactive games are the most fun, because the more you and the game interact, the more interesting it is.</p></div>`;
