That’s the question asked by anyone who senses the futility of something.  The futility of war makes soldiers put down their weapons, and your father’s strict rules makes any protest an act of futility.   The root word is the Latin <i>futilis</i>, which literally means “leaky.”  Imagine pouring lemonade into a cup that has no bottom.  No matter how long you pour, you’ll never get a sip because of that leaky cup.  Ah, the futility!</p></div>`;
