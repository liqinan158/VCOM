Another name for a <i>bulrush</i> is a cattail.</p><p class="long">If you hike near a marsh, you may see bulrushes poking up above the other grasses growing there. A bulrush tends to have a long, rounded seed head at its very top, and wide, strong leaves that can be used for weaving. The noun <i>bulrush</i> combines <i>rush</i>, "plant growing in marshy ground," with <i>bul</i> or <i>bull</i>, most likely used in the sense of "very large or coarse," as in the word <i>bullfrog</i>.</p></div>`;
