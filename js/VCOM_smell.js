Dogs have such a sharp sense of <i>smell</i> that they can sniff out things like explosives and drugs.</p><p class="long">Your sense of smell gives you important information, like "this milk is sour," or "I need a shower." An individual odor or scent is also a smell, and to perceive it with your nose is to smell it. If someone says, "You <i>smell</i>," it's not a compliment—what they mean is, "You don't <i>smell</i> good." While experts believe that <i>smell</i> has an Old English root, it was never recorded.</p></div>`;
