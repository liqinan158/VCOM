Hooking up words and phrases and clauses." These lyrics from Schoolhouse Rock sum it up: a <i>conjunction</i> is all about joining things together.</p><p class="long">The words <i>and</i>, <i>but</i>, and <i>or</i> are conjunctions, linking words and phrases together to form sentences. Other kinds of conjunctions bring groups together, such as organizations working in conjunction to present a big event; or bring objects together, like a conjunction in a house's plumbing system where pipes meet. <i>Conjunction</i> could also mean things happening at the same time, such as free Schoolhouse Rock screenings that are presented in conjunction with a National Grammar Day celebration.</p></div>`;
