When you hear the <i>ding</i> of the doorbell, you'll know that the pizza delivery guy is here.</p><p class="long">Bells, telephones, and doorbells all make a ding, and the word is a verb as well: "I'm going to run when I hear the dinner bell <i>ding</i> — I want to be first in line." Another kind of <i>ding</i> is a small dent or nick in a surface, the kind you might get in your car's bumper during a minor fender bender. <i>Ding</i> falls in the category of imitative words, which sound like their meaning.</p></div>`;
