That was back when people thought that "bodily humors" like blood were responsible for your attitudes. Now that we no longer believe in humors, <i>sanguine</i> has settled down as a fancy way to say someone is cheerfully confident.  Experts are frequently described as feeling sanguine about a political or economic situation — or not sanguine, if they think we're going to hell in a handbasket.</p></div>`;
