Partly because animal skin vellum is so expensive to produce, it's rare these days. Some sacred texts are still printed on the very fine, thin hides of cows, including Torah scrolls. The British Acts of Parliament also continue to be printed on animal vellum. The word <i>vellum</i> shares a root with <i>veal</i>, or "calf meat."</p></div>`;
