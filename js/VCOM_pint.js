A US liquid <i>pint</i> is the same as sixteen ounces — you could order a <i>pint</i> of iced coffee at your local cafe, but it may just confuse the barista.</p><p class="long">The term <i>pint</i> is more familiar in Britain than the US, although it's used to measure goods in both places. If you order a pint in a pub, you'll get a large glass holding one fluid pint of beer, and in the UK you can also buy pints of milk. British pints are larger than their US counterparts, though — both countries consider a pint to be one-eighth of a gallon, but an Imperial gallon (in Britain or Ireland) is larger.</p></div></div>`;
