If you say you love eating raw eggs, you may have to <i>prove</i> it by chugging a few. When someone asks you to <i>prove</i> something, you need evidence, also known as proof.</p><p class="long"><i>Prove</i> comes from the Latin root <i>probare</i>, "to test or prove worthy." The wordâ€™s meaning is clear in this quote from writer Ernest Holmes: "There was a time when a man was so convinced that the world was round that he was determined to prove it." As a transitive verb, <i>prove</i> requires an object to receive the action, as in "How can you prove your claim?" It can also be intransitive, as in "You might prove to be right."</p></div>`;
