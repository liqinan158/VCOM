Other kinds of hits include bombs, bullets, or missiles striking targets; assassins or "hitmen" killing someone for pay; and reaching a certain goal, like when you hit a high note or your income hits six figures. You can also colloquially "<i>hit</i> the road," or get going; and "<i>hit</i> up" your friend for five dollars, or ask to borrow it.</p></div></div>`;
