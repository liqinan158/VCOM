The prefix <i>retro-</i> means “back," and <i>spect</i> is a component of the words <i>inspect,</i> <i>spectator,</i> <i>spectacles,</i> and <i>perspective,</i> among others, which all have to do with looking or seeing. So it makes sense that <i>retrospect</i> means to look back in time, or to remember.</p></div></div>`;
