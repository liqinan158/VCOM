In other words, a <i>chiropodist</i> is a podiatrist.</p><p class="long">If your heel hurts or you have a broken foot, who should you call? A chiropodist, of course. If you've never heard of a chiropodist, that's because this word, especially in American English, has been nearly eclipsed by its synonym <i>podiatrist</i>. The two words share the Greek root <i>pod-</i> (meaning "foot"). A chiropodist was originally a hand and foot doctor, but in many parts of the world today <i>chiropodist</i> is used instead of <i>podiatrist</i> to designate a foot doctor.</p></div>`;
