It’s a good idea not to get too friendly with one, especially if you’re covered in delicious-smelling spices.</p><p class="long">The word <i>cannibal</i> comes from the Spanish word <i>caníbalis</i>, which was Christopher Columbus’s version of the word <i>Caribs</i>, the name people from the Caribbean called themselves. They meant <i>Carib</i> as in “brave ones” so something got lost in translation! Most cannibals are fictional — like Queequeg from <i>Moby Dick</i> or Hannibal Lecter from <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>. This word can apply to animals that eat their own kind: for example, the cannibal shrimp eats other shrimp. Ew.</p></div></div>`;
