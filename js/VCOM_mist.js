Light rain can sometimes form a <i>mist</i> that makes it hard to see the road when you're driving.</p><p class="long">The mist you see in the air on a damp spring morning is similar to the mist you spray when you water your plants â€” it's made up of tiny water droplets. As a verb, <i>mist</i> means "to cover with <i>mist</i>," so you might mist your dry plants or watch your windows mist up in the rain. <i>Mist</i> can also refer to a general dimness or cloudiness: "She watched through the <i>mist</i> of her tears."</p></div></div>`;
