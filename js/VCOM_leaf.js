In the fall, the <i>leaves</i> of many trees turn various bright colors before falling to the ground. In the spring, trees grow new <i>leaves</i>. Ahhh, the circle of life.</p><p class="long">A plant's leaves are the organs that take part in photosynthesis, which brings it needed nutrients. From this botanical meaning comes another definition of <i>leaf</i>, "a sheet of printed paper or a page in a book." And when you leaf through a book, you turn its pages. You might also "tremble like a <i>leaf</i>," or shake with fear; or "turn over a new <i>leaf</i>," start a new part of your life with new resolutions or attitudes.</p></div></div>`;
