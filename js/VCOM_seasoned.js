They have lots of experience, and they can handle just about anything that comes their way.</p><p class="long">To become seasoned takes a long time, because it means you are an old pro — someone who has dedicated years to a specific skill or activity. A seasoned hiker can tell you the fastest path up any mountain, and a seasoned bowler spends hours practicing in order to bowl strikes every time. <i>Seasoned</i> can also describe food that is full of herbs and spices, like the heavily seasoned French fries that seasoned bowlers eat at a bowling alley.</p></div></div>`;
