You've probably seen the word on a box of <i>granulated</i> sugar and not thought twice about the fact that, besides its granular form, sugar exists as a liquid and also inside sugar cane.</p><p class="long">Sugar, of course, is not a grain. A grain is rice, wheat, quinoa, corn––seeds that form the basis of most people's diets.
