If you're a language <i>purist</i>, it upsets you to hear someone using bad grammar.</p><p class="long">Most purists are fans of tradition and traditional rules, always sticking to those rules themselves and often instructing other people to do the same. To be a purist is to be a kind of perfectionist — a baking purist might feel that cookies made without a certain brand of chocolate chips are vastly inferior, for example. The noun <i>purist</i> originally referred specifically to language use, and it comes from the Latin <i>purus</i>, "clean, clear, or unmixed."</p></div>`;
