If the lifeguard says the water is <i>rife</i> with jellyfish, you're not going to want to swim in it.</p><p class="long">Not to be confused with the word <i>ripe</i> (“fully developed”), <i>rife</i> means “abundant” or “prevalent.” <i>Rife</i> can follow the word it’s describing, as in “corruption was rife during his administration.” More commonly, however, <i>rife</i> comes before the word it modifies, accompanied by the preposition <i>with</i>, as in “the class was rife with yawns” or “her story was rife with inconsistencies.”</p></div>`;
