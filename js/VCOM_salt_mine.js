If your mom groans, "Off to the <i>salt mine</i>" as she leaves for work, she probably doesn't love her job.</p><p class="long">The literal definition of <i>salt mine</i> — a mine where salt is extracted — explains the origin of the figurative meaning. Work in a salt mine is physically challenging and monotonous, and any job that feels that tedious can be called a salt mine. People sometimes use the term in a more lighthearted or joking way: "It was a great weekend, but tomorrow it's back to the <i>salt mine</i>."</p></div></div>`;
