Or, maybe you just like being a <i>peripatetic,</i> a walking wanderer.</p><p class="long"><i>Peri-</i> is the Greek word for "around," and <i>peripatetic</i> is an adjective that describes someone who likes to walk or travel around. <i>Peripatetic</i> is also a noun for a person who travels from one place to another or moves around a lot. If you walk in a circle, you are peripatetic, or walking, but you arenâ€™t a peripatetic, or wanderer, unless you actually go somewhere.</p></div></div>`;
