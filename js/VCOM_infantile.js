Thumb-sucking and temper tantrums are examples of <i>infantile</i> behavior.</p><p class="long">Doctors use the word <i>infantile</i> just like you'd expect: to describe things having to do with infants or babies. The rest of us, though, generally use this adjective when someone's being a brat or a crybaby or otherwise behaving immaturely. If someone refers to your sense of humor or your style of argument as "infantile" they are not offering you a compliment. They might be trying to tell you to "grow up."</p></div>`;
