Think of the irritable old guy who lives on your street and always seems to be simmering with some sullen nasty anger, whose every utterance he spits out with a rude snarl. He's the poster boy for <i>surly</i>.</p><p class="long">Surly behavior is always frowned upon, but the word's origins are in the behavior of English nobility. <i>Surly's</i> roots are in <i>sirly</i>, as in <i>sir</i>, meaning arrogant, haughty, and superior. Its current meaning implies all that and more, none of it appealing â€” rude, snotty, sullen, mean and cranky can be added to the list. Generally speaking, if you find yourself in a surly mood, avoid your friends and loved ones.</p></div></div>`;
