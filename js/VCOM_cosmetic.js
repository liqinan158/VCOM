Visit the <i>cosmetics</i> department of a store if you are looking to buy lipstick, and visit a <i>cosmetic</i> surgeon if you are looking to buy new lips.</p><p class="long">The word <i>cosmetic</i> has to do with beauty and appearance. Cosmetic surgery makes someone look better, but isn't necessary medically, like heart surgery. A cosmetic change to a building only changes the buildingâ€™s appearance. Cosmetic often means the same as decorative or ornamental. Also, cosmetics are items used to adorn, especially women, such as nail polish, lipstick, and eyeliner. All uses of <i>cosmetic</i> have to do with what's on the outside, not what's on the inside.</p></div>`;
