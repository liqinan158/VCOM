Fencing might seem like a breeze, but it actually takes the graceful <i>coordination</i> of your hands, eyes, feet and mind.</p><p class="long">Some people like to put a dash in <i>co-ordination</i>. But whatever way you spell it, <i>coordination</i> has to do with coordinating things â€” whether it's pulling all the elements together for a fabulous party or just getting your hands and eyes to work together during batting practice. If you're looking for more coordination in your life, try organizing your calendar, doing some yoga, or getting a personal assistant.</p></div>`;
