You feel <i>grief</i> if something terribly sad happens, like if your dog dies or if your childhood sweetheart breaks up with you.</p><p class="long">The word <i>grief</i> comes from the Latin word <i>gravare</i>, which means to make heavy. <i>Gravare</i> itself comes from the Latin word <i>gravis</i>, which means weighty. So think of <i>grief</i> as a heavy, oppressive sadness. We associate it most often with mourning a loved one's death, but it can follow any kind of loss.</p></div></div>`;
