Not only are your two cats <i>different</i> breeds, but they are also <i>different</i> from your pet tiger.</p><p class="long">Often followed by the word <i>than</i> or <i>from</i>, <i>different</i> describes something that contrasts with, or differs from, something else. With roots in the Latin <i>differre</i>, meaning “to set apart,” <i>different</i> can also describe something that belongs in a whole other category. More recently, the word has picked up an additional sense — for something that is special or unique, in an extraordinary or sometimes negative way. That tie your dad has with the different kinds of peppers on it is definitely... different.</p></div></div>`;
