Your first apartment might not be beautiful or spacious, but it's <i>livable</i>.</p><p class="long">A renter might make her little house more livable by hanging curtains and painting the dark walls in lighter colors, and an animal shelter might need to make their kennels more livable for dogs, with soft beds and plenty of fresh water. Another way to use this adjective is to mean "worth living," as when you say, "Even when my job isn't going well, my family makes life <i>livable</i>."</p></div>`;
