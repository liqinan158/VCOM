After all, it wouldn't be nice if an accident were to happen on the way to court, right?</p><p class="long">Technically speaking, <i>suborn</i> doesn't just mean induce someone to conveniently "forget" something in the witness stand, or otherwise get creative with their imagination. An inducement to any kind of crime is suborning, but by far the most common use is in the legal sense above. Or "witness tampering," as the cops call it.</p></div>`;
