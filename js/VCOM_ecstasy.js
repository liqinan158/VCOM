It happened to John Donne, whose poem “The Ecstasy” is about the feeling of the whole world vanishing when he looks into his lover’s eyes.  Sometimes an artist sees a stunning landscape that causes such ecstasy that she has to turn it into a painting. <i>Ecstasy</i> can mean a feeling or it can also be a state of being, so you might say, “I’m in ecstasy because this pumpkin pie tastes so delicious!”</p></div></div>`;
