While the word is derived from the word <i>human</i>, the sad fact is that a person can be <i>human</i> without being <i>humane</i>. Britain's Royal Humane Society, created in 1774 to rescue drowning people, focuses on recognizing acts of human bravery. In the United States, however, the <i>Humane</i> Society works to eliminate cruelty to animals. Still, both focus on kindness and the <i>humane</i> care of others.</p></div></div>`;
