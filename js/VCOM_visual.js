Anything you can see falls under the heading of <i>visual</i>. What "aural" is to the ears and "olfactory" is to the nose, <i>visual</i> is to the eyes.</p><p class="long">It's often said that "film is a <i>visual</i> medium"; it uses pictures to tell a story. You have to see it to get it. That's clearly different from, say, radio which can only use audio. Have you ever closed your eyes while watching a cartoon? If you cut out the visual parts and just listen to the music and sound effects, it's often even funnier. As zany as the sounds are, they're even funnier when you separate them from their visual cues. <i>Visual</i> shares its root with <i>vision</i>, which is (not surprisingly) the ability to see. How visual!</p></div></div>`;
