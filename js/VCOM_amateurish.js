Your <i>amateurish</i> attempt at baking might result in a lopsided pink cake, for example.</p><p class="long">If your handmade dress is amateurish, it won't look like you bought it in a department store. When a brand new teacher makes an amateurish try at getting his class's attention, he doesn't exactly sound like an authority figure. At the heart of <i>amateurish</i> is the noun <i>amateur</i>, or "beginner." The oldest meaning of <i>amateur</i> is "lover of something," from the Latin amatorem, "lover," although by the late 1700's it came to mean "dabbler," or not a professional.</p></div></div>`;
