Any comparison to Proust is usually based on the seven-volume "Ã€ la recherche du temps perdu," or "In Search of Lost Time." A "<i>Proustian</i> memory" is a brief, vivid, sense memory, especially one involving taste, based on the childhood memories that flood Proust's narrator when he eats a madeleine cookie dipped in tea.</p></div>`;
