If you wipe out on your bike and land on the <i>pavement</i>, you may end up with skinned knees or scraped elbows.</p><p class="long">When pavement is newly surfaced or patched, it's smooth and even â€” but after a long, cold winter pavement is often full of potholes and cracks. In the US, <i>pavement</i> most often refers to a road or street, but it can also mean any paved surface, like a sidewalk or paved area in a park. The word has a Latin root, <i>pavimentum</i>, "level surface that's been beaten firm."</p></div>`;
