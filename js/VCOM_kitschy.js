Your grandma's paintings of big, sad-eyed clowns could be politely described as <i>kitschy</i>.</p><p class="long">While many kitschy things are considered to be in bad taste, vulgar, or gaudy, there are many who appreciate the emotional overkill of truly kitschy collectables and art. If you're one of these people, you'll browse happily for hours in a kitschy thrift store, eventually leaving with a print of dogs playing poker or Elvis painted on velvet. <i>Kitschy</i> is from the German word <i>kitsch</i>, "gaudy" or "trash."</p></div></div>`;
