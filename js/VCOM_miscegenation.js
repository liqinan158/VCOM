var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">miscegenation</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If a country has laws against <i>miscegenation</i>, that means they have laws against people of different races having children. If a Chinese person and an Ecuadorian person have a child, that would be considered <i>miscegenation</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Miscegenation</i> combines the Latin <i>miscere</i>, meaning  “mix,” with <i>genu</i>, meaning “race,” plus the suffix <i>-ation</i>, which describes an action or process. So miscegenation means "a mixing of racial groups," like when people of different races live together or have kids together. If you read about the history of the American Civil War, you'll surely come across this word, which only came into English around that time. It's associated with offensive racist ideas of racial purity, so be careful using it.</p></div>`;
