See the base <i>gust</i> — as in "a gust of wind" — and you'll get more than a hint as to what <i>gusty</i> means. <i>Gusty</i> typically relates to the weather — describing blustery winds, sudden outbursts, strong on-again/ off-again blasts of cold air. Go outside the box and use it to depict a person's stormy, emotional behavior, especially if he has quick, sudden outbursts: "He was given to <i>gusty</i> behavior whenever you mentioned her name."</p></div></div>`;
