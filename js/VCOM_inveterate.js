In Middle English the word was associated with chronic disease. Now it simply refers to something that is a signature habit with a person. If you’ve loved books ever since you were a toddler, and you regularly check out big stacks from the library, you’re an inveterate reader. And if you're an inveterate nail-biter, nothing can cure you of the habit.</p></div></div>`;
