People look down on pedophiles more than other dangerous criminals because children are young, small, and vulnerable. Children need to be protected, not preyed upon. Even in prison — a place full of killers, thieves, and rapists — the other bad guys will usually hurt or even kill a pedophile.</p></div>`;
