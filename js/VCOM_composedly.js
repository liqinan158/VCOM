You might <i>composedly</i> repair a broken window before your parents get home, instead of getting upset like your younger brother.</p><p class="long">The adverb <i>composedly</i> is especially useful for describing something that's done in a way that displays common sense and a clear head. It implies calmness in the face of chaos, like when your aunt sits composedly with her cup of tea after firefighters have put out a fire in her kitchen. The root is the Old French word <i>composer</i>, "put together or arrange," from the Latin <i>ponere</i>, "to put or place."</p></div></div>`;
