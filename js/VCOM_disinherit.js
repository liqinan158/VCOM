Your eccentric grandfather might threaten to <i>disinherit</i> you because of your dirty fingernails.</p><p class="long">You need to have written a will — a document that lists where you want your money and property to go after your death — in order to disinherit someone. When your wealthy relative actually removes your name from her will, she officially disinherits you. The word <i>inherit</i> is at the heart of <i>disinherit</i>, with its old-fashioned meaning, "make someone an heir." When you add the Latin prefix <i>dis</i>, "not," you take away the inheritance altogether.</p></div></div>`;
