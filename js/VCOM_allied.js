To be allied means to have an agreement to work together, so when politicians are allied on a bill, they've pledged to join forces and unite for a common cause. In a war, allied countries are fighting on the same side. <i>Allied</i> comes from <i>ally</i>, which first meant "join in marriage," from the Latin root <i>alligare</i>, "bind to."</p></div>`;
