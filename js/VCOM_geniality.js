We show geniality when we are pleasant, kind, and nice to be around.</p><p class="long">People usually like other people who show geniality. Synonymous with <i>amiability</i> and <i>affability</i>, this word has to do with being friendly and approachable. Mean, scary people show no geniality at all. Smiling, giving compliments, laughing, listening to others, and helping out are all signs of geniality. If you think about the people you like, part of what you like is probably their geniality â€” they're congenial.</p></div>`;
