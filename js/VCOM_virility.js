You could demonstrate your <i>virility</i> by lifting a minivan, but why be a show-off?  Your <i>virility</i> also means that you'll need a minivan to cart around your many children.</p><p class="long">The Latin <i>virīlitās</i>, from <i>vir</i>, or "a man," is the base for the word <i>virility</i>.  You can also use <i>virility</i> to refer to "macho" qualities that might seem to reflect outdated notions of masculinity.  French feminist author Simone de Beauvoir once wrote, "No one is more arrogant toward women, more aggressive or scornful, than the man who is anxious about his virility.”</p></div></div>`;
