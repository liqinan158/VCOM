If you find it impossible to leave a book store without buying at least one book, you might be a <i>bibliophile</i>.</p><p class="long">A bibliophile usually has a huge collection of books and loves nothing more than browsing in a used book shop or a library. A love of books or a deep knowledge about them makes a person a bibliophile. The earliest use of the word <i>bibliophile</i> was in 1820s France, and it came from the Greek prefix <i>biblio</i>, or "book," and the word <i>philos</i>, or "friend." If you consider books to be your true friends, you are definitely a bibliophile.</p></div>`;
