A <i>disapproving</i> frown from a favorite teacher is often enough to make a boisterous first grader sit down quietly.</p><p class="long">Your mom's disapproving look at the dinner table might mean "Put your napkin in your lap," or "Don't talk about politics in front of Uncle Bill." Something that's disapproving conveys or expresses criticism or displeasure. <i>Disapproving</i> combines the prefix <i>dis-</i>, "the opposite of," with <i>approving</i>. from the Latin <i>approbare</i>, "to assent to or regard as good."</p></div>`;
