A <i>salon</i> is a good place to get a perm or highlights, to get your nails painted, or just to get a trim.</p><p class="long">A salon is like a barber shop, only fancier. Most salons offer all kinds of beauty treatments in addition to haircuts, like hair styling and coloring, facials, and massages. Another kind of salon is a formal living room â€” if you invited guests for tea, you might sit and sip it in your salon. The word <i>salon</i> is French, originally meaning "reception room." In 1800's France, the meaning grew to include a "gathering of elegant people" occurring regularly in such a room.</p></div>`;
