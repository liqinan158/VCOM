A couple has achieved <i>coitus</i> when they've had sex.</p><p class="long">This word may sound a little unusual to you because it's an old technical term for sex. Very few friends sitting around talking about sex will describe it as <i>coitus</i>, unless they're talking about The Big Lebowski, a movie that makes humorous mention of this old-fashioned term. Coitus may remind you of <i>copulation</i> and <i>fornication</i>: two other fancy words for sex.</p></div>`;
