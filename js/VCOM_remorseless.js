If you're <i>remorseless</i>, you don't feel bad at all — even if you've done something terrible.</p><p class="long">When someone is remorseless, that person has no feeling of pity for people who have been hurt. If you're remorseless, you have no conscience — essentially, you're cruel and ruthless. A remorseless killer doesn't care about her victim, and a remorseless critic doesn't worry about hurting someone's feelings with his harsh words. <i>Remorse</i> is regret, and it's rooted in the Latin word <i>remordere</i>, "to vex or disturb," or literally, "to bite back."</p></div>`;
