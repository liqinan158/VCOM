If you're a sound sleeper, you might <i>slumber</i> peacefully right through a thunderstorm, your <i>slumber</i> undisturbed.</p><p class="long">To slumber is to sleep, sometimes specifically to sleep lightly or doze. You can slumber in your bed, in your airplane seat, or through your alarm in the morning. <i>Slumber</i> can also describe a peacefulness, like your quiet street that seems to slumber early in the morning. The phrase <i>slumber party</i> was first used in the 1940s to mean a gathering held at night, that usually involves very little slumbering.</p></div>`;
