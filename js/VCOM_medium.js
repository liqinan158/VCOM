In clothing, we have small, <i>medium</i>, and large; in communications, it's what signals travel through from broadcast to receiver; and in spiritual terms, it’s a person who converses with the dead.</p><p class="long">The word <i>medium</i> — from the Latin adjective <i>medius</i>, "middle" — has several meanings that all center on the idea of being in between. From the air that carries the broadcast signal, to the person who transmits messages from the dead, to the measurement of the "doneness" of your steak, <i>medium</i> means something that lies between two other points, people, or levels.</p></div></div>`;
