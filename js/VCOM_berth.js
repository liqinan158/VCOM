If you're on an overnight train, you may want to spring for a <i>berth</i> instead of sitting up all night.</p><p class="long">You may have heard the phrase "to give someone a wide <i>berth</i> â€” that means to give them plenty of space. But if you want to use <i>berth</i> as a verb, you better be talking about parking a boat: to <i>berth</i> means to moor or dock a ship. The parking spot itself also happens to be called a <i>berth</i>. So if there's a big storm brewing, you best be sure to berth your boat securely in its berth.</p></div></div>`;
