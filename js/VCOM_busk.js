If you learn how to play the bagpipes, you could put on a kilt, go downtown, and <i>busk</i>.</p><p class="long">Unlike a concert with an admission fee, when a musician busks, she puts a tip jar nearby. Passers-by can donate money if they want to, but the music is free for those who can't or don't want to pay. In the 1800s, to <i>busk</i> was "to offer goods for sale only in bars and taprooms," probably from a nautical meaning of <i>busk</i>, "cruise like a pirate" or "live a shiftless life."</p></div>`;
