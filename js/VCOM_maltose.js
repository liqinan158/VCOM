var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">maltose</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short"><i>Maltose</i> is a sugar that forms when starches like potatoes or rice are broken down in the digestive system. After <i>maltose</i> is formed, it's broken into simpler sugars so your body can use it for energy.</p><p class="long">Most foods you eat don't have much maltose, unless you cook them. Sweet potatoes, for example, have no maltose when they're raw, but when they're cooked they have a small amount. Molasses and malted drinks like Ovaltine are some of the few uncooked food products that contain maltose. Otherwise, it forms during the digestive process. <i>Maltose</i> comes from <i>malt</i> and the chemical sugar suffix <i>-ose</i>.</p></div>`;
