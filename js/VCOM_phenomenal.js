Your sister's campaign to raise money for cancer research, which amassed a million dollars in two weeks? That's phenomenal. And Serena Williams, having won an unprecedented 23 Grand Slam titles, is without question a phenomenal tennis player. This extraordinary word comes from the relatively ordinary Greek <i>phainomenon</i>, "appearance," and its Proto-Indo-European root <i>bha-</i>, "to shine."</p></div>`;
