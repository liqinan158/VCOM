Your goldfish will probably feel right at home in the aquarium that's sitting on your desk, but a whale would be better off in a big aquarium where people buy tickets to see marine life.</p><p class="long">An <i>aquarium</i> can be small enough to fit in the average house, or big enough to house whales and accommodate millions of tourists each year. If you're talking about more than one of those tanks filled with fish and other marine life, you could say <i>aquariums</i>, but <i>aquaria</i>, from the original Latin term, is also an acceptable plural.</p></div></div>`;
