If you run a magazine about new technology, then you're constantly looking out for the next <i>innovation</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Innovation</i> comes from Latin <i>innovare</i> for renew, whose root is <i>novus</i> or new. It can be used for either the act of introducing something new, as in a company that rewards creativity and innovation, or something that is newly introduced, like an innovation in microchip design. It was once used politically in the sense of <i>revolution</i>, but now you're most likely to hear it in relation to technology, or new ways of doing something.</p></div>`;
