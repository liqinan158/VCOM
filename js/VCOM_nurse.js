To <i>nurse</i> is to take care of, like if you <i>nurse</i> a baby bird back to health.</p><p class="long">To become a nurse, you have to go to college and study subjects like anatomy and nutrition. Some nurses assist doctors and perform tasks like bathing patients, taking blood samples, or giving medication. When you use the word <i>nurse</i> as a verb, it means "care for," and also "breastfeed a baby." The Latin root, <i>nutrire</i>, means "to nourish." To nurse a drink is to drink it slowly, and to nurse an idea is to mull it over.</p></div></div>`;
