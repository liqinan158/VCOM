Found in both plant and animal cells, a <i>vacuole</i> is a fluid-filled pocket in the cell's cytoplasm that serves varying functions depending on the cell's requirements.</p><p class="long">Look at the word <i>vacuole</i>. Reminds you of "vacuum," doesn't it? That's because both words comes from the Latin word <i>vacuus</i>, which means "empty." In fact, <i>vacuole</i> comes from the French word that means "little vacuum." However, whereas a "vacuum" refers to an empty space, the vacuole usually contains a watery fluid.  It is a space in the cell that has no specific purpose, but usually functions as a storage bin for everything from water and food to waste products.</p></div></div>`;
