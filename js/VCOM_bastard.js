But now it's a more general insult hurled toward a jerk or bad person. <i>Bastard</i> can also simply mean "fraudulent."</p><p class="long">This is a great example of how words change in meaning over time. Today, if you were called a <i>bastard</i>, it probably has nothing to do with whether or not your parents are married: it just means someone doesn't like you (unless they call you a <i>magnificent bastard</i>, which is a compliment). <i>Bastard</i> can also mean phony or fake, like a bastard version of French that is not correct. When you think <i>bastard</i>, think <i>illegitimate</i>.</p></div>`;
