A magazine <i>quiz</i> might tell a reader if "he's into you," or a pop <i>quiz</i> in English class will let your teacher know how far you got (or didn't get) in last night's reading.</p><p class="long">As a verb, <i>quiz</i> means to ask a series of questions. A teacher might quiz his students on the material covered in lecture the day before. A mother might quiz her son as to his plans for after school. The questioning meaning of the noun and verb came into use in the mid-nineteenth century, possibly influence by words like <i>inquisitive</i>. Before that, <i>quiz</i> could refer to an odd or unconventional person, a meaning which eventually gave rise to <i>quizzical</i>, still in use today.</p></div>`;
