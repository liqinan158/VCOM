If someone in your family has had the flu, it makes sense to use a disinfectant when you clean the bathroom, just in case there are lingering germs on the doorknobs and faucets. Disinfectants are similar to antibiotics and antiseptics, except they're used on objects and surfaces rather than on (or in) our bodies.</p></div></div>`;
