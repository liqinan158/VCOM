The “organic” <i>designation</i> on the vegetables you buy lets you know that no pesticides were used in growing the plants.</p><p class="long"><i>Designation</i> can refer to a title, official or otherwise. You may earn the designation “class clown” for your goofiness, or ask your friends to refer to you by the designation, "Madame Super Brain." <i>Designation</i> is also the act of assigning such a title or position, like the designation of your daughter as heir to your estate. Often, <i>designation</i> refers to giving a formal position. The district board may be responsible for the designation of the next principal at your school.</p></div>`;
