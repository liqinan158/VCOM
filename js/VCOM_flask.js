Most <i>flasks</i> have a squarish body and a small neck for drinking or pouring. Don't try sneaking a <i>flask</i> into your tube sock.</p><p class="long">There are several different kinds of flasks, including a "hip <i>flask</i>," small enough to fit in a pocket, for carrying and surreptitiously sipping alcoholic beverages. Chemists use another type of flask in the laboratory, which has a wide bottom and a small mouth and is made of glass. And in Britain, a flask is also a vacuum-sealed container that keeps drinks hot, usually called a "Thermos" in the US.</p></div></div>`;
