Visiting relatives might <i>deplete</i> your refrigerator of food, or a pestering friend might <i>deplete</i> your patience.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>deplete</i> is used like “to drain.” A long, exhausting day can deplete your body of energy and a summer drought can deplete a region’s water supply. If you <i>de</i>plete your body of hydration after a lot of exercise, be sure to <i>re</i>plete yourself with a nice glass of water.</p></div>`;
