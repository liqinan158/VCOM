It might be hard for you to believe her when your sister tells you that her enormous pet snake is completely <i>harmless</i>.</p><p class="long">If your friend is scared of dogs, you can reassure her by saying, "Sure, he's 150 pounds and has a loud bark, but Fido is <i>harmless</i>!" Things that are safe or benign don't cause harm, and are therefore <i>harmless</i>, like your dad's harmless teasing or a compostable paper plate that's harmless to the environment. The word <i>harmless</i> originally meant "uninjured," or "not harmed," and came to mean "undamaged" by the end of the 1300s.</p></div></div>`;
