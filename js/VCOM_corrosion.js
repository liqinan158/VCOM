Although the word is most often associated with the physical breakdown of a metal through rusting, the erosion of rock by wind and water is a form of corrosion. The word can also be applied to other situations, like the corrosion of a once-strong friendship.  There could be corrosion of relations between two countries. Whenever something's being worn down or eaten away, you can call it corrosion.</p></div>`;
