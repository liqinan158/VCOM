When things, conversely, are inexplicit, they aren't clear or definite. After making an inexplicit agreement, people may have different ideas of what they've agreed to. This adjective adds the "not" prefix <i>in-</i> to <i>explicit</i>, from the Latin <i>explicitus</i>, "unobstructed," and its root <i>explicare</i>, "unfold, unravel, or explain."</p></div>`;
