Your pet poodle isn't <i>wild</i>, but the groundhog that lives under your garden shed is <i>wild</i>.</p><p class="long">An animal or plant in its native habitat is wild, like a wild dingo or a wild strawberry. An untamed bit of nature, like your overgrown back yard, or a stormy ocean, is also wild. If a person is wild, he might be unrestrained, crazy, or even enthusiastic â€” like someone who's wild about cabaret music. The term "to run <i>wild</i>" means to grow unrestrained, undisciplined, like a wild animal or an imagination that isn't held back by rules.</p></div>`;
