Lawnmowers and motorcycles can have one piston or as many as 12. Most cars have four, six, or eight pistons. The exact way pistons work depends on the specific type of engine, but they're always essential. The word itself comes from the piston's repetitive movement â€” it shares a root meaning of "to pound" with <i>pestle</i>, the tool used for pounding and grinding spices.</p></div></div>`;
