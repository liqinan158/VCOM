var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">arrhythmic</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">Someone who can’t keep a beat is probably a bad dancer.  They’re also <i>arrhythmic</i>, which is an adjective that means having no rhythm at all.</p><p class="long">Most people have a steady heartbeat, ticking one pulse after another like a clock. But if you have an arrhythmic heartbeat, better call a doctor!. An arrhythmic heart beats randomly, without any regular pattern. The word can be tough to spell, so one trick is to start with the word <i>rhythm</i>, then add the prefix <i>ar</i>- (meaning “without”) and the suffix -<i>ic</i> (“characterized by”). Spell it that way, and you’ve got the definition memorized too: "characterized by being without rhythm."</p></div>`;
