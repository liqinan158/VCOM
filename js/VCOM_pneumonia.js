If you catch <i>pneumonia</i>, you may end up in the hospital.</p><p class="long">You've probably had people warn you not to go out in the rain without an umbrella or out in the cold without a hat or scarf because you’ll catch pneumonia. While they have your best interests in mind, you don’t actually get pneumonia from being cold or wet. Pneumonia is caused by viruses or bacteria. It’s a pretty common disease, but unfortunately it can be very serious in some cases, particularly in young children and elderly people.</p></div></div>`;
