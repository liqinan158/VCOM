It's the kind of "slop" prisoners and other inmates of institutions were historically forced to eat.</p><p class="long">Gruel was made most famous by Dickens's Oliver Twist, the little orphan boy in the workhouse, who was so hungry he even asked for seconds of it: "Please sir, I want some more." Gruel's reputation, not great to begin with, never recovered. From this delightful substance comes the adjective <i>grueling,</i> describing an experience that's exhausting and punishing. "To get one's <i>gruel</i>" was 1700s slang meaning "to receive one's punishment." Even back then gruel had a bad rap.</p></div></div>`;
