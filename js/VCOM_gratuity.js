You might leave a <i>gratuity</i> of several dollars when you eat lunch in a restaurant or when you get your hair cut.</p><p class="long">A <i>gratuity</i> is usually a relatively small amount of money, a percentage of the total cost of a purchase or service.  A gratuity doesn't pay for the goods purchased â€” it's a separate reward to the person who did the work. For example, in the United States, waiters and waitresses typically expect a gratuity of between 18 and 20 percent of the total cost of a meal.</p></div></div>`;
