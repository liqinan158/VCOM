If you <i>mistrust</i> bus drivers, you may decide to walk instead.</p><p class="long">Are you suspicious of clowns in general? Then you mistrust them. This verb has a very similar meaning to <i>distrust</i> â€” as nouns, both words mean "a lack of trust." A subtle difference between the two is that distrust tends to be based on a bad experience (if a clown once pinched you, you will probably always distrust that clown). Mistrust, on the other hand, is a more general sense of suspicion.</p></div>`;
