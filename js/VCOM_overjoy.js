If you adopt that fuzzy kitten and give it to your little sister, it will absolutely <i>overjoy</i> her.</p><p class="long">Your teacher has the power to overjoy your whole class â€” all he has to do is cancel the math quiz and order pizza instead. And you can just as easily overjoy your grandparents by arranging a surprise reunion with all of your cousins. The adjective <i>overjoyed</i> (or "deliriously happy") is more common than the verb <i>overjoy</i>, but they're both great words for describing a thrilling, glorious happiness.</p></div>`;
