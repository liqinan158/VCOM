If you are sure you want apple pie, you could say you <i>definitely</i> want it. The base word <i>definite</i> can also mean "a certain limit," like the definite size a shelf must have to be. You wouldn't say "the carpenter definitely cuts the wood," to describe the exactness of the work; use <i>precisely</i> instead. AND, yes, <i>definitely</i> definitely has an <i>e</i> before the <i>ly</i>!</p></div></div>`;
