When you see embers, the fire isn’t finished yet, but it’s almost done. If you’re camping and you put out a fire, don’t leave it alone until the embers go out, too. People also use <i>embers</i> as a metaphor for other things that are starting to fade, like the last embers of a dying friendship.</p></div>`;
