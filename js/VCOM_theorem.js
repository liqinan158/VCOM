In mathematics, if you plug in the numbers, you can show a <i>theorem</i> is true.</p><p class="long">Just as a theory is an idea that can be supported or disproved, a theorem is also an idea, but it's one that has been proven and can be demonstrated again and again if used properly. In math class, you might have learned some theorems. One example is the Pythagorean theorem, which can be represented as A squared plus B squared equals C squared. Although itâ€™s usually used in math, theorems can be laws, rules, formulas, or even logical deductions.</p></div>`;
