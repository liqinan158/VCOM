In a very general sense it relates to pushing, or a push in a direction; <i>drive</i> and <i>go</i> go hand in hand. You could drive across country, drive cattle on a cattle drive, drive a golf ball by hitting it off a tee, drive prey into the open, clean your computerâ€™s hard drive, or drive someone crazy. But do you really have the drive to do all that?</p></div>`;
