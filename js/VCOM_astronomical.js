Everything in that sky, including the stars and planets, is also astronomical because it is part of a science called <i>astronomy</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Astra</i> and <i>aster</i> are the Latin and Greek words for <i>star</i>, and the first four letters of <i>astronomical</i>, <i>a-s-t-r</i>, are a scramble of the word <i>star</i>. Astronomy includes the study of stars, but planets and other objects and happenings in space are also part of astronomical studies. Considering how large everything in space is, it makes sense that very, very large or uncountable things sometimes get the description <i>astronomical</i>.</p></div></div>`;
