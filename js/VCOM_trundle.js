As a noun, <i>trundle</i> means "a roller," and it usually refers to something on wheels that can be moved around, like a trundle bed, a low bed frame you can slide and store beneath a taller bed. You might roll out the trundle bed when your friend sleeps over, and then try to fall asleep as you listen to your brother trundle around the kitchen looking for a midnight snack.</p></div>`;
