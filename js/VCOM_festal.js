Anything that's <i>festal</i> has a jubilant, celebratory quality.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>festal</i> is a little old-fashioned; these days, you're more likely to use <i>festive</i> instead. The two words are closely related to <i>festival</i>, which was originally defined as "a festal day." All three words share a Latin root, <i>festum</i>, or "feast" â€” and everyone knows that a feast is at the heart of every truly festal celebration.</p></div></div>`;
