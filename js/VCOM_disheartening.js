It's <i>disheartening</i> when your basketball team loses four games in a row.</p><p class="long">Breaking <i>disheartening</i> down to its parts, you can see the <i>dis-</i> prefix, meaning "not" or "take away," and the figurative <i>heart</i>, "good feelings or courage." While a heartening message from your pen pal cheers you up, anything disheartening does the opposite. A disheartening grade on your big English paper brings you down, and disheartening news can make your whole family feel a little depressed. If it's disheartening, it's a bummer.</p></div></div>`;
