When you learn about a tragedy, like a tsunami that kills many people, it makes you feel terrible for the <i>doomed</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Doomed</i> is a plural noun for referring to a group of unfortunate people, and it's also an adjective describing someone who's destined to die. A runaway dog that kills the animal control officer's pet chickens is doomed, and many characters in Shakespeare's tragic plays are doomed. You can also follow <i>doomed</i> with "to" to mean "destined" or "fated." Your uncle might be doomed to continue working as a school bus driver for the rest of his career.</p></div>`;
