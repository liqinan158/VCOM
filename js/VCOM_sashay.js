Fashion models sometimes <i>sashay</i> down the runway.</p><p class="long">When you sashay, you're showing off — but in a deliberately casual way. Kids playing dress up might sashay, and the most popular middle school students might sashay into class on the first day. You can also use <i>sashay</i> to describe a dance step, both a sideways square dance move and a ballet step; it's a mispronunciation of the French ballet term <i>chassé</i>, "gliding step," or literally, "to chase," since one foot "chases" the other.</p></div>`;
