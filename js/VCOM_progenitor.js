The clue comes in the "gen" part, meaning "birth, procreation," and signifying the genetic contribution of an ancestor to a family line. <i>Prō-</i> means "forward," and the <i>-tor</i> suffix indicates someone doing an action — so a progenitor is someone who gives rise to a family line.</p></div></div>`;
