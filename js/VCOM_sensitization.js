It might be the result of <i>sensitization</i>, the process of making someone react to something that previously had no effect.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>sensitization</i> is formed from the verb <i>sensitize</i>, which in turn comes from the adjective <i>sensitive</i>, meaning "capable of sensation." In psychology talk, a person might develop a <i>sensitization</i> from an emotional situation. For example, a child who is verbally bullied on a regular basis might, through constant fear of attack, develop a <i>sensitization</i> toward other children and become more withdrawn.</p></div></div>`;
