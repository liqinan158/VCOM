When you see it, think of a shower of good things coming down on you as you never use <i>lavish</i> with something bad. Didn't your parents lavish you with praise and love when you were small? With <i>lavish</i> as an adjective, you can rephrase that question like this: Didn't your parents offer you lavish praise and love when you were little?</p></div></div>`;
