So you probably don't want to engage in any kind of <i>debauchery</i> the night before an exam.</p><p class="long"><i>Debauchery</i> is all about indulging in some of life's pleasures — overindulging, in fact. It stems from the Middle French word <i>debaucher</i>, which means to “entice from work or duty.” So imagine workers being tempted from another day at the office by the promise of a wild bender in Vegas. Or college kids putting down the books and heeding the siren call of the frat party downstairs.</p></div>`;
