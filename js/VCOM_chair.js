When you invite a large group for dinner, you have to make sure you find <i>chairs</i> for all of your guests.</p><p class="long">As opposed to a bench, couch, or sofa, a chair usually seats one single person. You might have wooden kitchen chairs and a comfortable, upholstered chair with arms for watching TV. Another kind of <i>chair</i> is the leader of an organization or group, and it's also a verb meaning to lead such a group: "I've been asked to <i>chair</i> the monthly meetings of the stamp collectors' club." The Old French root is <i>chaiere</i>, "seat or throne."</p></div>`;
