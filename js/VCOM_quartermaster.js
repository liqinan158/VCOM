Sometimes the <i>quartermaster</i> is an individual, and other times it's a whole military unit.</p><p class="long">The quartermaster has an important job. While historically an army's quartermaster distributed uniforms and other clothing, today this officer might also procure food and other supplies. In the US Navy, a quartermaster obtains and takes care of nautical charts, and in the Boy Scouts, the quartermaster maintains camping supplies. The word has been in use since the fifteenth century, from the French <i>quartier-maître</i>, and it originally meant an officer on a ship who stowed goods in the ship's hold.</p></div>`;
