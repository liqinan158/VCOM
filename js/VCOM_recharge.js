In addition to your camera battery and laptop, sometimes you need to recharge yourself, or take a break so you can become energized again. Less commonly, <i>recharge</i> is used to mean "refill a glass," and the original meaning, in the fifteenth century, was "to reload a vessel."</p></div></div>`;
