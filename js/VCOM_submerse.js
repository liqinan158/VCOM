When you watch a seabird <i>submerse</i>, you see it dive completely under water, probably so that it can catch a fish.</p><p class="long">You can use the verb <i>submerse</i> in much the same way you'd use <i>submerge</i>, to mean "sink or dive under the surface of the water." The meaning of <i>submerse</i> makes sense when you know that a submersible is a small underwater vessel, similar to a submarine. All of these words have the Latin prefix <i>sub-</i> in common, which means "under." <i>Merse</i> comes from the Latin verb "to plunge," <i>mergere </i>.</p></div>`;
