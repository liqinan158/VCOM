A bully might constantly <i>deride</i> other kids in his class — which might lead to many afternoons spent in the principal's office.</p><p class="long">To "ride" people is to get on their case or give them a hard time, and to <i>deride</i> is to do the same with insulting language or poor treatment. <i>Deride</i> comes from the Latin root <i>dērīdēre,</i> meaning "to ridicule, to scorn," and it's often used to express dislike or even hatred. Criticizing something with words is a common way to deride, and politicians often deride each other in their speeches during election campaigns.</p></div></div>`;
