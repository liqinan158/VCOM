You can also say <i>abuse</i> or <i>mistreat.</i> If a big company maltreats its workers, they may rebel by going on strike or joining a lawsuit. This verb combines the prefix <i>mal-</i>, "badly, poorly, or wrong," and the word <i>treat</i>, from the Latin root <i>tractare</i>, "manage or handle."</p></div>`;
