If you get a bad ear infection, you'll need a <i>prescription</i> for antibiotics.</p><p class="long">When your doctor writes a prescription, she's advising you to take a medication that you can only get from a pharmacist. You can refer to the paper with the drug's name and the doctor's signature and the bottle of medicine as a prescription. Sometimes <i>prescription</i> is used in a non-medical way to simply mean a suggestion or recommendation, like laughter and friends â€” a great prescription for chasing away the blues.</p></div>`;
