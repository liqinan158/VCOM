You may believe it's defensible to wage war in some circumstances, while your pacifist friend thinks it's never okay to kill for any reason. <i>Defensible</i> comes from an Old French root, <i>defendre</i>, "defend or resist," from the Latin root <i>defendere</i>, "guard or protect."</p></div></div>`;
