If you insert Latin words and phrases into your everyday speech, you can call it <i>macaronic</i>.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>macaronic</i> most often describes a satirical writing style that adds Latin endings to everyday language, or uses puns made from a combination of two languages. The word's root is the dialectal Italian <i>maccarone</i>, "pasty food," or "dumpling," thought of as "peasant food," reflecting its sometimes derogatory intent. Macaronic writing is often funny, showing up in humorous poems, novels, and films. In speech, this style is sometimes called "code-switching."</p></div>`;
