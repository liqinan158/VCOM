A moping person is usually frowning, slouched over, quiet, and maybe even lying down. We mope when we're sad, but part of <i>moping</i> is directed at other people, because moping is at least a little public. When someone says you're "<i>moping</i> around," they can tell you're trying to let everyone know how sad you are. To <i>mope</i> is to say "Hey! Somebody cheer me up!"</p></div></div>`;
