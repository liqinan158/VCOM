It comes from the meaningless song refrain <i>fol-de-rol</i>, a variation on "tra la la," and first appeared in the 18th century. Later, it came to have the additional meaning "cheap, showy trifle or gewgaw." Some people decide to elope when they get married, instead of having an elaborate wedding full of <i>folderol</i>.</p></div></div>`;
