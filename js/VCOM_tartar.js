If you become a dentist one day, part of your job will be scraping <i>tartar</i> off people's teeth.</p><p class="long">Tartar is a very hard substance, too hard to be brushed off with a toothbrush. It's formed when certain elements in saliva mix with the plaque that commonly occurs on teeth. Another kind of <i>tartar</i> is known as "cream of <i>tartar</i>," and it's a common ingredient in baking, either alone or as an ingredient in baking powder. The Greek root refers to this baking tartar, <i>tartaron</i>, "substance encrusting the sides of wine casks."</p></div>`;
