To sound out an unfamiliar word, you break it into its <i>phonetic</i> parts, saying each in the order in which it appears.</p><p class="long">When you use the word <i>phonetic</i>, you're talking about pronunciation, or the way language sounds. When you learn how to speak Chinese, for example, you're often taught both traditional Chinese characters and a phonetic alphabet, which helps people learn to correctly pronounce Chinese words. The Greek word for <i>sound</i> or <i>voice</i> is <i>phone</i>, and it's the root of <i>phonetic</i>, which was first used in the early 1800s.</p></div>`;
