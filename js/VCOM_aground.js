If your kayak goes <i>aground</i>, you may need to get out and push it further out in the bay.</p><p class="long">When you use the word <i>aground</i>, you're almost certainly talking about a boat or ship. If a sailboat runs aground, its hull can be damaged, which might even cause the boat to take on water. Running aground can be a minor inconvenience, or a major accident. Since about 1500, the adjective <i>aground</i> has been a nautical term that generally means "stranded on land."</p></div></div>`;
