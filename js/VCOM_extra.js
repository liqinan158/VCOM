Other times, they're not so great: nobody needs extra problems or extra traffic. <i>Extra</i> can also be an adverb, meaning "especially" or "unusually," like when your dog behaves extra well or you plan an extra special party for your friend. <i>Extra</i> comes from <i>extraordinary</i>, from the Latin root <i>extra ordinem</i>, "outside normal events."</p></div>`;
