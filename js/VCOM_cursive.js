It's also known as script or longhand. When the third-grade students learned <i>cursive</i> writing, they were excited to find that they could write entire words without lifting their pencil from the paper.</p><p class="long"><i>Cursive</i> comes from the past participle of the Latin word <i>currere</i>, which means "to run." In cursive handwriting, the letters all run into one another and the hand runs across the page, never lifting between letters. Every time a document asks for your signature at the bottom of a document, you are meant to use this flowing cursive writing style.</p></div>`;
