If you put so much pepper in your soup that you can't taste the other spices, then you caused an <i>imbalance</i> in your flavoring.</p><p class="long">It’s easy to remember the meaning of <i>imbalance</i> when you break the word into parts. You might recognize the prefix <i>im-</i> as a way to say “not.” Combine that with the familiar word <i>balance</i>, and you come up with something that is decidedly out of whack, or not balanced. It means that something is out of proportion, such as a trade <i>imbalance</i> between nations, meaning the amount of goods they sell to one another is not equal.</p></div>`;
