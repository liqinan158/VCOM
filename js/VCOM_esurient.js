It would be dangerous to leave your <i>esurient</i> brother in charge of the three dozen cupcakes you baked for a birthday party.</p><p class="long"><i>Esurient</i> describes someone who's famished or capable of eating an unbelievable amount of food. That's why an esurient group of high school kids might consume an alarming number of pizzas, and a people-eating monster with an esurient glimmer in its eye would make you run the other way. The word implies a greediness that goes beyond mere hunger, and it comes from the Latin root word <i>edere</i>, "to eat."</p></div></div>`;
