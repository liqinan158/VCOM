Football, checkers, Monopoly, volleyball, Ms. Pacman â€”  they're all fun <i>games</i> to play.</p><p class="long">Some games are simple, like Connect Four or Tic Tac Toe. Others are played for millions of dollars, like professional basketball. Games usually have winners and losers, and people play them because they're fun. Other meanings of this word have less to do with playing: If you're a salesperson, you could say you're in the sales game. Wild animals that you hunt and eat are called game. And being game can mean you have disabled feet or legs.</p></div></div>`;
