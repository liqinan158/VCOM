That's why we say when someone goes on a diet, it's because they want to <i>reduce</i>; it's a polite way of suggesting they need to drop pounds and become a smaller size.</p><p class="long">The word <i>reduce</i> first appeared in Old French during the 14th Century, when it meant "bring back." From the Latin <i>re</i>, which meant "back," coupled with <i>ducere</i>, meaning "bring or lead" â€” we ended up with <i>reduce</i>. The current meaning, "to lessen," appeared in the late 1700's, drawn from the word's military use, "reduce to ranks," which meant break into smaller units.  Cooks use the word <i>reduce</i> when they reduce a liquid, boiling it down until it has less volume and is thicker.</p></div></div>`;
