It's the infection that can develop around a wound that kills the tissue, turning it into a terrible stinking sore.</p><p class="long">In the days before antibiotics even the smallest scratch could lead to gangrene, and doctors would often cut off a finger or even a limb and then seal it with a red hot poker rather than risk the infection spreading. Special surgeons known as <i>sawbones</i> were famed for the speed they could amputate a limb to avoid gangrene setting in. Enough to stop you ever being nostalgic about the good old days.</p></div>`;
