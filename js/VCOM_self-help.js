Stuart Smalley is a fictional <i>self-help</i> guru whose advice is to say this daily affirmation: “I’m good enough, I’m strong enough, and doggone it, people like me!”</p><p class="long">You can use the term <i>self-help</i> for any improvement you help yourself make, but it's often used for the industry and culture of self improvement programs. You can buy self-help books or attend self-help groups, some of which can provide emotional support and great ideas for helping yourself. You might start a self-help practice to become a better listener, or to try and eat less refined sugar, or to understand why you feel blue in the wintertime.</p></div>`;
