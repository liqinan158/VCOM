A typical barge can hold more than a thousand tons of cargo, so it's ideal for bulky, weighty goods. <i>Barge</i> is also a verb, meaning both "move by barge" and "shove forward," as when you barge in the door of a crowded party or barge into your brother's room just to bother him. The root is believed to be the Greek <i>baris</i>, "Egyptian boat."</p></div></div>`;
