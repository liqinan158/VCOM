There are 1,760 yards in a <i>mile</i>, which is the same as 5,280 feet or 63,360 inches. If you're exhausted in the morning, your <i>mile</i>-long walk to school might feel much longer.</p><p class="long">In the U.S. and the U.K., the mile is the standard unit for measuring roads and highways, while most other countries use the kilometer instead. You might hear people talk about how many miles per gallon their cars can go, or how many miles per hour they're allowed to drive. Informally, the word <i>miles</i> also means "a long way," or "a lot," so you might describe a crowd stretching for miles. The Latin root, <i>milia</i>, means "thousands."</p></div>`;
