var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">normalcy</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">In the early twentieth century,  President Warren Harding popularized the word <i>normalcy</i> with his slogan: â€œreturn to normalcy," about getting back to normal life after the war. Since then, the word has been used often instead of "normality."</p><p class="long"><i>Normalcy</i>, pronounced "NOR-mal-see," is a state of being normal, usual, or expected. When something returns to a state of normalcy, it is returning to the way that it ought to be.  It is another word for <i>normality</i>. Some people believe that normalcy should not be used because the word <i>normality</i> is more formally correct, but in the U.S., you'll often see <i>normalcy</i> used. When it comes to choosing one, take your pick.</p></div>`;
