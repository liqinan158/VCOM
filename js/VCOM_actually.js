You might say, "It's hard to know which of these cookies will taste best without <i>actually</i> sampling them all." The other way to use the word <i>actually</i> is to imply that your expectations have been proven wrong, that the opposite of what you thought is true. You could say, "The hotel room looked spotless, but <i>actually</i> it turned out to have bedbugs."</p></div></div>`;
