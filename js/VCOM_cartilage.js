Your outer ear is made of <i>cartilage</i>, which is why you can pull on and bend it.</p><p class="long">Whenever you run or jump, thank your cartilage. It's the strong but stretchy tissue that supports your joints so you don't just fall to the ground in a heap. Cartilage also gives your nose its shape. And when you have a cold, you can blow that nose forcefully without hurting it because your cartilage also supports your honker.</p></div>`;
