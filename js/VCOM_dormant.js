They may have the ability to come to life, but they remain dormant, or inactive. <i>Dormant</i> comes from French <i>dormir,</i> "to sleep," and it refers to living things that are on a break rather than things that have died. Being dormant is being temporarily at rest, although sometimes, as with some cancer cells, things become permanently — and thankfully — dormant.</p></div></div>`;
