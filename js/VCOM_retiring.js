You can often be found in the library and other quiet places, and if someone compliments you, you're likely to blush and change the subject.</p><p class="long">If you call someone <i>retiring</i>, it isn't necessarily clear whether you mean it as a compliment or something closer to a put-down. Usually, the word is used to describe someone who is shy or modest to a fault. But it can also be used to suggest that someone isn't arrogant, which is usually a good thing. And, of course, <i>retiring</i> can also refer to someone who stepped down from their last job and doesn't intend to work anymore.</p></div>`;
