If you spread false rumors that there's chicken stock in the vegetarian entree at Joe's Diner, you would <i>sully</i> Joe's good reputation.</p><p class="long"><i>Sully</i> can also mean to tarnish or make spotty. It's easy to remember this meaning when you know that <i>sully</i> comes from the Middle French word <i>souiller</i>, meaning, "make dirty." For example, dripping chocolate sauce onto the table will sully your mother's new white tablecloth. Another meaning of <i>sully</i> is to corrupt or cast suspicion on. If an automaker recalls millions of vehicles due to safety problems, it doesn't exactly inspire confidence â€” in fact, it may sully their brand.</p></div></div>`;
