"Go <i>fetch</i>!" you might shout after your dog while throwing a stick into the yard.</p><p class="long"><i>Fetch</i> comes from the Old English <i>fatian</i> meaning "grasp." When a dog fetches a bone, it grasps it in its mouth.  You can ask your sister to fetch or grab your backpack off the table. If you sell something for a good price, you can fetch, or bring in, a decent amount of money. If you are sick of playing fetch, you might try to fetch a good price for your pooch.</p></div></div>`;
