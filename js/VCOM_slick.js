How did that Girl Scout talk you into buying so many boxes of cookies? It must have been her <i>slick</i> sales pitch.</p><p class="long">A great salesman is often described as slick â€” he or she seems more like a friend than someone trying to sell you something. Things that are smooth and glossy can also be called slick, like the surface of a glass table or an icy patch on the sidewalk. <i>Slick</i> is also a verb, meaning "to smooth," like when you slick back your hair. The oldest meaning of <i>slick</i> is shiny, and in the 1620s, it was even the name of a kind of cosmetic.</p></div></div>`;
