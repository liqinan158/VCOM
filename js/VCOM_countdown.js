When you're preparing to launch your model rocket, you can make it more exciting with a <i>countdown</i>!</p><p class="long">"Five, four, three, two, one, blast off!" is a countdown that may sound familiar if you've ever watched footage of a NASA space shuttle launch. You might also hear a countdown on New Year's Eve, as revelers count down the seconds until midnight and the beginning of a new year. This word comes from American English, first appearing in the 1950s in the context of rocket launches.</p></div></div>`;
