It's polite to speak in a <i>low-pitched</i> voice before your houseguests have woken up in the morning.</p><p class="long">People who sing in low registers — altos and basses, for example — have low-pitched voices, and a big dog might have a low-pitched bark, especially compared to your toy poodle's yap. This definition of <i>low-pitched</i> comes from the sense of <i>pitch</i> that means "the highness or lowness of a sound's tone." Another way to use this adjective is to mean "at a low slant or slight slope," from the <i>pitch</i> meaning "steepness of slope."</p></div></div>`;
