When you add steamed milk to <i>espresso</i>, you get a latte or a cappuccino.</p><p class="long">Espresso is different from regular American coffee in many ways. It's typically made using dark roasted coffee beans that are very finely ground and brewed in a special espresso machine that forces hot water at high pressure through the ground coffee. The resulting espresso is dark, ideally with a layer of creamy-colored "crema" on the top. In Italian, <i>espresso</i> means "pressed out," from the Latin <i>exprimere</i>, "squeeze out."</p></div>`;
