We might say that Jolly Old Saint Nicholas — Santa Claus — is the king of jollity. But you can join his court — you are the picture of jollity when you are laughing uncontrollably with good friends or whooping it up at a Country Western dance. We are talking mirth and merriment: that's jollity.</p></div>`;
