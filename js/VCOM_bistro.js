The word comes from Paris, of course, but there are <i>bistros</i> all over the world.</p><p class="long">Bistros started in the boarding houses of Paris, where landlords would serve food to the public in order to make some extra money. The history of the word itself is slippery, but it might be related to the French word <i>bistouille</i>, slang for “bad alcohol.” Or maybe the Russians brought it when they wanted food <i>bystra</i>, or fast. Who knows? We do know that a bistro is a small restaurant that grown-ups like. There’s no room for crayons.</p></div></div>`;
