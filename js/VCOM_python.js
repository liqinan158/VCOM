Instead of injecting poison through their fangs, <i>pythons</i> kill by wrapping around and asphyxiating their prey. You certainly wouldn't want to be a <i>python</i>'s main squeeze.</p><p class="long">A python will grab smaller animals with its sharp teeth and then use its powerful coils to constrict the prey until it stops breathing. Pythons can also eat animals larger than they are â€” occasionally, pythons have been known to eat antelope and deer. The word <i>python</i> comes from Greek mythology, in which Python was a dragon or serpent who guarded the Delphic oracle until he was eventually killed by Apollo.</p></div>`;
