Professional athletes are often benched suffering from <i>contusions.</i> After all, if they're being paid millions, it sounds kinda wimpy to pull them because they're suffering from a...bruise.</p><p class="long">A <i>contusion</i> is any damage to the body that doesn't break the skin but ruptures the blood capillaries beneath, resulting in a handsome-looking discoloration. For once, it's a medical term not used widely to describe a broader emotional or psychological state. You could talk about an "emotional <i>contusion,</i>" but please, better not to. There are better terms around (see <i>heartbroken,</i> <i>wounded,</i> <i>forlorn,</i> etc.). Your audience will thank you.</p></div></div>`;
