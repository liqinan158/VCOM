You can use it to mean the adaptation of some other kind of writing into verse, or to talk about the form — meter, rhythm, or language — of a poem. It comes from the Latin word <i>versificationem</i>, and it's closely related to <i>versify</i>, whose root is <i>versificare</i>, "compare verse or turn into verse."</p></div>`;
