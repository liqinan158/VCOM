When your cousin travels from North Dakota to visit you in Chicago, she might take one look at you and declare you totally <i>citified</i>.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>citified</i> is often used as a put-down, a way to criticize someone for being too much a city person. If your expertise includes hailing cabs and dodging pedestrians on the sidewalk, your attempts to master cattle ranching or piloting a lobster boat might inspire the locals to call you citified. A more complimentary word to use would be <i>urbane</i>, which describes someone who's an elegant and refined city person.</p></div>`;
