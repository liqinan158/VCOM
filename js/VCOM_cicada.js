You might hear hundreds of male <i>cicadas</i> singing loudly on a summer night.</p><p class="long">Cicadas are often confused with locusts, which are a similar size, a little under two inches long, but are unrelated to the cicada. Cicadas live from two to five years, and in many parts of the world they're a popular food â€” they were also eaten in ancient Greece and their shells are an ingredient in several traditional Chinese medicines. The word <i>cicada</i> is Latin, meaning "tree cricket." In some parts of Appalachia, cicadas are called "jarflies."</p></div></div>`;
