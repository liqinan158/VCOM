Your <i>madcap</i> adventure might include a spur-of-the-moment bus ride to a nearby city without enough money in your pocket to buy lunch.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>madcap</i>, which can simply mean "impetuous," can also have a sense of "funny and eccentric." A movie that's described as a madcap comedy will probably be full of broad slapstick and laugh-out-loud physical humor. <i>Madcap</i>, dating from the 16th century, originally meant "lunatic" or "crazy person," from the "head" sense of <i>cap</i> â€” in other words, a madcap was a "crazy head."</p></div></div>`;
