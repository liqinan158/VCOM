For example, if you can't find your glasses, you might say, "I've looked <i>everywhere</i> for them!" You haven't actually looked everywhere, in every possible place — you've actually only looked in all the places you think you might have left your glasses. In Old English, it's <i>æfre gehwær</i>.</p></div>`;
