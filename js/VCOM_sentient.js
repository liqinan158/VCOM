Explain that to a pet rock.</p><p class="long"><i>Sentient</i> comes from the Latin <i>sentient-,</i> "feeling," and it describes things that are alive, able to feel and perceive, and show awareness or responsiveness. Having senses makes something sentient, or able to smell, communicate, touch, see, or hear. Whether or not plants and living things other than animals and people are sentient depends on whom you ask.</p></div>`;
