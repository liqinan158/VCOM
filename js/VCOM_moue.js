If you make this expression, you're usually showing distaste, petulance, or a similar emotion. <i>Moue</i> is also used, however, to refer to a flirtatious pout.</p><p class="long">The word <i>moue</i> is pronounced "moo," like the sound a cow makes, although the origin of the word has nothing to do with cows. Instead, the noun <i>moue</i> comes from the Middle Dutch word <i>mouwe</i>, which meant a protruding lip. You can make a moue of displeasure when someone steals your parking spot or give a coy moue when you're trying to get away with something. Either way, you're pouting.</p></div></div>`;
