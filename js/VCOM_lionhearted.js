A fearless woman who jumps into a writhing pit of snakes to save a small dog could be called <i>lionhearted</i> (or "nuts").</p><p class="long">Anyone who displays the courage of a lion is lionhearted, from firefighters willing to risk their lives to save other people to a shy child who walks bravely into a new school on her own, determined to make friends. The adjective <i>lionhearted</i> shows up in many works of literature, and history as well â€” the most famous person described this way was King Richard I of England, called Richard the Lionheart because of his bravery in war.</p></div></div>`;
