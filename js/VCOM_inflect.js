After hearing tragic news, you'll <i>inflect</i> what you say with the sadness you feel.</p><p class="long">The changing pitch of your voice inflects your words with meaning, and another way to inflect is to change the form of a word for grammatical reasons, including tense, number, or gender. When you inflect verbs, it's also called <i>conjugation</i>. For example, when you change the verb "to be" from "I am" to "we are," you inflect it. The Latin root of <i>inflect</i> is <i>inflectere</i>, "to bend," and also "to change."</p></div></div>`;
