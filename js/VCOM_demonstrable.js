They just do. The verb <i>demonstrate</i> means to show or instruct. The adjective shortens the root to become <i>demonstrable</i>. The steps for buckling a seatbelt must be easily demonstrable, or people will go flying all over the cabin. <i>Demonstrable</i> is often used to refer to the truth of something: if something isn't demonstrable, then we can't really say that it exists, can we?</p></div>`;
