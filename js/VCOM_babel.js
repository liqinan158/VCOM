It might be hard for your grandfather to hear in a restaurant with background music and a loud <i>babel</i> of conversation.</p><p class="long">The babel of voices in a hotel's hall at night makes it difficult to sleep, and the babel of kids talking all at once is frustrating for a new teacher. <i>Babel</i> can also mean a figurative noise or conversation: "The <i>babel</i> of expert opinions on this issue is confusing me." <i>Babel</i> comes from the Biblical "Tower of <i>Babel</i>" story, in which God confused the builders of a tower to heaven by making them speak different languages.</p></div></div>`;
