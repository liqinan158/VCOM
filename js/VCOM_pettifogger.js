If your neighbor hires an unscrupulous quack to sue you, you might call his attorney a <i>pettifogger</i>.</p><p class="long">You don't hear the word <i>pettifogger</i> much these days, since the word is fairly archaic, but you might come across it in an old book. A bad lawyer, or pettifogger, used dubious means to get clients and to win cases. The mid-16th century word itself combined <i>petty</i> — "small," from the French <i>petit</i> — with the obsolete word <i>fogger</i>, "underhanded dealer," which probably came from a wealthy 15th century Bavarian family of merchants, the <i>Fuggers</i>.</p></div></div>`;
