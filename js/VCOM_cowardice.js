If you run away screaming when your Uncle Marvin shows up to the Halloween party in a clown mask, you will betray your <i>cowardice</i> â€” particularly if you're not a child.</p><p class="long">The opposite of <i>courageousness</i> is <i>cowardice</i>. For example, not standing up for someone who's being bullied shows cowardice. The origin of the words <i>coward</i> and <i>cowardice</i> has been traced to the Latin word for "tail," <i>coda</i>, showing a connection with a popular phrase that describes cowardice: "walking away with their tails between their legs."</p></div>`;
