It's what's left after you remove all the affixes — the prefixes like "un-" or "anti-" and suffixes such as "-able" and "-tion." With a word like "lovely," when you take away the suffix "-ly," you're left with the root word "love." Other words, like "schoolhouse" and "armchair," are made up of two root words together.</p></div></div>`;
