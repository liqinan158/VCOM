Criminals or outlaws often lie low in a <i>hideout</i> to avoid being found by the police.</p><p class="long">A car thief might use his grandmother's apartment as a hideout to avoid detection. A group of ten year-olds might also have a hideout, a place that's protected from parents, bullies, older siblings, and anyone else who might interfere. Before the first use of <i>hideout</i>, in the 1880s, came the verb phrase <i>hide out</i>, or "hide from authorities," which was coined during the Civil War in reference to draft dodgers.</p></div></div>`;
