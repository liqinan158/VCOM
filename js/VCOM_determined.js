At that level, they've got to be driven to succeed. Otherwise, their opponents will surely beat them.</p><p class="long">If you want to reach your goal, you must be determined to do so. To be determined is to be motivated, driven, or really focused on the task at hand â€” and that can be something as big as winning a prize or as small as fixing a squeaky door. No matter the task, the folks who get the job done are almost always the most determined. <i>Determined</i> can also mean "decided." For instance, a judge can determine what the sentence will be. If that sentence is predetermined, then it's already been decided.</p></div></div>`;
