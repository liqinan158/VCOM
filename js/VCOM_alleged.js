The word <i>alleged</i> is often used in connection with court cases, because the accused is innocent until proven guilty: an alleged robber is a suspected robber but has not been proven guilty of robbery.  Journalists often use <i>alleged</i> in news stories when someone’s guilt is suspected but not confirmed. Sometimes <i>alleged</i> means doubtful or dubious, as in "Who is this <i>alleged</i> expert?"</p></div></div>`;
