We tend to think of people as elderly when they're quite aged and have started to become physically frail. You can also use the adjective for animals or even inanimate objects that are getting old: "That <i>elderly</i> oak tree is going to have to come down." The Old English root <i>ealdorlic</i> means "princely" or "excellent."</p></div></div>`;
