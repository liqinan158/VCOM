Snakes, earthworms, and even the human appendix can be described as <i>vermiform</i>.</p><p class="long">The term <i>vermiform</i> is used by scientists to describe worms and worm-like animals â€” it comes from two Latin roots, <i>vermis</i>, "worm," and <i>forma</i>, "form or shape." So a biologist might describe vermiform leeches in a lake or an infectious disease specialist might diagnose a patient with a vermiform parasite like pinworms. Sometimes body parts with this general shape are also called vermiform, like the vermiform appendix that most humans have.</p></div></div>`;
