You'll almost always find this word in a medical context. A medicine that makes you sleepy would <i>contraindicate</i> driving, but that same medicine would be fine to take while you’re lying on the couch.</p><p class="long"><i>Contraindicate</i> has Latin roots in <i>contra</i> for “against” and <i>indicate</i> for “to point out.” To contraindicate means to “point away” because the combination of the activity with the drugs or treatment could be dangerous to the patient. For example, the diagnosis of a virus in a young child contraindicates the use of aspirin because it's been shown to increase the risk of a potentially fatal syndrome. <i>Contraindicate</i> is often used in the passive voice, “For young children, aspirin is <i>contraindicated</i>.”</p></div></div>`;
