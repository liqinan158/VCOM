At a graveside funeral, you'll see the <i>coffin</i> lowered into a grave.</p><p class="long">Most coffins are made of wood, though they can also be steel, fiberglass, or bamboo. A coffin is generally thought of as the same thing as a casket, although some people distinguish between a six-sided coffin and a four-sided casket. The earliest meaning of <i>coffin</i>, from the 14th century, was "box for valuables," from the Latin <i>cophinus</i>, "basket or hamper," and the Greek root <i>kophinos</i>, "a basket."</p></div></div>`;
