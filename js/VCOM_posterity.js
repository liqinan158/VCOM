These people of the future could be your children and great-great grandchildren, or any people who are born after you.</p><p class="long">If you save something "for posterity," you're hoping that years later people will appreciate it, like a time capsule you bury in the yard. The word comes from the Latin word for "post, after." It's also related to the word <i>posterior</i>, which means "behind, to come after in time." In legal terms, <i>posterity</i> refers to the offspring of a person and it often has to do with inheriting property and who is entitled to do so.</p></div></div>`;
