var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">manhole</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>manhole</i> is an opening in a street or sidewalk that gives workers access to underground pipes, drains, power lines, and cables. A <i>manhole</i> usually has a heavy metal cover â€” which can go shooting up in the air in the case of an underground explosion. Steer clear of smoking <i>manholes</i>!</p><p class="long">Inside a manhole, there are steps or a ladder leading down to the space underneath the street. Utility workers need access to this underground area to make repairs or updates to services. From above, a manhole simply looks like a metal circle in the pavement. The word <i>manhole</i> (which sounds a little dated, since plenty of utility workers are women) was coined in the late 18th century.</p></div>`;
