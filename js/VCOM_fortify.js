Food scientists have found ways to <i>fortify</i> cereal, but in addition to vitamins C and D, they usually add a lot of sugar.</p><p class="long">If you strengthen your defenses, you <i>fortify</i> them, perhaps by adding more arms or increasing your defensive walls. Sometimes the defenses you fortify will be tangible and sometimes the word is used metaphorically to mean give courage. If a castle was originally vulnerable to attack, the owner might fortify it by adding a moat â€” and maybe filling it with crocodiles. If you're nervous about giving a speech, you should fortify yourself with a pep talk first.</p></div></div>`;
