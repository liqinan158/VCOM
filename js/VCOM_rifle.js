var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">rifle</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>rifle</i> is a long, powerful gun that is fired from the shoulder. A soldier is most often armed with a <i>rifle</i>.</p><p class="long">Some hunters use rifles, which fire single bullets rather than the small pellets, or shot, that shotguns fire. A rifle can do more damage and is therefore often used in the military. The name comes from the shape of the barrel, which is grooved â€” or <i>rifled</i>, from the Old French word <i>rifler</i>, "to scratch or groove." Another meaning of <i>rifle</i> comes from the same root but means "to search through things in a hurried way."</p></div>`;
