A <i>lapsed</i> Baptist was raised in the Baptist church but no longer practices this religion.</p><p class="long">If you describe yourself as a lapsed Catholic or a lapsed Hindu, you once took an active part in your religion and now you don't â€” in fact, you may no longer believe. This adjective can also mean "expired," like your dog's lapsed license, which ran out months ago and you keep forgetting to renew. <i>Lapsed</i> comes from the verb <i>lapse</i>, which stems from either the Latin <i>lapsus</i>, "a slipping and falling," or <i>lapsare</i>, "to lose one's footing."</p></div></div>`;
