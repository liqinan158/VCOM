When a city <i>desegregates</i> its schools, it makes sure that all schools have racially diverse populations.</p><p class="long">The verb <i>desegregate</i> is the opposite of <i>segregate</i>, or "separate by race or religion." Both words are often used in connection with the Civil Rights Movement in the United States. In 1954, the <i>Brown v Board of Education</i> case desegregated public schools in the U.S., ruling that separate publicly funded schools for black and white students were unconstitutional.</p></div></div>`;
