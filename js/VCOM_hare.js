Remember the overconfident animal that lost a race against a tortoise in Aesop's famous fable? That was a <i>hare</i>!</p><p class="long">Hares and rabbits look very similar, but they're completely different species. Rabbits burrow, while hares stay above ground and give birth in nests in the grass. Unlike rabbits, hares are furry when they're born and able to see and move around independently. Their diets are even different â€” rabbits like grasses and vegetables, while hares dine on twigs and bark. And while you can keep a rabbit as a pet, hares haven't been domesticated.</p></div>`;
