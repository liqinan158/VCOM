var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">stupidly</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If you made a dumb mistake, you acted <i>stupidly</i>, without intelligence or common sense. You might be embarrassed if you trip in front of the whole class because you <i>stupidly</i> forgot to tie your shoes.</p><p class="long">The adverb <i>stupidly</i> is a fairly blunt and harsh way to describe anything that's done in a foolish way. Even if you think someone acted stupidly, it's more polite to keep it to yourself. Another meaning is "in a dazed way," so you might describe your dad's stunned response to his surprise party by saying, "His mouth fell open and he stood gaping stupidly for a few seconds."</p></div></div>`;
