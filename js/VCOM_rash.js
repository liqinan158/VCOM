var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">rash</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A <i>rash</i> is something that spreads like wild fire — red itchy skin or a series of unfortunate events. It can also describe an impulsive, wild decision.</p><p class="long">As an adjective, <i>rash</i> has meant "quick, vigorous" since the 1300s by way of Scotland. The meaning shifted to "reckless" a few hundred years later, and can still be used that way — a "<i>rash</i> decision" is a sudden, not well thought out one. <i>Rash</i>, the noun that no one wants on their skin, came a few hundred years after that, but from the French word <i>rache</i> which at some point meant "ringworm." Ringworm still gives us a red, itchy rash. Fun! <i>Rash</i> can also mean a lot of unpleasant things happening in a short amount of time, like robberies or earthquakes.</p></div></div>`;
