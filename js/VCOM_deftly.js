You'd be sure to impress your friends if you grabbed three grapefruits, juggled them <i>deftly</i>, and returned them to their bowl, all while carrying on a conversation.</p><p class="long">A physical or athletic act can be done deftly, or easily and well, but <i>deftly</i> can also describe something done with cleverness or wit, like a musician writing song lyrics deftly. The Old English word <i>ged√¶fte</i>, which means "mild" or "gentle," is the root of the word <i>deftly</i>, whose meaning still has that sense of doing something both skillfully and gently, or effortlessly.</p></div></div>`;
