If you want to try something more exciting than your usual hot dog, order <i>knockwurst</i> instead!</p><p class="long">Outside of North America, this sausage is known as <i>knackwurst</i>. Austrian versions of knockwurst contain bacon and potato starch, while the classic Hamburg variety is served with mustard and half a slice of white bread. The word <i>knockwurst</i> comes from the German <i> knacken</i>, "make a cracking sound," and <i>Wurst</i>, "sausage." Sausage experts claim that the "cracking sound" refers to the pop of a knockwurst's skin when you bite into it.</p></div>`;
