The word <i>rosary</i> can also refer to a set of beads for counting prayers in other religions.</p><p class="long">When it refers to the prayer, <i>Rosary</i> is usually capitalized (like the Lord's Prayer or Hail Mary). The full Rosary includes many repetitions of specific prayers, and the rosary beads are used to count them. As well as being spiritually significant, rosaries are beautiful, with beads made of wood, silver, gold, or semi-precious stones. <i>Rosary</i> comes from <i>rosaire</i>, "rose garden" in Middle French â€” think of the rosary as a "garden of prayers."</p></div></div>`;
