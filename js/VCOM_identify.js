Only one consonant separates the two words in spelling ("f" vs. "t"), and they are close relatives in meaning as well. You can easily remember the meaning of <i>identify</i>, a verb, when you recognize that it’s just a way to express the act of establishing identity — in other words, saying who or what something is.</p></div></div>`;
