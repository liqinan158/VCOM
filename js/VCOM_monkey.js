Monkeys are famously playful and mischievous, and because of this, <i>monkey</i> is a common diminutive (or fond nickname) for impish kids, and "<i>monkey</i> business" is foolishness or deceitful behavior. When you monkey around, or monkey with something, you fool about or fiddle with it.</p></div></div>`;
