The word also refers to the gist or main idea of something. If you remember the main point of a lesson, you've got the <i>substance</i>.</p><p class="long">The meaning of the noun <i>substance</i> has evolved over time, yet it has always been related to something sound and solid â€” from the Latin root <i>substare</i>, which means "to stand firm," to the Middle English definition as an "essential nature." Nowadays, we use the word to define someone who possesses honesty and intelligence, or when we examine a message to find its essence. To be thought of as a "person of <i>substance</i>" is a good thing, but to be thought of as a "<i>substance</i> abuser" is not so good.</p></div></div>`;
