You can call that its <i>perfume</i>.</p><p class="long">If you apply scented oil to your neck and wrists before leaving your house every the morning, you know what perfume is. Another kind of perfume is one that doesn't come in a bottle, like the smell of your mom's cinnamon rolls or the salty fragrance of the ocean after a storm. The earliest use of <i>perfume</i> in English specifically meant "the smell of something burning," and the Latin root is smoky as well: <i>fumare</i> means "to smoke" and <i>per</i> means "through."</p></div>`;
