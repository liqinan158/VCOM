If you're at a loud and hostile town council meeting, you might not get a chance to have your <i>say</i> unless you shout it.</p><p class="long"><i>Say</i> means to speak, so any time you utter a word, you're saying it. If you write an editorial about dogs in the paper, that's also a form of saying. Someone could quote you as saying "dogs should be worshipped." You can say something with your body language, too. Like most common words, <i>say</i> is very old, coming from the Old English <i>sÄ™cgan</i>, meaning "to tell."</p></div>`;
