If you <i>snitch</i> on your brother when he "borrows" five dollars without asking, he might call you a <i>snitch</i> — but, on the bright side, he'll probably have to pay you back.</p><p class="long">The oldest meaning of the informal <i>snitch</i> is "to betray" or, as a noun, "informer." This probably stems from 18th-century underworld slang, in which  <i>snitch</i> meant "nose" — perhaps because a snitch is really nosy. A newer definition of <i>snitch</i>, "to steal," is thought to be a variation on <i>snatch</i>, and it first appeared around the turn of the 20th century. In the Harry Potter books, a snitch is a winged, golden ball used in the game of Quidditch.</p></div>`;
