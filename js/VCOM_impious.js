When someone is being <i>impious</i> they are doing things that their church, synagogue, temple, mosque, school principal, government or parents would find unacceptable.</p><p class="long">When you don’t show reverence for religion or god, you are impious. The adjective <i>impious</i> is related to the word <i>piety</i>, which means religious reverence. To be impious is to be without piety. Being impious is similar to being blasphemous, but it’s a little more passive to be impious, while blasphemy is more actively insulting. Also, when you act out against tradition or dutifulness, you could be considered impious. If you dodge a military draft, you will likely be considered impious.</p></div></div>`;
