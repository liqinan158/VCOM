If your friends invite themselves over for dinner the night before your big test, that's an <i>imposition</i> because you'll have to cook instead of studying.</p><p class="long"><i>Imposition</i> comes from the 14th century Old French word of the same spelling, meaning "the levying of taxes, a tax, duty." Taxes are a good way to remember the meaning of <i>imposition</i>. You never want to pay taxes — but you have no choice but to pay. It can be the same for other kinds of burdens: if something is an imposition, you don't want to do it, but you likely will have to.</p></div></div>`;
