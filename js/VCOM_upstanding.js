The word is often paired with <i>citizen</i>, especially when someone's talking about a public or well-known figure: "Everyone knows the high school principal is an <i>upstanding</i> citizen." Its root is Old English, and the earliest meaning was literally "standing up." It wasn't until the 1860's that <i>upstanding</i> gained the meaning of "honest and respectable."</p></div></div>`;
