Some movies are so exaggeratedly bad that they've got a <i>campy</i> kind of charm.</p><p class="long">Anything you describe as "so bad it's good" is probably campy. Many fans of over-the-top, campy films like "Rocky Horror Picture Show," for example, find them wonderfully funny and strange. The early twentieth century slang meaning of <i>camp</i> was simply "tasteless," with <i>campy</i> emerging in the late 1950's. The root is uncertain, but it may be the French <i>se camper</i>, "to put oneself in a bold, provocative pose."</p></div>`;
