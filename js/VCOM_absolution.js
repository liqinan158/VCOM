The word is used for other kinds of forgiveness too.</p><p class="long">When you sin or make a mistake, you usually want absolution â€” which is like forgiveness. In many religions, if you confess your sins, you can be granted absolution: the sin is forgiven, forgotten, wiped clean. Usually, the sinning person has to do some kind of penance to atone for the sin to achieve absolution. Absolution is a serious concept: if you jaywalked, you probably won't worry about absolution. If you stole money from your sick grandmother, absolution is going to be more important.</p></div></div>`;
