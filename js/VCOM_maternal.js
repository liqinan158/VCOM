How you define what it is to be “like a mother” is up to you, but most people think of nurturing things like chicken soup and kisses on the forehead.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>maternal</i> comes from the Latin <i>maternus</i>, which means “of a mother.” Many traits are labeled as <i>maternal</i>, including physical traits that are genetically passed on from the mother — like being color blind. A woman’s desire to have a child is called her “<i>maternal</i>  instinct,” and if you care for other people in a nurturing way you are being maternal, even if you are not a mother. Your mother’s mother is your “<i>maternal</i> grandmother.”</p></div></div>`;
