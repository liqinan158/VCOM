We may dislike a great many things, but we are not treating them contemptuously until everyone else around us knows exactly how we feel. Acting contemptuously is putting on a little show, almost like a toddler's temper tantrum, though with more thought behind it. A student who treats his teacher contemptuously is going to be in trouble, and an employee who treats his boss contemptuously might get fired. <i>Contemptuously</i> is the opposite of <i>respectfully</i>.</p></div>`;
