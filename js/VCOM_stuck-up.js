If you talk about nothing but the awards you've won, and your friends might think you're <i>stuck-up</i>.</p><p class="long">You can also describe a stuck-up person as <i>arrogant</i>, <i>snobby</i>, or <i>conceited</i>. The adjective <i>stuck-up</i> is informal, but it's a great way to talk about someone who brags about himself and looks down on just about everyone else. Some experts guess that <i>stuck-up</i> comes from the idea of "having one's nose up in the air." We do know that it first appeared in print around 1830.</p></div>`;
