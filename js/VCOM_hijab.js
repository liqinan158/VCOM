For many such women, the <i>hijab</i> signifies both modesty and privacy.</p><p class="long">In some cases, the hijab is worn by a woman when she's with men who aren't in her own family. For other Muslims, it's equally important to wear a hijab in the presence of non-Muslims, including women. Still other practicing Muslims choose not to wear a hijab at all. The word <i>hijab</i> is Persian, from the Arabic <i>á¸¥ajaba</i>, or "veil."</p></div></div>`;
