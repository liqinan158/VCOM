Forsooth, Shakespeare wrote much of his work using <i>pentameter</i>.</p><p class="long">Whenever a line of poetry contains five units of verse — combinations of stressed and unstressed syllables, also called feet — that's an example of pentameter. The most familiar version of this type of line is <i>iambic pentameter</i>, which uses five iambs, or groups of two syllables in which the second is stressed. These lines from Shakespeare are good examples of iambic pentameter: "That time of year thou mayst in me behold/When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang." <i>Pentameter</i> comes from a Greek root meaning "having five measures."</p></div></div>`;
