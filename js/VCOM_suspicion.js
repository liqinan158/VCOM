If your friends seem to be keeping a secret from you, you might have a <i>suspicion</i> that they are planning a surprise party for your birthday.</p><p class="long"><i>Suspicion</i> can mean the same as <i>hunch</i> or <i>inkling</i>, like when you have a suspicion that your friend is hiding a flower bouquet behind his back. <i>Suspicion</i> comes from the Latin word <i>suspicere</i>, or mistrust. That's why it can mean a general bad feeling about someone or something, like neighbors who regard all new people with suspicion until they get to know them.</p></div></div>`;
