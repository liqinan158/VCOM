Classical tragedies revolve around the main character's <i>hamartia</i>, the tragic flaw that sets a series of disastrous events in motion.</p><p class="long">Achilles’ heel was his hamartia – his fatal flaw. Most tragedies couldn’t exist without hamartia. It’s in the tragic plays of the ancient Greek writer Aeschylus to works like Shakespeare's <i>Hamlet</i> and <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. In Shakespeare, examples of hamartia are Hamlet's indecisiveness and Juliet's blind loyalty to Romeo. <i>Hamartia</i> comes from a root meaning "to miss or fail."</p></div></div>`;
