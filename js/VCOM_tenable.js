To be <i>tenable</i> is to be evidence-based and well-founded.</p><p class="long"><i>Tenable</i> comes from the Latin root <i>tenir</i> which means "to hold," as in "hold together." If your plan is tenable, it will probably hold together when you execute it, or hold up to scrutiny. It's good to note that the opposite of <i>tenable</i> is untenable and not intenable, though throughout history both have been used.</p></div>`;
