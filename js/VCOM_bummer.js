You can say, "It was such a <i>bummer</i> when we missed the train," or respond to bad news by saying, "<i>Bummer</i>!" The current meaning is from 1960s slang, but in the 1880s a <i>bummer</i> was a "loafer" or "idle person," probably from the German slang word <i>bummler</i>, "loafer."</p></div></div>`;
