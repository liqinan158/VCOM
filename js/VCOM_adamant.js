var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">adamant</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">If you stubbornly refuse to change your mind about something, you are <i>adamant</i> about it.</p><p class="long">This word's story begins in ancient Greece, where philosophers spoke about a legendary unbreakable stone or metal they called <i>adamas</i> (literally, "invincible"). In English, people began to use the word to refer to something that cannot be altered, and then in the twentieth century — after <i>adamant</i> had been in English for about a thousand years — it came to be used as an adjective to mean "unyielding as stone." If you're adamant about something, no amount of persuasion is going to convince you otherwise.</p></div>`;
