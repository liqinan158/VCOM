Many classical Greek buildings have a <i>pediment</i> at the top, often above a row of columns.</p><p class="long">A classic pediment sits above the horizontal moulding (known as an <i>entablature</i>) above a window or door, which is usually supported by columns. This is true in many classical buildings, like the Greek Parthenon. You can see pediments even in relatively modern homes too, mainly in the form of a triangle or half-circle shape above a door or window. These pediments are decorative, while the originals were structural.</p></div>`;
