The first net is like a fisherman's net: it's a type of meshing (meaning it has holes) made from rope or wire. This net is used to catch fish, and the holes allow the water to pour out. Also, someone's net worth is how much money they have. A net profit is a companyâ€™s earnings. A larger net means more money.</p></div></div>`;
