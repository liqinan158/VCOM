There is nothing better than a truly <i>empathic</i> friend when you're feeling sad.</p><p class="long">Empathic people are sensitive to the way others feel, and even seem to share those feelings. If you give truly empathic support to someone who's suffered a serious, tragic loss, you may even cry along with them as they tell their story. <i>Empathic</i> is an older word than its close relation, the more common <i>empathetic</i>. These synonyms come from the Greek root <i>pathos</i>, or "feeling."</p></div>`;
