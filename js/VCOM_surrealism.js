The surrealism movement attracted writers and painters between World War I and World War II. The artists wanted to get beyond reason and logic. Instead, they looked to dreams and the power of the unconscious mind, which is weird, odd, bizarre, illogical, and fantastic. In surrealism, anything can happen—it’s the opposite of <i>realistic</i> art. We recognize the objects of surrealism, but they’re not following the rules of our world.</p></div>`;
