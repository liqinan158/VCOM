There is a faintly old-fashioned, even pedantic air to the term now, so use with caution.</p><p class="long"><i>Bailiwick</i> also can mean a geographical area over which someone or some body has legal or political control, though this is a less common meaning nowadays. It derives from the combination of the Old English term <i>bailiff,</i> meaning a local officer with certain powers, and <i>wic,</i> meaning a village. Britain's central criminal court, the famous Old Bailey, is so named because it lay on the ancient <i>bailey</i> or wall that defined the original City of London.</p></div>`;
