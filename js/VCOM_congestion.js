If there's unexpected congestion on your route to work, you'll be late. You might also use the word to describe a crush of people: "The <i>congestion</i> in the subway was terrible â€” we were packed like sardines in there." The medical kind of <i>congestion</i> describes a build up of fluid, especially the kind you feel in your sinuses when you have a bad cold.</p></div></div>`;
