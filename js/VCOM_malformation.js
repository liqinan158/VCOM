A baby born with a heart <i>malformation</i> may need surgery to correct it so that her heart functions properly.</p><p class="long"><i>Malformation</i> is commonly used in medicine for body parts that aren't formed in the typical way. Many of these are <i>congenital malformations</i>, which develop before a baby is born. Frequently, malformations result in nothing more than different-looking bodies, but sometimes they're serious enough to cause problems, like a brain malformation that causes bleeding or a palate malformation that makes eating a challenge. <i>Mal-</i> means "bad," and here it's added to <i>formation</i>, "act of being formed."</p></div></div>`;
