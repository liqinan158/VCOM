There is no variety in <i>monotony</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Monotony</i> goes back to the Greek root <i>monotonos,</i> which comes from <i>mono-,</i> "single," and <i>tonos,</i> "tone." One tone only equals <i>monotony</i>. A day with a lot of repetition, or monotony, is humdrum. When you get too much of the same boring, one-note thing, you experience monotony. Monotony.
