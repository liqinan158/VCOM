You might write a letter to your pen pal in Japan, and say, "This note comes to you from <i>afar</i>."</p><p class="long"><i>Afar</i> is a poetic and old-fashioned way to say "far away" or "distant." If your summer visitors have traveled from afar, they've come a long way to see you, and if your boyfriend moves to Australia, you might have to continue your relationship from afar. The word is a shortened form of the Old English <i>of feor</i>, in which <i>of</i> means "of" or "on," and <i>feor</i> is "far, remote, or distant."</p></div></div>`;
