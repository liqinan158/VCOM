Some people have <i>trampolines</i> in their yards so they can bounce and flip whenever they want to, while others go to <i>trampoline</i> parks to fulfill their bouncing needs.</p><p class="long">Professional trampolines are extremely sturdy, made of a large piece of durable fabric stretched tightly across a raised frame of springs. It may appear that the surface of a trampoline is stretchy, but it's actually the springs that provide the bounce, not the fabric. Jumping on a trampoline can be dangerous, especially if there are several people doing it at the same time. <i>Trampoline</i> comes from the Spanish <i>trampolin</i>, "springboard."</p></div></div>`;
