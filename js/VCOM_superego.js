They represent three parts of the human psyche, or mind. The superego is where morals and conscience come from, according to Freud. Your superego comes from what you've learned from parents, teachers, and other adults in your life. The word <i>superego</i> is the closest literal translation from the original German <i>Ã¼ber-Ich</i>.</p></div></div>`;
