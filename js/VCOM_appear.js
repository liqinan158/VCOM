Rub a magic lamp and a genie will <i>appear</i>. If that's the case, she will grant you three wishes.</p><p class="long"><i>Appear</i> comes from the Latin <i>apparere</i> meaning "to appear, come in sight, make an appearance."  Whether literally materializing or seeming to be true, the word <i>appear</i> is used to describe something coming into sight or presenting itself. The word can also be used to describe an actor appearing in a play. Julie Andrews appeared in the musical "Victor Victoria."  When someone looks happy, he appears to be happy. When a detail seems true, it appears to be true.</p></div>`;
