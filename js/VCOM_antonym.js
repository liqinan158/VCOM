var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">antonym</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">A word that has the exact opposite meaning of another word is its <i>antonym</i>. Life is full of <i>antonyms</i>, from the "stop" and "go" of a traffic signal to side-by-side restroom doors labeled "men" and "women."</p><p class="long">Most antonyms are pretty obvious, like "good" and "bad," or "black" and "white." Some words can be transformed into their <i>antonyms</i> simply by adding the prefixes "un," "in," or "non," as when "likable" is changed into its antonym, "unlikable." The word <i>antonym</i> itself takes the Greek word <i>anti</i>, meaning "opposite," and adds it to -<i>onym</i>, which comes from the Greek <i>onoma</i>, or "name." So <i>antonym</i> literally means "opposite-name."</p></div></div>`;
