People visit <i>pubs</i> to eat lunch, to drink beer, or to play darts with their friends.</p><p class="long"><i>Pub</i> is a shortened form of <i>public house</i> that dates from 1859. In the sixteenth century, a public house was first "any building open to the public," and then "an inn that sells food and drink." Today, the word <i>pub</i> is more or less synonymous with <i>tavern</i> â€” both are primarily places to drink beer, wine, or spirits, though a pub (especially in Great Britain) is seen as vital to its neighborhood, a cozy place to gather.</p></div>`;
