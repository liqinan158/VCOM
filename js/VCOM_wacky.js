Clowns are, by definition, wacky, for example. Most people have at least one wacky relative, and some are lucky enough to have entire wacky families. <i>Wacky</i> comes from the nineteenth century British slang term <i>whacky</i>, which arose from <i>whack</i>, specifically the idea of getting whacked on the head so hard that it turns you wacky.</p></div></div>`;
