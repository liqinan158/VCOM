When you tell your dog to <i>stay</i>, you expect her to keep sitting until you call her over.</p><p class="long">You can stay in the short term, like when you stay in your seat even though you're antsy, or in the long term, like when you decide to stay in Missouri after you graduate from college. You can also stay calm or stay out of trouble. Legally, to <i>stay</i> is to delay or suspend proceedings, like when a judge stays a decision. A less-common meaning of <i>stay</i> is "a support," from the Middle French <i>estaie</i>, "wood used as a support."</p></div></div>`;
