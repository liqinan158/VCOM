var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class="headword">astigmatism</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">The eye has a cornea â€” a clear, curved layer that protects it. If the cornea's shape is irregular, <i>astigmatism</i> results. People who have <i>astigmatism</i> see images as distorted, so they need to wear glasses or contact lenses.</p><p class="long">Sometimes people mistakenly say, "One of my eyes has a stigmatism." But the <i>a</i> in <i>astigmatism</i> is important to its meaning. The prefix <i>a-</i> means "without." <i>Stigma</i> is Greek for "point," so an eye that is "without point" is one that doesn't allow light rays to meet at a single point or focus. Since astigmatism is a condition, you don't need the article <i>an</i> before it: "My eye has astigmatism," not "My eye has an astigmatism."</p></div>`;
