An adjudication results in a formal judgment or decision given by a court.  Often these adjudications lead to the making of history, like the Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka trial in which the process of adjudication resulted in a decision that declared state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students unconstitutional.</p></div></div>`;
