If you love the new shoes you just bought, you may defend your purchase by saying they were <i>certainly</i> worth the money you paid.</p><p class="long">The word <i>certainly</i> emphasizes that you’re positive about something. When you hear thunder and look up at a gray sky, you might say it will certainly rain. If you’re on a diet, you could say that you will certainly avoid chocolate cake. <i>Certainly</i> can also be used to answer a question in the affirmative. If your boss asks to speak to you, you might answer, “<i>Certainly</i>.” It’s just a formal way of saying “yes.”</p></div></div>`;
