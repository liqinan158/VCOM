Most people walk by placing their weight first on one <i>heel</i>, then shifting to their toes before stepping with the opposite foot.</p><p class="long">If you take tap dancing lessons, you'll learn to tap with both your toes and your heels — feet have heels, and so do shoes. The base of the palm of your hand is also a <i>heel</i>, and when you walk your dog on a leash, keeping her at your side, you're teaching her to <i>heel</i>. The word also describes the very end of a loaf of bread, or an utter jerk — this informal meaning comes from U.S. mobster slang.</p></div>`;
