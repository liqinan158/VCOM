If your mom wants to have a serious discussion about college, but you can't stop talking about your favorite reality TV shows, she might complain about your <i>frivolousness</i>.</p><p class="long">Do you burst into song when your teacher asks you a serious question? Or dress in elaborate costumes that trip you up and get in the way while you're playing volleyball in gym class? Your frivolousness means you're carefree and happy â€” you probably spend a lot of time laughing. But it can get in the way when you really should be listening hard or getting down to work. The root of <i>frivolousness</i> means "broken, crumbling, or worthless."</p></div>`;
