When you vote in a <i>primary</i>, that is the first election in a series. When a matter is of <i>primary</i> concern, it means it's of first importance. <i>Primary</i> school is the first you go to (after nursery school, at least).</p><p class="long">There's an interesting alternate system for counting first, second, third, etc. up to tenth. It's <i>primary</i>, <i>secondary</i>, <i>tertiary</i>, <i>quaternary</i>, <i>quinary</i>, <i>senary</i>, <i>septenary</i>, <i>octonary</i>, <i>nonary</i>, and <i>denary</i>. There's also a word for twelfth, <i>duodenary</i>, though that — along with all the words after tertiary — is rarely used.</p></div>`;
