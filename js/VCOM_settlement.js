If a bunch of people build houses on the moon together, they’ll have the first lunar <i>settlement</i>. A <i>settlement</i> is also the resolution of something such as a lawsuit.</p><p class="long">One kind of settlement is a place where people live. This can be a community that's smaller than a town, like a village. Also, if one country establishes a colony somewhere else, that can be called a settlement. The other kind of settlement happens when something is settled, like the end of a disagreement. A lawsuit is ended if there's a settlement — both parties make an agreement that often involves money. A settlement brings closure and resolution.</p></div>`;
