Traditionally, the salutatorian gives the opening remarks at the graduation ceremony. So, just as a <i>salutation</i> is a greeting, a salutatorian is responsible for offering a formal greeting at the event. Having been a salutatorian looks great on a resume, as long as you spell it correctly.</p></div>`;
