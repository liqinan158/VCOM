Prancing around your backyard in a trench coat and fake mustache during daylight might elicit weird looks from your neighbors; do it at night, though, so that your silhouette glides past their windows, and what appeared innocent enough hours before will quickly transition to <i>suspicious</i>.</p><p class="long">Use this adjective to describe a behavior or event that arouses doubt or mistrust. How to avoid appearing <i>suspicious</i>? Well, for one, stop pausing mid-conversation to take covert notes in that little journal of yours. And two, don’t wear sunglasses indoors, and don’t try to walk without making a sound. That will make people cagey, which is a synonym for <i>suspicious</i>.  Other synonyms include <i>apprehensive</i>, <i>doubtful</i>, <i>wary</i>, and <i>watchful</i>.</p></div>`;
