It's another term for "phylogenetics," the study of evolution, diversity, and the way different organisms and species are related to each other. The German biologist Ernst Heinrich Haeckel was the first to use the word <i>phylogeny</i>, in 1866, and Darwin used it soon after. It combines the Greek <i>phylos</i>, "race," with <i>geneia</i>, "origin."</p></div>`;
