If someone tells you that he's in <i>aviation</i> school, that means he is learning how to fly a plane.</p><p class="long"><i>Aviation</i> comes from the Latin <i>avis</i> meaning "bird," an appropriate translation given that aviation deals with travel by air, specifically in a plane. The aviation industry is the business sector dedicated to manufacturing and operating all types of aircraft.
