When you walk through the woods on a foggy morning, the trees may all have a mysterious, <i>nebulous</i> look to them.</p><p class="long">When you fly in a plane on an overcast day, the land below you looks nebulous and indistinct. You can also use <i>nebulous</i> in a more figurative way, to describe vague ideas or fuzzy concepts. <i>Nebulous</i> comes from the Latin <i>nebulosus</i>, "cloudy, misty, or foggy." Its root is <i>nebula</i>, which is "vapor or fog" in Latin and was adopted by astronomers in the 1700s to mean "a cloud of gas and dust in outer space."</p></div></div>`;
