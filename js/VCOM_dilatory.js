Remember when your math teacher asked you to work out a problem on the board and you tried to get her talking about her favorite theorems instead? That was a <i>dilatory</i> tactic.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>dilatory</i> comes from the Latin root word <i>dilator</i>, a noun that means "someone who puts off things" or "a procrastinator." If you are always late to appointments, people may accuse you of being dilatory, especially if they think you don't have a good excuse.</p></div></div>`;
