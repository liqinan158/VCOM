An <i>incentive</i> is something that stimulates you to take action or work harder.</p><p class="long">This noun dates back to Middle English, from Late Latin <i>incentivum,</i> from <i>incentivus</i>, "stimulating." In Latin, <i>incentivus</i> meant "setting the tune," from <i>incinere</i>, "to sing." The related English verb is <i>incentivize</i>. The less common verb <i>incent</i> was first used in the early 1980s, and has been criticized as business jargon.</p></div>`;
