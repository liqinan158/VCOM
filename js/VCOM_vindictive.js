If you forget to say hello to them one day in the hall, they will carry a grudge against you into next week.</p><p class="long">Vindictive is often paired with mean, as in "the atmosphere of the cheerleading squad at my new school was vindictive and mean and I wanted nothing to do with it." <i>Vindictive</i> rumors show a spirit full of revenge. <i>Vindictive</i> is from Latin <i>vindicta</i> "revenge." The related Latin verb <i>vindicare</i> has the very different meaning "to defend or clear someone from guilt," and this is the source of the English verb <i>vindicate</i>.</p></div>`;
