You can add some <i>garbanzos</i> to your salad, or mash them up with tahini, lemon, and olive oil to make hummus.</p><p class="long">Many Middle Eastern, North African, and Indian dishes use garbanzos, from falafel to chana masala. The majority of the world's garbanzos are grown in India, though the word itself is Spanish and is mainly used in North America (other English speakers call them chickpeas). During World War I, roasted and ground garbanzos were sometimes used as a coffee substitute, particularly in Germany.</p></div></div>`;
