The two-l spelling is probably influenced by the word <i>million</i>.</p><p class="long">The spelling of this word, describing a deep, rich shade of red often seen in enameled Chinese lacquerware, is a bit tricky. The standard spelling is with one "l" because it came to us from the French word <i>vermeil</i>. But because it looks and sounds so much like <i>million</i>, people are often tempted to spell it that way. Though dictionaries tend to accept both variants, the one-l spelling is much more common in standard edited prose.</p></div></div>`;
