Any professional who injures a client or patient through negligence risks being accused of malpractice, and possibly taken to court. The prefix <i>mal</i> means "bad," from the Latin word <i>malus</i>, or "evil." <i>Practice</i> comes from the Modern Latin <i>practicare</i>, "to practice." If a doctor practices medicine badly enough that it hurts someone, that's malpractice.</p></div>`;
