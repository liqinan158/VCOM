You can play <i>chords</i> on a piano or guitar, but not on an instrument that plays one note at a time, like a trumpet.</p><p class="long"><i>Chord</i> comes from the French word for agreement, <i>accord</i>, so in music it means sounds that go together, or agree with each other. You can also use <i>chord</i> figuratively. If a book "strikes a chord" with you, you feel connected to it. In math, a <i>chord</i> is the straight line that connects two points on a curve.</p></div>`;
