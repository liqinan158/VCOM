An <i>aversive</i> smell in your friend's kitchen before her dinner party might cause you to lose your appetite.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>aversive</i> is good for describing unpleasant or repellent things, like an aversive reaction to riding in a small boat on a choppy sea. It's more commonly used in very formal writing, however, especially on the topics of psychology and sociology. An aversive stimulus in psychological studies tends to change behavior through some kind of punishment or unpleasant sensation. The Latin root of <i>aversive</i> is <i>aversus</i>, "turned away or turned back."</p></div></div>`;
