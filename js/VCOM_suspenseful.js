Waiting for the scary twist at the end of a good book is suspenseful, and it can be suspenseful to watch someone open an enormous birthday present. <i>Suspense</i> and <i>suspenseful</i> come from the Old French <i>sospense</i>, "delay," and a Latin root meaning "to hang up or interrupt."</p></div>`;
