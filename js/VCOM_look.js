When you look at something, you see it. <i>Look</i> can also describe how something appears, like when your dog looks sad, or something likely to happen, like a gray day that looks like rain. As a noun, <i>look</i> describes someone's style of dress, like your brother, whose rock star look gets lots of compliments â€” except from Grandpa.</p></div></div>`;
