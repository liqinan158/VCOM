Eastern and ancient Greek religions, as well as Christianity and Judaism, describe various types of theophanies. The Greek roots mean "god" and "appearance," and they show up in hundreds of other English words â€” <i>theology</i>, <i>theocracy</i>, and <i>monotheism</i> all come from <i>theos</i>, or god, and <i>diaphanous</i>, <i>sycophant</i>, and <i>phantom</i> come from <i>phainein</i>, "to show or to appear."</p></div>`;
