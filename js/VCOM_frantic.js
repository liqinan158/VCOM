She's a crazed sort of agitated and goes on a <i>frantic</i> search for her child. A scene is <i>frantic</i> if there's lots of action with little order.</p><p class="long"><i>Frantic</i> is related to frenzy and both were originally ways to describe mental illness. Hundreds of years ago, if you were frantic, you were stark raving mad. Today, <i>frantic</i> implies fast wild movements or a desperate attempt to do something. On Christmas Eve, the scene at the mall was frantic with shoppers desperately searching for their last few gifts. And a wild party would only be called frantic if the police were called and everyone rushed to get away.</p></div></div>`;
