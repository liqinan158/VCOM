An amateur kayaker might <i>overturn</i> her boat, while a judge may decide to <i>overturn</i> a previous judgment.</p><p class="long">When you overturn a wheelbarrow or a tricycle, you literally turn it over. When judges overturn earlier rulings or voters overturn laws, they make them invalid, essentially reversing them. An earlier, more intense metaphorical meaning of this word was "violently overthrow a ruler or rulers." <i>Overturn</i> was originally used in the 13th century to describe a turning wheel.</p></div>`;
