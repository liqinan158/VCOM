Most <i>hotels</i> provide accommodations for sleeping, with minibars, pools, and ice machines to keep you entertained.</p><p class="long">While in Australia and New Zealand a <i>hotel</i> can also be a bar or a pub, most English-speakers recognize this word as the equivalent of an inn. Simple hotels give you a bed to sleep in and a bathroom to use, while fancier hotels might have beautiful furnishings, separate sitting rooms, swimming pools, and cafes. In the 1760s, <i>hotel</i> was defined as "an inn of the better sort."</p></div>`;
