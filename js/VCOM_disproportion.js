A <i>disproportion</i> is a lack of balance or equality.</p><p class="long"><i>Disproportion</i> contains the prefix <i>dis</i>- which means “not” or “away from,” and the noun <i>proportion</i> which means “a proper, equal share.” Therefore, <i>disproportion</i> refers to an unequal and improper share. This noun is usually used in a negative context to point out something that is imbalanced or unfair, such as a disproportion of funds, food, or freedoms. <i>Disproportion</i> is also used in reference to the body; if your feet seem too big, they are in disproportion to your body.</p></div>`;
