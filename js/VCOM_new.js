Anything can be new: a country, an idea, a product. If you spend half an hour watching TV, you'll see an incredible selection of <i>new</i> items being advertised.</p><p class="long">There are lots of shades of meaning attached to <i>new</i>. For example, by its very nature something that's new is unfamiliar, and the two words are often used interchangeably. <i>New</i> can also mean something different from what has gone before — as in a new political strategy — or, as advertising would have you believe, something fresh and original, like that new and improved version of your favorite laundry detergent you just bought.</p></div>`;
