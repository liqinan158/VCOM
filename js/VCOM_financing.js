If you don't have enough money to buy the hot new video-game, you could try telling your parents that you need help <i>financing</i> your leisure activities.</p><p class="long">Notice the similarity between <i>finance</i> and <i>finish</i>?  The root of both words is <i>fin</i>, which is Latin for "end," or "limit."  Originally, <i>financing</i> meant ending a debt.  If you owed money, you might ask a bank to finance you.  Eventually people began asking banks for money even when they didn't owe anything.  Now the word can be used to talk about getting money for almost any project, from a video-game purchase to a war.</p></div></div>`;
