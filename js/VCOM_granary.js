Not much more to say, really. A <i>granary</i> is where grain is stored.</p><p class="long">One clear way to remember the meaning of <i>granary</i> is that it sounds like what it is. If I were to ask you to invent a word that means "the place where grain is stored" you'd very likely come up with <i>granary</i> — though admittedly, the spelling is a little different. In the same way that wine comes from a winery, you'll find granaries the world over filled with, well, grain.</p></div>`;
