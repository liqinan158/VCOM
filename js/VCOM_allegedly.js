(It's from the medieval English word <i>allege,</i> meaning "quoted" or "brought forth in court.") For less serious matters, such as whether or not your boyfriend called you a liar, the word <i>supposedly</i> is generally used. Though watch out, because if you take him to court, you will become "<i>allegedly</i> a liar."</p></div>`;
