If your mom baked a lot when you were a kid, the smell of cookies in the oven is probably <i>evocative</i> of your childhood.</p><p class="long"><i>Evocative</i> comes from the Latin word <i>evocare</i>, which means to "call out" or "summon."  Think of a batch of cookies summoning a memory from your childhood. To summon something you need a voice, and indeed, the Latin word for voice is <i>vocare</i>.  Other related words include the noun <i>vocation</i>, which means "a calling."</p></div></div>`;
