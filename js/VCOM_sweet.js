People who are <i>sweet</i> are super nice, like that <i>sweet</i> lunch lady who gives you an extra cookie.</p><p class="long"><i>Sweet</i> can be an adjective or a noun. It can describe something pleasing to the senses, like a sweet song, or when you're playing basketball and get nothing but net. Sweet! As a noun, it's a confection, a little something for dessert. The poet Khalil Gibran said, “Friendship is always a sweet responsibility, never an opportunity.” Don’t opportunistically take your friends for granted, or you could become the target of some sweet revenge.</p></div></div>`;
