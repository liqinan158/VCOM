It's a legal term used in regards to orphans and foster children who need looking after.</p><p class="long">This Latin phrase, used primarily in legal contexts, usually refers to a person or institution that has parent-like responsibility for a minor. An orphanage will have many duties to be carried out in loco parentis. A foster parent will feed, clothe, and shelter a child in loco parentis. In Batman comics and movies, Alfred Pennyworth takes care of young Bruce Wayne in loco parentis, because the Waynes were murdered. This phrase is unnecessary if a child has a parent around.</p></div>`;
