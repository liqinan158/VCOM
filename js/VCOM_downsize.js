You might <i>downsize</i> your collection of vintage china by selling everything that's nicked or chipped.</p><p class="long">You can downsize the items you own by giving them away, and you can downsize your living situation by moving from a huge house to a very small apartment. When a company downsizes, it almost always means it's reducing the number of employees, making the company smaller by laying them off. This last meaning has only been around since the 1980s.</p></div></div>`;
