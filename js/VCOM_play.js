Your city might offer a free Shakespeare <i>play</i> in the park every year.</p><p class="long">If you take part in a game or a sport, you <i>play</i> it. You might love to play charades, but no one is going to want to play with you if you keep forgetting the rules. The verb <i>play</i> also means to make music, like when you play your ukulele. And if you toy with a concept — like forming a ukulele orchestra — you <i>play</i> around with the idea.</p></div>`;
