If you tried like crazy to run a marathon but couldn't finish, your efforts were abortive. If someone tripped you during the marathon, their efforts were abortive too. Abortive things always lead to the words "The end." <i>Abortive</i> can also be a way of avoiding the word <i>unsuccessful</i>.</p></div>`;
