Getting your cat to wear a leash was quite a <i>feat</i>.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>feat</i> developed from the Latin <i>facere</i>, meaning "make do."  Today, it gets applied to a deed that's noble or out of the ordinary.  Have you ever accomplished amazing feats in your dreams, like flying?  If so, I hope you didn't wake up on the roof.  Maybe you perform feats of daring in your everyday life, if you're a firefighter or a tightrope walker.  If you're afraid of heights, just taking the glass elevator counts as a courageous feat!</p></div></div>`;
