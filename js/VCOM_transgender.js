Most often, someone who identifies as transgender feels that he or she was born into the wrong gender â€” for example, a boy who feels strongly that he is actually female. In some cases, a transgender person switches genders. The key to this word is the Latin prefix <i>trans</i>, which means "across," but also "beyond."</p></div>`;
