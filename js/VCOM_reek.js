Birds are falling from the sky because of the fumes. You might throw up from one whiff. Whatever it is, it <i>reeks</i>.</p><p class="long">Shakespeare famously wrote about the "breath that from my mistress <i>reeks</i>," but that's not a nice way to talk about a girlfriend. The word usually describes smells, but can also be used to suggest something fishy, as in "the suspicious transactions <i>reeked</i> of mob involvement." But noses everywhere agree: Whether it's coming from your sneakers or from the aftermath of a shady deal, if something reeks â€” it stinks to high heaven.</p></div></div>`;
