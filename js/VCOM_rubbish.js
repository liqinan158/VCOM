The word is more commonly used by speakers of British English than by speakers of American English.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>rubbish</i> also means writing or speech that is worthless, untrue, or nonsense, especially in British English. Your teacher might tell you that your paper thesis is a load of rubbish if it states that Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt were aliens sent from another planet to "fix" World War II. In British slang, <i>rubbish</i> is also a verb that means to criticize strongly. Don't be surprised when the professor rubbishes your paper â€” he's a well-known Churchill scholar.</p></div>`;
