var custom_content = `<meta charset='utf-8'/><div class='VCOM'><div class="headword">mollify</div><div class="blurb"><p class="short">To <i>mollify</i> is to calm someone down, talk them off the ledge, make amends, maybe even apologize.</p><p class="long"><i>Mollify</i> comes from the Latin <i>mollificare</i> to "make soft," and that's still at the heart of the word. When you <i>mollify</i> someone, you smooth things over, even if you're maybe still a little mad: "I was angry that the guy took my seat, but I was <i>mollified</i> when he offered me one closer to the band." Unlike the sharp sounds of <i>antagonize</i>, there are only soft sounds in this word that means to make someone feel soft and cuddly. Although dryer sheets might soften your clothes, they don't <i>mollify</i> them (unless your clothes were really mad at you before).</p></div></div>`;
