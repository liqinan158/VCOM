Each <i>hoof</i> protects the animal and helps it to walk and run.</p><p class="long">A <i>hoof</i> is made of keratin, just like your fingernails, but it tends to be thicker and harder since it has to bear the weight of the animal. <i>Hoof</i> can also be a verb that, surprisingly enough, applies to humans. Maybe you have offered someone a ride, only to be told, "No, I think I'll just hoof it," meaning walk or  otherwise go on foot. <i>Hoof</i> is sometimes substituted for <i>dance</i> if the person doing it is getting paid.</p></div>`;
