Most <i>patrolmen</i> keep an eye on a certain area while walking or driving around it.</p><p class="long">The word <i>patrolman</i> is a bit old fashioned, since it's really only appropriate for a man â€” you can call a female officer a "patrolwoman," but it's simpler to just call them both <i>police officers</i>. <i>Patrolman</i> was first used in the 1840s to distinguish British constables who walked a beat, patrolling a specific neighborhood or region on foot. <i>Patrol</i> comes from the French <i>patrouille</i>, "a night watch."</p></div>`;
