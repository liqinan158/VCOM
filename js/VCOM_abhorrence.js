If you have an <i>abhorrence</i> of violence, you probably won't want to watch "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."</p><p class="long">The Latin ancestor of <i>abhorrence</i> isn't all that different from today's word or its meaning — it comes from <i>abhorrēre,</i> which means "to shrink back from," and it became synonymous with <i>loathing</i> in the early 17th century. Note the similarity to the word <i>horror</i> — a good way to remember the word's meaning. The Polish physicist Joseph Rotblat knew the power of the word when he used it to refer to the "widespread instinctive abhorrence of nuclear weapons.”</p></div>`;
