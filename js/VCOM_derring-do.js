Try <i>derring-do</i>! Your adventurous cousin's stories of <i>derring-do</i> might include climbing mountains, wrestling alligators, and bungee jumping.</p><p class="long">This old-fashioned word is perfect if you want a funny way to talk about slightly reckless feats of bravery. A series of misprints and misunderstandings led to poet Edmund Spenser's interpretation of <i>derrynge do</i> (intended to mean "in daring to do") as a noun meaning "heroism." He used it that way in his epic poem, <i>The Faerie Queene.</i> Sir Walter Scott was the first to use <i>derring-do</i> as one word, in his 1820 novel "Ivanhoe."</p></div>`;
