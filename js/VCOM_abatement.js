If you start bluntly telling people what you think of them, you might see an <i>abatement</i> in their friendliness toward you.</p><p class="long"><i>Abatement</i> comes from the French word for batter, but <i>abatement</i> doesn’t usually have a negative sense — abatement reduces something, but doesn’t beat it to a pulp. Many cities offer tax abatements to reward businesses starting up in areas they want to develop. If your heat doesn't work, you could sue your landlord for a rent abatement, since you shouldn't have to pay rent for days you don't have heat.</p></div></div>`;
