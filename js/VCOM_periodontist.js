So a simple cavity doesn't require a visit to the periodontist, but gum inflammation or the need for a dental implant would warrant a trip to this dental specialist. The word <i>periodontist</i> comes from <i>periodontal</i>, literally "around the tooth," from the Greek roots <i>peri-</i>, "around," and <i>odontos</i>, "tooth."</p></div></div>`;
