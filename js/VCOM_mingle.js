At a club you may hear laughter that seems to <i>mingle</i> with the sound of the band playing in the background.</p><p class="long"><i>Mingle</i> often describes abstract things, like smells or tastes or feelings. The look on your face may mingle compassion and horror when you taste your brother’s attempt at making Key Lime Pie. <i>Mingle</i> can also describe what you do at a social gathering when you move around a lot and talk to many different people. If you’re an outgoing person, at a party you probably like to mingle and talk to friends and also chat with new people.</p></div>`;
