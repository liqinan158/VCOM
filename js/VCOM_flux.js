If your likes, dislikes, attitudes, dreams, and even friends are changing all the time, you may be in <i>flux</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Flux</i> can also mean being unsure about a decision. Suppose you just had a great job interview and suddenly your friend invites you to go to Australia with her. You don't know what to do because you don't want to miss a call about the job â€” or Sydney! You're in flux until you hear from the potential employer. Another kind of flux is liquid moving or flowing, like the flux of water under a sheet of melting ice.</p></div></div>`;
