You don't really have 2000 pounds of homework, do you? Also, when art depicts a figure from life it is <i>figurative</i>, like a <i>figurative</i> drawing of a dancer.</p><p class="long">The adjective <i>figurative</i> comes from the Old French word <i>figuratif</i>, which means “metaphorical.”  Any figure of speech — a statement or phrase not intended to be understood literally — is figurative. You say your hands are frozen, or you are so hungry you could eat a horse. That's being figurative. In art, <i>figure</i> means "human or animal form," so a figurative drawing might show horses running across a field.</p></div>`;
