If you were staying at a hotel, the <i>concierge</i> could recommend where to find the best coffee in town.</p><p class="long">A helpful concierge is one of the perks of a nice hotel; the concierge's job isn't to carry your bags or check you in, but she will help you with almost anything else, including buying tickets and making reservations for you. The root of <i>concierge</i> is the Latin word <i>conservus</i>, or "fellow slave," which makes sense when you think about how hard a concierge works to make hotel guests happy.</p></div></div>`;
