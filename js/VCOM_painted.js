Several types of animals are also <i>painted</i> because they have bright or varied stripes of color on their bodies â€” like painted turtles' colorful shells and painted storks' bright feathers. <i>Painted</i> comes from <i>paint</i> and its Latin root, <i>pingere</i>, "to paint, embroider, or tattoo."</p></div>`;
