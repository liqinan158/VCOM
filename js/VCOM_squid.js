The largest <i>squid</i> ever found was nearly 60 feet long!</p><p class="long">Like their octopus relatives, squid are cephalopods, or mollusks with prominent heads and many arms. Squid can swim extremely fast by sucking in water and propelling it out (just like jet propulsion), and their skin can change color so they blend in with their surroundings. Squid squirt a kind of dark ink to confuse predators; some language experts believe that <i>squid</i> was once sailors' slang for <i>squirt</i>.</p></div>`;
