When you wake up shivering on a winter morning, you may want to announce that you're not getting out of bed on such a <i>gelid</i> day.</p><p class="long">Use this adjective to describe frozen things â€” like a gelid skating pond, your gelid fingers when you forget to wear your gloves, or the gelid breeze coming in through the gap under your front door. <i>Gelid</i> is also useful for figuratively icy things, like your teacher's gelid smile when you ask him if the class can take the day off. <i>Gelid</i> comes from the Latin <i>gelidus</i>, "icy, cold, or frosty," from <i>gelum</i>, "frost or intense cold."</p></div></div>`;
