As an old saying goes, "Give someone a fish, they eat for a day, <i>teach</i> someone to fish and they eat for a lifetime."  I hope they like seafood.</p><p class="long">The Old English word <i>tǣcan</i>, which became the Middle English <i>techen</i>, meant "to show or point out."  But the Old English also had another word for <i>teach</i> — <i>læran</i> — which eventually became the modern "learn," with the current meaning of receiving knowledge rather than giving it.  If someone tries to "teach you a lesson," he or she tries to punish you for something you've done in order that you won't do it again.</p></div></div>`;
