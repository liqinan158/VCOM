If you <i>landscape</i> your yard with flowering plants and trees — and you have a green thumb — you'll end up with a beautiful garden.</p><p class="long">If you paint nature scenes, like mountains, lakes, or fields, your art is called <i>landscape</i> painting. If you don't paint that well, however, and the perspective on your landscapes is always a little bit off, you can try landscape photography instead. Any expanse of natural scenery that can be seen from one viewpoint is also called a <i>landscape</i>. The artistic meaning of <i>landscape</i> is the earliest, dating from the 1600s.</p></div></div>`;
