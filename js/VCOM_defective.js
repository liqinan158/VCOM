A defective blender won't mix your morning smoothie the way you want it to, and a defective law doesn't serve the people it's meant to protect. A very old-fashioned meaning of <i>defective</i>, which is considered quite offensive today, is "mentally ill" or "mentally handicapped." The Late Latin root is <i>defectivus</i>, "to fail, revolt, or desert."</p></div></div>`;
