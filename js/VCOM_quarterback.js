When football players huddle in a circle to plan their plays, the <i>quarterback</i> usually decides which strategy to use.</p><p class="long">In many ways, a quarterback is a team's leader, although ultimately the coach is in charge. When an NFL team wins the Super Bowl, the quarterback accepts the winning trophy. As a verb, to <i>quarterback</i> either means, literally, to play the position of quarterback, or to lead a team or project: "The teacher asked me to <i>quarterback</i> the class Halloween party." <i>Quarterback</i> comes from the starting field position, between the center and the halfback.</p></div></div>`;
