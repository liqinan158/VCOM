Your friends — if you have any — may also complain about your arrogance, vanity, and egotism.</p><p class="long">A conceit can also be an artistic device — probably a little forced — like the plot of a movie built on the <i>conceit</i> of everything that happens being foretold in song. You might find an architectural <i>conceit</i> in a Baroque palace, where you think you’re looking down a long hallway lined with columns, but when you get closer you see that it's really a mural painted in perspective so that the columns only seem to disappear in the distance.</p></div></div>`;
