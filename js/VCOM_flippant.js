His reply was casual to the point of sarcasm and disrespect.</p><p class="long">When it first showed up in the English language around the 17th century, <i>flippant</i> meant glib and talkative. But over the years it has developed a more negative connotation. Today <i>flippant</i> is used to describe a blas√© attitude or comment in a situation that calls for seriousness. Make a flippant comment about your friend's mother and the odds are good that they'll be offended.</p></div></div>`;
