You'll know that <i>knavery</i> happened last night if you wake to find toilet paper strung from the branches of your trees.</p><p class="long">The noun <i>knavery</i> comes from <i>knave</i>, an old-fashioned word meaning "rascal or rogue." Shakespeare was especially famous for using <i>knave</i> as an insult, and <i>knavery</i> reflects this sense of a foolish and terrible person who's up to no good. Dirty political tricks can be called knavery, as can rascally practical jokes, and even wickedness, dishonesty, and cruelty.</p></div>`;
