Enjoy a healthy <i>snack</i> such as apples with peanut butter, or indulge in a bag of chips. After a huge breakfast, you might just want a light <i>snack</i> instead of lunch.</p><p class="long">You can use <i>snack</i> as a verb too: "After school, I like to <i>snack</i> on fruit and cookies and listen to music." <i>Snack</i> originally meant "snap or bite" in Middle English, usually in the context of a dog's bite. The noun was also used in the 17th century to mean "a portion or share," which led to the now-obsolete phrase "go <i>snacks</i>," meaning "share with someone."</p></div></div>`;
