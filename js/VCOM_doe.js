You might spot a <i>doe</i> in the spring, walking through the woods with her babies.</p><p class="long">There are several four-legged mammals whose females are called does, including goats, antelopes, and even rabbits. The males are called <i>bucks</i>. The words <i>doe</i> and <i>buck</i> are like <i>woman</i> and <i>man</i> for the furry set. Oddly, you can also refer to female guinea pigs, mice, and weasels as does, although <i>doe</i> usually means a deer. The word comes from the Old English <i>da</i>, or "female deer," which probably stems from a Celtic root.</p></div></div>`;
