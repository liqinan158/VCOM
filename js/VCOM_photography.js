If you're very interested in <i>photography</i>, you might want to learn how to develop your own film in a darkroom. You should also practice yelling "Say cheese!"</p><p class="long">The word <i>photography</i> combines Greek roots <i>phōtos</i>, "light," and <i>graphé</i>, "represent by drawing lines" — so photography is essentially "drawing with light." Since it was invented in the 19th century, the art of capturing images using light has expanded far beyond what the original photographers could have imagined. Today many of us practice photography using our phones. Other advances through the years have included color film, instant photographs, and digital photography, among many others.</p></div></div>`;
