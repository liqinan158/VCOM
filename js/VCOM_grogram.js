The original French term was <i>gros grain</i>, for "coarse grain.” Grogram was once commonly used, but it had pretty much finished its time in the fashion spotlight by the 19th century. The more generic term <i>grosgrain</i> refers to similar material today. Since grogram is rough, it was good for making a jacket but not ideal for underwear.</p></div></div>`;
