If you painted an uncanny copy of the "Mona Lisa" and tried to pass it off as the original, you'd have a <i>counterfeit</i> on your hands.</p><p class="long">An exact imitation of anything — a work of art, a ten dollar bill — is a counterfeit, and the act of creating the fake copy is the verb to <i>counterfeit</i>.  You can also describe the forgery using the adjective form of <i>counterfeit</i>: a counterfeit Rolex watch. In Old French, the word <i>contre</i>, "counter or against",  together with the word <i>faire</i>, "to make," joined together to mean "to make in imitation," which led to our <i>counterfeit</i>.</p></div>`;
