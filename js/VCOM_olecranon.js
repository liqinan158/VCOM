It’s on the end of the ulna.

The root of this word, the <i>cranon</i> (like cranium) comes from the Greek word for “skull or head” and indeed it’s like the head of your elbow.  When you extend your arm, the olecranon can’t be seen. When you bend your arm, there the olecranon is again, ready to elbow someone out of the way.</p></div>`;
