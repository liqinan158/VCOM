Refugees fleeing war can find security and comfort thanks to <i>resettlement</i>.</p><p class="long"><i>Resettlement</i> can simply mean "settling in a new place," but it almost always describes the assistance given to refugees by a government or other organization. People whose lives and freedom have been threatened at home because of war, disaster, or persecution can apply for asylum and go through the process of resettlement to make their homes in new countries. Sometimes this word is twisted, as when the Nazis described deporting German Jews to concentration camps as "resettlement to the East."</p></div>`;
