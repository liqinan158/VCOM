To build a campfire, you need both logs and <i>tinder</i>.</p><p class="long">You might also call tinder <i>kindling</i>. This material is so dry and flammable that it quickly catches on fire and burns long enough to ignite the larger pieces of wood in your fireplace or outdoor fire pit. The word stems from the Old English <i>tynder</i>, from a Proto-Germanic root meaning "ignite" or "kindle."</p></div>`;
