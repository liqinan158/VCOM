To <i>rook</i> someone is to trick them, like a sneaky old crow. And in chess, the <i>rook</i> is the piece that looks like a tower or a castle.</p><p class="long">You can tell the difference between a rook and a crow, which are both members of the bird family <i>Corvus</i>, by the pale skin around a rook's bill in front of its eyes and the shaggy feathers around its legs. Urban rooks, like their crow cousins, prefer areas near human activity where they can scavenge food â€” although they also eat earthworms and insects. You're most likely to see rooks in northern Europe, Iceland, and parts of Scandinavia (or on a chess board :) .</p></div></div>`;
