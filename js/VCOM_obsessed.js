When someone is obsessed, they've lost control of their feelings about the object of their obsession. The adjective <i>obsessed</i> is often used to simply mean "very interested," but when someone is truly obsessed, their interest has become compulsive, and they've begun to lose control over it. The Latin root is <i>obsessus</i>, or "besieged," and when you're obsessed, your mind has been <i>besieged</i> by uncontrollable thoughts of something.</p></div></div>`;
