A plant <i>taxonomist</i> for example, might study the origins and relationships between different types of roses while an insect taxonomist might focus on the relationships between different types of beetles.</p><p class="long">A <i>taxonomist</i> is not to be confused with a taxidermist, a person who specializes in the stuffing and mounting of dead animals. It's true, both words share their origins in the Greek <i>taxis</i> meaning "arrangement."  But in the case of a taxonomist, it's not dead animals that are being arranged, its hierarchies of species.</p></div></div>`;
