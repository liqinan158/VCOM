Your neighbor might be so proud and protective of his brand new car that even a <i>nick</i> in its paint would be deeply upsetting to him.</p><p class="long">To make a nick is also to <i>nick</i>: you might accidentally nick your dog when you're cutting tangles and mats out of her fur, or nick yourself when you're gathering up pieces of a broken glass in the sink. Informally, you also nick someone when you cheat them out of some cash or nick something when you steal it. If help arrives "in the <i>nick</i> of time," it comes at the very last possible second.</p></div></div>`;
