You need a <i>pole</i> for hanging a flag, catching fish, or setting up a tent.</p><p class="long">There are many kinds of poles, from the poles skiers use to balance and push themselves forward to the long, flexible pole a pole vaulter uses to help her jump over a high bar. When someone mentions the North or South Pole, they mean the points on either side of the Earth that mark the ends of its axis of rotation. This kind of pole comes from the Latin <i>polus</i>, "end of an axis" or "the heavens."</p></div></div>`;
