Numbered diagrams and other <i>illustrations</i> can help you avoid the dreaded pile of "leftover" pieces.</p><p class="long">An illustration can also be a helpful example that isn't visual at all. A coworker who comes to work with a terrible cold and gives it to the whole office is an illustration of what happens when a boss discourages the use of sick days. You hope that the boss isn't an illustration of management at that company! If so, maybe these workers do need a visual: an illustration that shows hand-washing techniques and other ways to avoid germs.</p></div>`;
