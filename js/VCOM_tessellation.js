You could compliment your friend's newly tiled kitchen floor by saying, "What gorgeous <i>tessellation</i>!"</p><p class="long">If you imagine a patchwork of tiles, or the patterns in a quilt, you're picturing one kind of tessellation. Another type is mathematical tessellation, which is closely related to the first kind â€” it's the geometric repetition of one shape over and over again. The Latin root word <i>tessellatus</i> describes something made of small stones or tiles.</p></div></div>`;
