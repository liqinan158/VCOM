You can sometimes find <i>clams</i> by digging in the sand close to the seashore.</p><p class="long">The largest clams are used for food by humans, including the scallop, a particularly big form of clam. When you order soup in New England, it's not unlikely that it will be clam chowder, a creamy, thick stew with potatoes and pieces of clam. When <i>clam</i> is a verb, it means "to dig <i>clams</i> on the beach," and if your friend offers to pay you 1000 <i>clams</i> for your old car, she means "dollars."</p></div>`;
